"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The place is a complete mess and all of the customers are sick to the stomach after eating too much Krabby Patties.],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, Krusty crew, listen up. Last night's buy one get one full price Krabby Patty sale went great! But the crowds left me restaurant dirtier than usual.
,[Squidward rolls his eyes in disgust. Mr. Krabs looks at Squidward and smears a smug of goop off his face.],
,Squidward:, Hey!
,Mr. Krabs:, Eeeh! ,[smears the goop on SpongeBob's face], So I'm gonna need you to clean until this whole place sparkles!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, you've got it, Mr. K.
,[SpongeBob takes out a vacuum, plugs it in his face, and begins sucking up the garbage. He sucks the garbage from two customers, making one look like a handsome millionaire and one a skeleton. Then he sucks the remaining garbage all over the restaurant. He scrubs the cash register clean with a brush. He notices the brush is dirty and scrubs it with the toothbrush. SpongeBob then goes outside, plugs a hose in his head and fills himself up with water. Then, like a outdoor sprinkler, he dances around and sprays water all over the place, making the restaurant sparkly clean inside and out.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, are you all done cleaning?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sprays water in Mr. Krabs' face], Oh, just finishing up now, Mr. Krabs.
,[Mr. Krabs grabs the hose, ties it in a knot and throws it out. The kitchen is now all sparkly clean.],
,Mr. Krabs:, This place looks great! Well done, lad. All right, ,[puts the work hat on SpongeBob's head], time to get back to cooking. ,[notices the grill is missing], Huh? Oh, where's the grill?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I took it outside to air dry. ,[opens the back door], See?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. ,[looks around and sees nothing], See what?
,SpongeBob:, ,[crawls over Mr. Krabs and goes outside], The grill. It's right here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Right here where?
,SpongeBob:, Under my arm, silly.
,Mr. Krabs:, The grill is gone.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], The grill is gone. ,[notices the grill is in fact missing], The grill is gone?! ,[falls down, screams, and runs in panic], The grill is gone! The grill is gone! The grill is gone! The grill is gone! The grill is gone! ,[screams and breathes heavily while Mr. Krabs just stand there and roll his eyes], Grill gone! The grill gone! Oh, look, it must be the grill's trail. ,[licks the sand], There's still some grease flavor here. Come on, Mr. Krabs, I'll taste the trail all the way to the grill.
,Mr. Krabs:, Um, we could just use our eyes, boy-o.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, great idea, Mr. Krabs. ,[walks on his eyeballs],
,[Mr. Krabs groans and follows SpongeBob. SpongeBob follows the trail to an old, abandoned race boat garage. He blinks the sand off his eyes.],
,SpongeBob:, Look, Mr. Krabs, a race boat garage. But what would a garage need a grill for?
,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob go up the window and peak inside.],
,Mr. Krabs:, This ain't no garage. ,[sees four children], This here's a clubhouse for local ragamuffins, urchins, and waifs. ,[sees the grill], Look, and there's me grill.
,SpongeBob:, What are they doing to it, Mr. Krabs?
,[The two twins spray paint all over the grill's sides to look like flames.],
,Boy twin:, Whoa.
,Girl twin:, Cool.
,Boy twin:, Whoa.
,Girl twin:, Whoop.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, no!
,[The smallest kid hammers a wheel on the lower half of the grill.],
,SpongeBob:, Why, why?
,[The chubby kid with a red hat drills a steering wheel on the grill's surface.],
,SpongeBob:, No, not the cooking surface! That's where all the flavor is! ,[cries],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, zip it!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, thanks. ,[zips his pants], You know, not every friend'll tell you when you—
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[clamps SpongeBob's mouth shut], You stay here. I'm gonna get me grill back.
,SpongeBob:, But how, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry, boy-o, they're just kids. They have to listen to me. ,[pulls up his pants and goes inside], Hello, children. I'm an adult. This here is me grill, so I'll just be taking it back now.
,Hat kid:, Hey, what do you think you're doing, mister? That's our racing cart!
,Mr. Krabs:, Racing cart?! That's no ""racing cart."" That there is a top-of-the-line Grill King 3000, and it belongs to me. ,[holds up the documents], See? I brought all the relevant paperwork. ,[gives the documents to the children],
,Hat kid:, This looks more like homework. ,[rips up the document], We don't take kindly to homework around here.
,Boy twin:, Yeah!
,Girl twin:, Homework stinks!
,[The twins rip up the documents too. The smallest kid eats the document and spits it in Mr. Krabs' face.],
,Hat kid:, I think you just wanna steal our racing cart.
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't steal something I already own! ,[groans], That's it! Out of me way, you imps! ,[pushes the hat kid], Grown-up coming through!
,Hat kid:, Hold your sea horses, old man! ,[winks at the small kid],
,[The small kid winks back at the hat kid. The small kid climbs the ladder, holds up a carrot and makes a sea horse spin around. The sea horse activates the drill and pokes a worm underneath, causing it to yelp in pain. The worm pulls on a rope, causing a hammer to remove a nail and forces a plank to hit Mr. Krabs' rear end.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa! Heh, that's it? Your little kiddie trap doesn't—,[gets crushed by two log and the kids laugh],
,[SpongeBob gets in between the logs and separates them.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you okay?
,[Mr. Krabs groans and falls flat on the floor.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[helps Mr. Krabs up], Let me try talking to them, Mr. Krabs. I think I can reach them. After all, I have something you don't: the heart of a child. ,[shows his heart laughing like a baby; he goes over to the kids and looks at the grill], Yeah, not a bad little cart you guys have built.
,Hat kid:, Oh, gee, mister, you think so?
,SpongeBob:, Mm-hmm, too bad it looks slow.
,All four kids:, Huh?!
,SpongeBob:, Yep, no way this thing could beat our cart, not in a million years. ,[spins the steering wheel],
,Hat kid:, Our cart is the fastest in Bikini Bottom!
,Both twins:, The fastest!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, really? If only there was some way to prove it.
,Hat kid:, How's about a race, then?
,SpongeBob:, How's about the winner of the race gets to keep the loser's racing cart?
,Hat kid:, How's about it's on? See you tomorrow morning at the top of Murder Hill. ,[leaves with the other kids],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs SpongeBob by his nose], What do you think you're doing, boy-o? We don't have a racing cart!
,SpongeBob:, Of course we do, Mr. Krabs. There's just some assembly required.
,[Mr. Krabs lets SpongeBob go.],
,French Narrator:, Zee Next Morning...
,[The scene changes to the next morning. Thunder claps around the sign that reads, ""Murder Hill."" SpongeBob pulls the racing cart he and Mr. Krabs made. It consists of two tables, a worn-our driver's seat, the cash register for the steering wheel and the register boat for the cart.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You sure we built this thing right? It looks a little funky.
,SpongeBob:, Well, what do you mean? ,[holds up the blueprint], We followed my blueprint. ,[the table in SpongeBob's blueprint falls off], Besides, there's nothing to worry about. We just have to make it through one quick race down this teensy weensy little ,[stretches himself as he looks down the hill], deadly, steep, utterly terrifying hill! ,[gasps],
,[As he looks down the hill, he sees a couple of boats driving, some erupting volcanoes, flying dinosaurs, and deadly traps near the finish line. SpongeBob gulps nervously and the four kids arrive with the grill. The kids laugh at SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs' cart.],
,Hat kid:, Ha! You call that a racing cart? Looks more like the slow boat to Palookaville.
,[The kids laugh obnoxiously.],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's on, you whippersnappers! ,[grabs SpongeBob and hops into the cart; he then notices Plankton in a cart of his own], Plankton, what are you doing here?
,Plankton:, When I heard your grill was on the line, I had to get in on this race. If there's even one little smudge of patty on there, the formula will be mine. ,[activates the spikes on his cart],
,[The worm from the race cart garage holds up the racing flag. The kids, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton growl at each other. The worm waves the flag and the race begins. But before it does, Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the track, sending him flying and crashing into a rock.],
,Plankton:, Barnacles!
,[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and the kids go down the hill. Mr. Krabs and the hat kid stare and growl at each other. The contestants drive all the way down the hill until they reach the streets of Bikini Bottom, running over several people in the process. They even run into Bubble Bass and cause him to lose his Krabby Patty. The twins hold up two bags of marbles and throw them in Mr. Krabs' eye.],
,Boy twin:, Ha, ha, take that!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shakes the marble off], Watch it, you hooligan!
,[The twins throw more marbles at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs attempts to smash into the kids, but ends up getting his eyestalks grabbed and strangled by them.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, look out!
,[The kids, Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob are heading straight to an incoming intersection. SpongeBob skids his foot to slow the cart down, but ends up burning his foot. The kids, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs crash into the intersection, causing a major pile up. One boat hits Mr. Krabs' eyestalks and send it flying into the pile up, causing it to fall over. The smallest kid comes out from the grill's oven, takes out a pair of pliers and clips the front wheel off of SpongeBob's cart.],
,All four kids:, Ha, ha!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, the steering's out! They cut our brakes! What do we do?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, oh, uh, maybe we should call their parents?
,SpongeBob:, No, Mr. Krabs! You can't win a kid's game by thinking like an adult! You have to think young. ,[shows himself as an innocent child],
,Mr. Krabs:, You're right, boy-o. We have to delve deep back into me childhood! ,[takes out a teddy bear, curls up in a fetal position, sucks his thumb and cries like a baby],
,SpongeBob:, Too far back, Mr. Krabs! Too far!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[snaps out of it], Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Check this out. ,[hops to the back], I learned it in me old Wormtown skating days! ,[leans the cart back and skates like a skateboard],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, Mr. Krabs, I didn't know you could shred.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sees the ""Plug and Such"" store], Whoo, hey. ,[gets an idea], I got a plan! Hold on!
,[Mr. Krabs swerves the cart into the plug store and grabs a really long plug. Then they catch up to the four kids and the grill.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Plug 'em in, boy-o!
,[SpongeBob takes the plug and goes to plug it in the back of the grill. But every attempt makes him miss the outlet.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, SpongeBob! What's the holdup?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. Krabs. My hands get clammy when I'm defying death. ,[reveals a clam in his hand], See? ♪Ta-da!♪ ,[laughs as he lets the clam goes and flies in between Mr. Krabs' eyes],
,Mr. Krabs:, Enough magic tricks! Plug 'em in!
,[SpongeBob finally plugs the grill.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah!
,[All of the sudden, the grill's surface begins to light up. It causes the hat kid's bottom and the twin's feet to burn. They hop up and down in pain until the plug stops the grill and sends the four kids flying off. They land on the ground and the smallest kid comes out in a pie.],
,SpongeBob:, Yay, the finish line!
,[Plankton crawls up to the finish line, but gets crushed by SpongeBob's cart. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs cross the finish line, but they end up crashing into a pole and getting themselves hurt.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shudders], I won.
,[The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are covered in bandages in order to recuperate. SpongeBob happily flips the patties on the grill and hugs it now that he's happy that he got it back. Mr. Krabs is in the dining room talking to some grown-ups about their adventure.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And so after some quick thinking and fancy racerin', I won me grill back. I looked at those kids in the eye and said, ""I own these streets. Don't ever come back to me restaurant ever again...Until you have money."" Adults rule!
,[Mr. Krabs and the grown-ups laugh. Suddenly, they hear a loud crash outside.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, what's going on?
,[It was the four obnoxious kids again. This time, they're using the whole restaurant as a racing cart instead.],
,Hat kid:, Whoa, let's see 'em beat us this time. ,[whistles],
,[The twins and the small kid push the restaurant forward and hop on.],
,SpongeBob:, Here we go cart again! ,[laughs as the restaurant begins to drive away],
,Mr. Krabs:, Zip it, boy-o.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, thanks, Mr. Krabs. Not everybody'll tell you when—,[gets cut off as the restaurant drives down the road],

"[Transitions outside where a magnet is dragged on the ground. Camera zooms out to reveal Mr. Krabs wearing a safari cap],
,Mr. Krabs:, What better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change. ,[Then something tugs on Mr. Krabs' magnet], Whooh! ,[Mr. Krabs pulls and a giant pile of sand hangs from his magnet], There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there! ,[The sand falls, only to reveal a second magnet. He then gets upset], I knew this place looked familiar. [,Startles in surprise], What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look. ,[He rings the door bell on Sandy's treedome and Sandy opens it in her air suit], Good afternoon, Miss Sandy.
,Sandy:, And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome. ,[chuckles], I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year.
,Sandy:, Sure, lets get you fitted with a helmet.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't bother yourself. As long as I keep me ole lungs moist, I can breath your fancy air all day long.
,Sandy:, Come on in then. ,[they go inside the treedome],
,[Scene cuts to the interior of the treedome],
,Mr. Krabs:, Seems so much bigger once your inside.
,Sandy:, That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually...
,Sandy:, ,[walks over to her table and holds up a device that looks like a cube puzzle], Or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multi-colored cubeshaped puzzle. See it can solve itself. ,[Zooms in to reveal that the Cube puzzle matches with the shapes on it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh Sandy, actually I'm not interested in all of that.
,Sandy:, Okay, well was there something particular you wanted to see?
,Mr. Krabs:, Tell me about your giant soybean.
,[Scene cuts to Sandy and Mr. Krabs with the giant soybean plant],
,Sandy:, This is the result of an experimental growth serum I develop. It could easily feed a lot of hungry people.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Or a supply of entire rest---. ,[Counting on his calculator and mumbling to himself],
,Sandy:, Once the testing is complete, the growth serum could be used to do a lot of good things.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps],
,Sandy:, Sure would hate to see it fallen into the wrong hands. Someone who might just use it to try and get-
,Mr. Krabs:, Rich! I'll be rich!
,Sandy:, What's that, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, could I borrow your telephone? ,[dials the telephone and it starts ringing], Heh, it's ringing.
,SpongeBob:, ,[suddenly runs into the scene], Mr. Krabs, I came as soon as I got the call!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[puts the phone back in], Uh, did you bring a Krabby Patty like I was planning to ask you to do?
,SpongeBob:, ,[brings out a Krabby Patty], Aye aye, captain.
,Mr. Krabs:, Perfect! Okay Sandy, administer the growth serum.
,Sandy:, I don't know, Mr. Krabs. I can't predict what's going to happen.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you did say it needs further testing. Test it on the Krabby Patty.
,Sandy:, Well, I suppose so. But only a single drop.
,Mr. Krabs:, Fair enough. ,[Sandy puts a drop of growth serum onto the Krabby Patty], Is it suppose to smell like that?
,Sandy:, If you two will excuse me, I need to pay a quick visit to a little squirrel's room. ,[hands Mr. Krabs the growth serum before leaving the scene], Would you mind holding these while I'm gone? I'll only be a minute.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looks at the growth serum], Oh no, we don't mind. ,[dumps the whole beaker onto the Krabby Patty], Heh heh heh, there.
,SpongeBob:, But Sandy said-
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[closes SpongeBob's mouth], Sh sh sh sh sh sh sh. ,[He and SpongeBob goes to Sandy's door], Thanks for the tour, Sandy, see you later! ,[leaving Sandy's treedome and the camera zooms in on the empty growth serum beaker],
,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walking],
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, that patty didn't look like it's growing to me. Pfft, growth serum. Waste of a perfectly Krabby Patty.
,[Krabby Patty suddenly grows on SpongeBob's hands],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Great, let's get into the Krusty Krab.
,[Krabby Patty grows even bigger. SpongeBob struggles to carry it],
,SpongeBob:, Patty... becoming... awkward...
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, here, here. ,[Brings out a grocery bag], Put it in this grocery bag.
,SpongeBob:, Grocery bag? Where'd you get a grocery bag?
,Mr. Krabs:, The grocery store.
,[Scene cuts to the inside of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is at his post. SpongeBob comes by carrying the big Krabby Patty, trying to keep it balanced. Squidward stares at SpongeBob as he goes to the kitchen. The patty is now on the table. Mr. Krabs comes in as the Krabby Patty grows even bigger. The patty appears to be pulsing.],
,SpongeBob:, So, uh, how big's this thing suppose to get?
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh heh, who cares. It's an endless supply of free patties! And cook them fast, boy! ,[walks out the door], We got customers!
,Squidward:, ,[comes in from his post with an order], SpongeBob! Are you going to cook that thing or just stand there staring at it? ,[throws the order],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward. Coming right up! ,[runs to the stove while grabbing the order], Order up, Squidward! ,[carrying a plate of piled up Krabby Patties],
,Squidward:, All right, keep them coming! ,[grabs the Krabby Patties],
,SpongeBob:, You betcha! ,[takes a scrap of patties from the big patty and puts them on the stove. SpongeBob flips one of them as the big Krabby Patty grows even bigger behind SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Oh my goodness! I almost forgot to flip that one. ,[points to a Krabby Patty and flips it], There we go. ,[brings out another pile of Krabby Patties and the giant Krabby Patty bumps Squidward's head.],
,Squidward:, Ok, that's great SpongeBob, but you don't have to knock me in the-  BAGEGAH! ,[sees at the Krabby patty growing behind SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, why did you make that weird noi- ,[he looks at the Patty and screams as it comes alive], Ahh! Easy boy. Easy. Never thought I'd say this but, I've gotta get out of this kitchen! ,[SpongeBob runs to the exit, but sees the grill eaten up], Nooooooo! Huh? ,[SpongeBob stares down as the Krabby Patty advances to his shoe. SpongeBob fights it off with his spatuala, but that gets eaten. SpongeBob screams then desperately yanks off his left shoe and sock, while the patty eats that up.], Squidward! That giant Krabby Patty is on a rampage! We have to escape!
,Squidward:, ,[sees SpongeBob's bare foot], Do you always go barefoot at work, or have I just never noticed before?
,SpongeBob:, ,[pointing to his bare foot], Wouldn't this just count as half-barefoot? Squidward, behind you! ,[SpongeBob points to the growing patty, now destroying the Krusty Krab], Abandon ship! ,[Squidward screams as he and SpongeBob both flee],
,Fish::, ,[everyone runs out of the Krusty Krab], It's a Krabalanche! ,[SpongeBob and Squidward try to exit, but Mr. Krabs blocks their way.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold it! And just what is it you two think you're doing?
,Squidward:, The restaurant's being invaded by a 300 foot uncooked menu item. We're getting outta here!
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa ho, this is a dream come true! You can't just leave!
,Squidward:, Oh, do you have a better idea?
,Mr. Krabs:, Stay?... And work?
,Squidward:, Okay, you go right ahead. But I'd rather stay alive than stay at work. That means you- ,[Squidward turns to see the cash register getting eaten by the Krabby Patty],
,Mr. Krabs:, Cashy! ,[Mr. Krabs runs over to the register],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, look out!
,Mr. Krabs:, Aaah! ,[Mr. Krabs is eaten by the Krabby Patty, which then proceeds to eat a table, a barrel chair, and a column],
,Squidward:, ,[To SpongeBob] ,I think it's our break time, don't you? ,[SpongeBob and Squidward run out of the Krusty Krab, screaming. The patty eats the Krusty Krab whole and chases them.],
,Plankton:, ,[watching the scene from the rooftop of the Chum Bucket with a telescope] ,What's this? ,[puts down the telescope], Krabs is cooking up some new scheme to undermine the success of his biggest competitor? ME?! ,[folds the telescope] ,Ah, I'd better get a closer look. ,[exits the Chum Bucket],  ,[SpongeBob and Squidward are still running], Out of my way, you fools!
,SpongeBob:, ,[skids to a stop, while Squidward keeps running], Plankton, you're going the wrong way! Turn back or be crushed by a giant monster!
,Plankton:, ,[keeps running], I can't hear you! I need to see this! ,[Plankton skids and falls backwards], Holy mother of all creatures great and small! ,[The patty gets closer], It's the largest Krabby Patty the world has ever seen! It's... it's... gorgeous... ,[Plankton runs over to the patty], Oh, great patty! Take me! Take me home, daddy! ,[jumps into the patty],
,Dale:, ,[The Bikini Bottom citizens see the patty and start running away], Keep running, it's getting closer!
,Fish:, No, it isn't! Look! Where I'm pointing! It stopped!
,Dale:, ,[They stop running and look] ,Hey! He's right! ,[The giant patty is actually stopping for a stoplight. It turns green and the patty starts moving again. The fish run away],
,[Police officer tickets a car, only for it to be swallowed by the giant patty],
,[The giant patty then proceeds to eat the entire town],
,Lady in Teal:, Snookums! Look out! ,[pulls the pet worm away from the patty], You've got to promise mommy you'll be more careful! Neptune knows what he'd do if you were swallowed by the putrid ooze that's running rapid in our streets. ,[gets swallowed by Krabby Patty],
,[Scene changes to SpongeBob seeing Gary sleeping at SpongeBob's home],
,SpongeBob:, Gary! Gary wake up! Pack up your stuff! Our house is about to be knocked over by a giant Krabby Patty!
,[Gary yawns and goes back to sleep],
,[SpongeBob takes Gary and runs screaming out of his house, which then gets eaten by the giant krabby patty; SpongeBob runs to Patrick's house and opens the rock],
,SpongeBob:, Wake up Patrick! We gotta get out of here!
,Patrick:, Huh...oh hi, SpongeBob. I just had the strangest dream, I was being chased by a giant Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, That wasn't a dream!
,[The two run screaming away from the rock, which ends up being swallowed by the Giant Krabby Patty],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! What do we do?
,SpongeBob:, We'll find Sandy, she'll know what to do!
,[They run to Sandy's house which is broken with the dome shattered to bits],
,Patrick:, I don't think she's home, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, She has to be, this is her treedome! Sandy, where are you?
,Sandy:, SpongeBob?
,[SpongeBob opens up a toilet next to him, thinking Sandy is in it.],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy?
,Sandy:, No, SpongeBob! Up here! ,[waves to SpongeBob from helicopter], And hurry! I'm running out of coconut milk!
,[Cues to SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, and Sandy in the helicopter],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, what happened to your treedome?
,Sandy:, Well, that giant soybean got too big, so I chopped it up into a giant salad. Anyone got any giant croutons?
,Patrick:, ...I think I'm gonna be sick.
,SpongeBob:, What's wrong, Patrick? Airsickness?
,Patrick:, No...the thought of a salad that size is more than I can handle.
,Sandy:, And now that I've mastered the soy bean, I can master that patty.
,SpongeBob:, Really? How?
,Sandy:, The puzzle cube told me. The key to defeating the patty is you, SpongeBob! All I have to do is get you closer to the patty so that you can make direct contact.
,SpongeBob:, Direct contact!? Are you sure?
,Sandy:, The puzzle cube never lies.
,[The Giant Krabby Patty is now in sight],
,Sandy:, Alright, we have visual. Putting you into position, SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob climbs down via a ladder],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, bye. ,[Ladder is hoisted back up],
,SpongeBob:, Well giant patty, I guess it's just you and me. Wait, what was I supposed to do again?
,Sandy:, Just make direct contact!
,SpongeBob:, Direct contact, you mean like this? 
,[SpongeBob touches the giant patty with his finger. He then absorbs it],
,Sandy:, It's working! Keep going! You can do it!
,SpongeBob:, Body filling with Krabby Patty. Enormous strain.
,[Krabby Patty spits out buildings],
,SpongeBob:, Never absorbed this much Krabby Patty into my body before! In fact, I've never absorbed any Krabby Patties into my body, come to think of it!
,[,He entirely absorbs it. The buildings and people in Bikini Bottom are freed. SpongeBob is now huge and Krabby Patty colored],
,SpongeBob:, Ok...what do I do now?
,[Scene changes to Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is on a box announcing the new Pre-Absorbed Patties via SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Step right up folks! For a limited time, free absorbed Krabby Patties!
,[Squidward opens the cash register; he proceeds to talk into a walkie-talkie],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! Two! Medium-rare!
,SpongeBob:, ,[also talking into walkie-talkie], Copy that. Over.
,[SpongeBob, still in Krabby Patty form, proceeds to make the Krabby Patties with drips of Krabby Patties from his finger],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's it! Don't crowd! While supplies last, don't be shy! Come on!
,[Two Krabby Patty meats drop to the grill],

"[episode begins at Krusty Krab with SpongeBob in the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Order up! ,[rings bell 3 times],
,Mr. Krabs:, How's it looking out there, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K.
,Mr. Krabs:, I ain't interested in same old regulars, SpongeBob! So I took out an ad in the Bikini Bottom Examiner to bring in some new customers! Twas a bargain too. ,[SpongeBob takes a magnifying glass and looks at it], Only cost me a nickel. So tell me now, boy. How many new customers we got out there so far?
,SpongeBob:, Oooh, let me see there was... none.
,Mr. Krabs:, What? What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper? ,[walks outside to the newspaper carriers, blows on one], Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months. ,[notices the other one, and there is a long line], While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?
,Nat:, Ha! Nobody reads the Examiner, bud. It's all full of boring charts and facts! ,[opens newspaper door], The Bottomfeeder's where it's at! It's got like interesting stories and stuff.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[reading the newspaper], ""Fishboy Strikes Again?"" ,[not reading], Wait a minute, aren't these stories a little less than truthful?
,Nat:, I don't know. But they're selling!

,Mr. Krabs:, No, thank you. ,[closes newspaper door], Now let's see how much they charge for advertising. ,[screams], 25¢ per word! The newspaper business sure is easy money! ,[Mr. Krab's shell cracks and underneath it is his body, but in money form], That gives me an idea! ,[The money falls out of place. Scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab as SpongeBob walks in.],
,SpongeBob:, What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy?
,Squidward:, Yep, what another wonderful hum-drum day slinging burgers. ,[SpongeBob walks into the kitchen, but hits his face on something.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Off of your duff, boy. You think I spent all last night assembling this printing press, so you could laze around all day? From now on you'll be twice as busy. And I expect you to wear 2 hats. 'Cause along with your usual fry cooking duties, you're my new lead reporter for the new ,Krabby Kronicle,! ,[A press badge on SpongeBob is shown],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! My very own press badge!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right, boy! And here's your very own camera! So you'll need it to document all them juicy stories you're gonna write. Now what are you waiting for, boy? ,[cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street],
,SpongeBob:, On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look. ,[there is a bank robbery going on, two tough fish destroying someone's boat with fire in the background, and a monster], No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for! ,[takes a picture of Patrick], Patrick Star, I'm scoop SquarePants from the ,Krabby Kronicle,. Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today?
,Patrick:, Oh, I'm not taking a bus, SpongeBob. I am watching this pole. So the next time it moves, I will see it!
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, this story is juicy! ,[cuts to the Krusty Krab where there is a sign that says ""The KRABBY KRONICLE"" on it. SpongeBob is writing on the typewriter, then puts it in a pile of papers, then finished the headline for the paper, then puts it in the printing press. Mr. Krabs walks in],
,Mr. Krabs:, What a money-tastical day! Eh, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Yeah, I'm just breaking it in.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm excited about all the newspaper sales, too.
,Squidward:, We haven't sold any papers today. ,[as SpongeBob drives a wheelbarrow of newspapers],
,Mr. Krabs:, What do you mean we haven't sold any newspapers? Certainly this gentlemen would like a copy of the ,Krabby Kronicle,.
,Frank:, Looks boring. Can I just have a Krabby Patty?
,Mr. Krabs:, Too boring? ,[looks at paper], SpongeBob! ,[The KRABBY KRONICLE sign on the Krusty Krab shakes], What's the meaning of this?
,SpongeBob:, Meaning of what, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ""Local Resident Watches Pole?"" No one's gonna pay to read this malarkey! When you write these stories, you've gotta use a little imagination, boy.
,SpongeBob:, Imagination!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah. Maybe instead of ""Man Watches Pole,"" you could say something like... oh... ""Man Marries Pole."" Then you can alter the photo a little to fit the headline and, see? ,[Mr. Krabs modified it to look like what he said], Now that's a juicy story!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, isn't that lying?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't think of it as lying, boy. Think of it as... uh... a practical joke. You know. Something everybody can have a good laugh about. The public expects a little embellishment here and there, so I want you to go out there, and get me a lead story that'll sell! ,[cuts to an intersection, and SpongeBob is hiding behind a trash can. Mrs. Puff pulls up, and then a policeman pulls up behind here. SpongeBob takes a picture, and both of them look around],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Mrs. Puff is going to laugh her hat off when she reads this! ,[cuts to a newspaper that says ""Boating Teacher in High Speed Chase""],
,Mr. Krabs:, ""Boating Teacher in High Speed Chase!"" I think you finally done it, boy! You've given me a story that'll sell! And sell it has! ,[everyone has a copy of the newspaper, and Squidward hands Harold a copy],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but that isn't the story I wrote.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's called editorial privilege, son. It gives you that extra oomph to move units. Besides, how could such a little news story, possibly affect Mrs. Puff in any way? ,[cuts to Mrs. Puff's Boating School],
,Mrs. Puff:, I can't believe such a little news story could have ruined my business! ,[cuts to SpongeBob hiding in a chimney, looking through binoculars],
,SpongeBob:, Let's see what there is to see. Wait a minute. Larry the Lobster. Hmm, wonder what kind of dirt he has under those muscles. ,[goes in the chimney, then hides behind a dumpster], Uh-huh, this looks shady, very shady. ,[Larry walks up to Frankie],
,Frankie:, Larry, hey, tough guy? Can I punch you in the gut?
,Larry:, Sure. Everybody does. It won't hurt me a bit. ,[Frankie punches him, and SpongeBob takes a picture, then one of him putting his arms on his chest, then Larry laughs], Told you it wouldn't hurt.
,Frankie:, Thanks, big guy.
,Larry:, See ya' round.
,SpongeBob:, ,[writes on paper], Very interesting... ,[cuts to a gym, and the teacher is pushing Larry out],
,Gym Teacher:, Out! Out! Out!
,Larry:, Hey, what's the big idea?
,Gym Teacher:, This! ,[hand him the newspaper],
,Larry:, ,[reading], ""Larry the Loser Gets Beaten Up by Pipsqueak?"" ,[tries to explain to his teacher], But, but, but...
,Gym Teacher:, [rudely says] No buts! I can't have a wimp like you destroying my gym's reputation! You're banned forever! ,[throws him out, then SpongeBob walks up],
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Larry.
,Larry:, Not now, SpongeBob. Let me take in the fact that my life is ruined!
,SpongeBob:, Ruined? What are you talking about?
,Larry:, These lies someone wrote about me. ,[shows him the paper, and SpongeBob gasps. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks for your business, and here's your paper. ,[hands fish the paper],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, can I have a word with you?
,Mr. Krabs:, Make it quick, boy. These papers are selling faster then we can print 'em!
,SpongeBob:, That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, they're certainly doing me some good. ,[shows him his office, where there is a lot of money], Can you believe it? Look at all this loot! ,[sits in a pile of money],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but isn't there a way we could write juicy stories without hurting people?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, you just don't get it, do you boy? We're not hurting anyone. We're just making their lives interesting, for everybody else. ,[pushes SpongeBob out], Now get out there, and fetch another story! ,[cuts to the Chum Bucket, and Plankton walks out of the kitchen with a Chum Stick],
,Plankton:, Oh, Karen! I think this is it! The Chum Stick that's finally gonna drive Krabs out of business!
,Health Inspector:, I think not. I'm Health Inspector Yellowtail. I'm officially closing down your restaurant.
,Plankton:, Why? I haven't done anything.
,Health Inspector:, ,[flatly chuckling], That's not what ,this, says. ,[shows Plankton the paper],
,Plankton:, ,[reading], ""Plankton's Chum Made of Your Chums? The Chum Bucket serves your friends in more ways than one?"" ,[not reading], What?! ,[The Health inspector locks down the Chum Bucket], Who's to blame for this? Who?!? ,[SpongeBob is watching, and then walks away, scene then cuts to a long line, and Mr. Krabs is in his office with more money],
,Mr. Krabs:, You're reaching new levels of imagination, boy-o!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I... I know.
,Mr. Krabs:, What's wrong. boy? You sick or something?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mr. Krabs, you could say that.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't be silly, boy! We're a success!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, we're hurting people!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, baloney! You better start feeling right! 'Cause if you don't, you can just kiss your spatular goodbye!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you wouldn't!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, darn tootin' I would! Now get out there, and bring me a juicy one!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Aye-aye, sir. ,[cuts to Sandy picking acorns, and is about to eat one, then she notices two fish carrying a box with awards in it],
,Sandy:, Sorry, fellars, this is a private treedome.
,Dennis:, I had no idea it talked. Don't worry, we're from the Neptunian Science Committee, and we've come to confiscate all your science awards. Haven't you read today's headlines? ,[holds up newspaper],
,Sally:, It can't even read. Why are you—?
,Sandy:, Oh, gimme that! ,[reading], ""Sandy Cheeks or Sandy Chump? Bushy tailed brainiac really a slow-witted squirrel, by... SpongeBob SquarePants?"" ,[throws the paper down], That yellow sidewinder thinks he can do that to me?!
,Dennis:, Oh boy... We better scram! The dumb ones are always the most violent! ,[the two scientists run away while Sandy is growling, the scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where there is a huge line, and a sign that says over 5 billion copies sold, and Mr. Krabs has even more money, and is in his office with SpongeBob, and is laughing],
,Mr. Krabs:, You've really outdone yourself this time! ,[his eyes water up, SpongeBob absorbs it, and Mr. Krabs squeezes it out],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I can't write these stories anymore.
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, that's a bunch of hooey!
,SpongeBob:, I've seen people's lives ruined, with my own eyes!
,Mr. Krabs:, People want wild juicy stories! That's what sells! Now I want your little yellow noggin, to come up with the wildest story ever! One that'll top all the others!
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Mr. Krabs, I've written about everybody in town. Any ideas, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, Surprise me! Give me a shocker! ,[throws him in his chair], Good night boy. I'll check on you tomorrow morning. And remember, the wildest story ever! ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, the wildest story ever, huh? ,[starts writing/typing, then cuts to the next day where the paper's are being printed, and Mr. Krabs runs in],
,Mr. Krabs:, How's it going, lad? ,[SpongeBob turns around, and he is very tired],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh-ahh, it's a surprise.
,Mr. Krabs:, Excellent! We're gonna sell out in no time! We'll have to do another printing. ,[runs outside, and there is an angry mob], Huh?

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[reading], ""Krabs Overworks Employees? Reaps Reward? Krabby Kronicle mastermind behind bogus stories pays his tired, under-age reporter pennies while he rakes in the dough?!""
,Martha:, How could you do that to such an innocent child?! This is sick and inhumane!
,Sandy:, Not to mention the fact that he's written lies about us!
,Plankton:, I lost my restaurant because of you! And I thought ,I, was evil...
,Larry:, All the kids in town want to beat me up for lunch money! ,[cries],
,Mrs. Puff:, And I've had to go back to watching... ,[starts to cry], daytime television!
,Martha:, Oh, that's it! We're taking our money back! ,[everyone runs in, and takes bags of money while leaving a trail of destruction],
,Mr. Krabs:, No! ,[screams and starts to cry],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, are you okay?
,Mr. Krabs:, How can I be okay when me money's gone?! All gone! ,[cries then sighs], It just goes to show, trying to make an easy buck doesn't pay. ,[notices the printing press], Or does it? ,[puts a dollar in the printing press, and turns it on, which makes sheets of paper with just pictures of money], Get me some scissors, boy-o!

,Tony Jr.:, Thanks! Lived here all my life! My mom and dad are out.
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Uh, what does that mean?
,Tony Jr.:, It means... you wanna see my dad's vintage speedboat collection?
,SpongeBob:, Oh would I?
,[cuts to Tony Fast's gararge showing many speedboats],
,Tony Jr.:, And he took first place in this beauty surpassing speed records held by both Francis Baconskin Jr. and Smitty Tailpipe Rockama!
,SpongeBob:, Wow! They're so shiny!
,Tony Jr.:, Pick your favorite!
,SpongeBob:, My favorite? Oh I couldn't!
,Tony Jr.:, Why sure you can! What's the big-
,SpongeBob:, ,[Points to a red speedboat with flames on the front and with the number 8 on it], This one!
,Tony Jr.:, Huh? The Batonia Classic! Excellent choice! ,[Grabs the keys to the Batonia Classic], Want to take her for a spin?
,SpongeBob:, A spin? But we don't even have boating licenses!
,Tony Jr.:, ,[In the speedboat], You don't need a boating license for a raceboat SquarePants!
,[Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the Batonia Classic],
,SpongeBob:, Wow Tony Jr.! She handles like a dream! It's like I'm floating air!
,Tony Jr.:, ,[On a hanglider flying as a rope is keeping him tied to the speedboat], You're telling me!
,SpongeBob:, Are you sure you're comfortable with me driving, though? I admit I'm feeling a little nervous...
,Tony Jr.:, I wouldn't if I were you! Remember it was your nerves that made us almost crash before!
,SpongeBob:, Hah... my nerves! I almost forgot about... my nerves! ,[Starts driving nervously almost running over a fish], Sorry sir!
,Tony Jr.:, Just let go! ,[lets go of the hanglider but grabs back onto it], Phew...
,SpongeBob:, Let go... got it! ,[Lets go of the steering wheel and drives around a curve], Whee!
,Tony Jr.:, Go faster, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Faster?
,Tony Jr.:, Just let go! Of the brakes!
,SpongeBob:, Eh... if you say so! ,[Sticks up  his foot higher letting go of the brake and going even faster around more curves], Whee! ,[Goes down the street], Whee! ,[Goes over a loop], Whee!
,Tony Jr:, Now you're getting it!
,SpongeBob:, Whee... red light! ,[Notices the light turn red],
,Tony Jr:, Ah!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Instantly stops the boat],
,Tony Jr:, Real cool SquarePants... ,[Now beside SpongeBob in the boat],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks TFJ...,[Notices three fish in another speedboat beside them],
,Street Racer:, That's quite a fancy speed boat you got right there! For a couple of squares!
,Female Passenger:, What he said! ,[All three laugh],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you! And may I say how lovely your speed boat is, too! For a bunch of circles! And by circles, I mean well-rounded individuals! Ah ha ha ha!
,Street Racer:, Well wise guy eh? Well then, how about you wise up to an unfriendly competition? Right here, right now!
,Female Passenger:, Yeah! What he said!
,SpongeBob:, Right here, right now? A little short notice... ,[Takes out a small book], let me check my availability. ,[Looks in the book], Let's see... Right now... Looks like I don't have anything scheduled for right now. Therefore, I would like to accept your challenge!
,Tony Jr:, Yes!
,SpongeBob:, However! Certain safety concerns prevent me from doing so! Therefore, I must decline!
,Tony Jr:, SquarePants! I can't believe what I'm hearing here!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Tries to listen for something], I don't hear anything...
,Tony Jr:, ,[Face-palm], Ah... Look kid! Being cool includes accepting this challenge! Anything less would be an embarrassment!
,SpongeBob:, I would never want to embarrass you Tony Jr. Therefore, I accept your challenge!
,Street Racer:, Oh it's on!
,Female Passenger:, What he said!
,Street Racer:, Do you mind?
,[Both racers get ready as the red light changes to green and they both take off through the town. They pass fish in which they rip their clothes off and onto another. SpongeBob starts to get the lead.],
,Street Racer:, Huh? ,[Speeds up passed SpongeBob and Tony Jr],Hah hah!
,Female Passenger:, What he said!
,SpongeBob:, Grr... Grr! ,[Presses down harder on the gas pedal which starts to catch in flames as he speeds passed Larry the Lobster burning him],
,Larry:, Sweet! Instant tannage!
,[SpongeBob catches up to the Male Race Driver as they continue to drive beside each other],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Growls], Grr!
,Street Racer:, ,[Laughs until the Female Passenger points out to him, his eyes go through his glasses as there is a sign saying ""Click It or Ticket"" with police near by. He goes quick, and then slows down],
,SpongeBob:, We're winning! We're winning!
,[SpongeBob and Tony Jr. laugh as they speed passed the police car],
,Policeman 1:, Whoa! Did you see that?
,Policeman 2:, That guy wasn't just going fast...
,Both:, ...He was going Tony Fast!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Notices the police car], Huh? Oh no! The cops are after us! What are we going to do?
,Tony Jr:, What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over that siren.
,[A police helicopter now follows them],
,SpongeBob:, Now there's a helicopter after us!
,Tony Jr:, What's that? I couldn't hear you over that helicopter!
,[Tony Fast is in his speedboat listening to the news on his radio],
,Newsman:, And in other news, son of racing legend, Tony Fast is currently involved in a high speed chase, it is rumored that the...
,[SpongeBob and Tony Jr. drive passed Tony Fast with the police car and police helicopter still following them],
,Tony Fast:, What the?
,SpongeBob:, What're we going to do!? ,[notices Tony Fast in the mirror chasing them],
,Tony Fast:, Tony Jr! When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna-
,SpongeBob:, Now your dad is after us!
,Tony Jr:, Sorry I couldn't hear you, my... my... My dad is after us! What're we gonna do?!
,SpongeBob:, How should I know? He's your dad!
,Tony Jr:, Well just remember my advice, okay? All you got to do is let go... be cool... let go... be cool...
,SpongeBob:, ,[annoyed], Do you see where letting go has gotten us so far? Huh, Tony Jr? ,[pants heavily],
,Tony Jr:, No, but I see where it's getting us next!
,SpongeBob:, ,[notices quickly], ,[screams], ,[drives through the sign of Mrs. Puff's Boating School and ends up on Mrs. Puff as she inflates],
,[Cuts to the inside of the classroom],
,Mrs. Puff:, Well class, I regret to inform you that Tony Jr. is no longer with us...
,Crowd:, Gasp!
,Mrs. Puff:, He was transferred to another school. However, I would think that Tony Jr. taught us all a valuable lesson...
,SpongeBob:, ,[On a hospital bed], Oh! Oh! Oh! Never argue and drive?
,Mrs. Puff:, Close... the lesson is: Never let you drive!

"[The episode begins on a dark and spooky, Halloween night. Jellyfishes fly out of an old, sunken ship with bat-wigs and fly towards Bikini Bottom. In the city, trick-or-treaters are walking in the streets with costumes and everyone is having a great time.],
,Trick-Or-Treater 1:, I wanted to be Mermaid Man this year.
,Trick-Or-Treater 2:, Trick or treat.
,[On a rooftop of a building, one citizen is putting a ghost-shaped balloon on the roof.],
,Citizen:, I love Halloween. ,[gets zapped by the jellyfish], Whoa! ,[falls off the roof],
,[The jellyfish fly over to SpongeBob's house, where SpongeBob is putting up decorations for Halloween.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah! ,[takes out glitter from his pocket and blows it on the banner], Hm... Mm-hm. It's scary, but... ,[adds more glitter on the house until it is sparkly; then he cuts the banner in half, making it look like the word, ""Hallo""; just then, the jellyfish fly over to SpongeBob.], Oh. Hello. ,[pulls out a Halloween cookie and laughs; the jellyfish eat the cookie and they zap him; SpongeBob screams; the jellyfish leave and SpongeBob waves goodbye; then he slides down the ladder to take a look at his house], Hm...
,[At that same moment, Patrick, who is wearing a knight costume, comes by.],
,Patrick:, Hello!
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Sir Patrick. How do you like my decorations?
,[Patrick flips open his helmet to look at SpongeBob's house.],
,Patrick:, Those are too cute for Halloween, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick, Halloween is cute. Sharing candy, holding hands, singing songs. It's a bright and cheery time of year.
,Patrick:, I thought it was about getting your pants scared off. Hey, where's your costume?
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Close your eyes. ,[Patrick closes his helmet and SpongeBob turns around to put on his costume], Okay. Open 'em. ,[Patrick peeks his eyes through his helmet and sees that SpongeBob's costume is literally a flower], ♪I'm a lovely flower♪ Ooh...
,Patrick:, Oh, that's not scary either, SpongeBob. Wait, I'll show you what scary is. ,[picks up SpongeBob and carries him to Squidward's house while SpongeBob laughs],
,Trick-Or-Treaters:, Let's go to this house.
,[The trick or treaters walk up to Squidward's house.],
,Squidward:, ,[spectrally], Oh... There is no candy here...
,Trick-Or-Treater 3:, What?
,Squidward:, Only onions! ,[rolls onions out of his house], Now move along. Ooh...
,[The trick-or-treaters flee from Squidward's house.],
,Patrick:, No candy. That is so scary. Right, SpongeBob? SpongeBob? ,[Patrick feels a rattling motion in his costume; he opens it and finds SpongeBob hiding in it], SpongeBob, why are you hiding in there? You'll miss all the scary stuff.
,SpongeBob:, I don't want to see the scary stuff, Patrick. Okay? I admit it. I love trick-or-treating, but I am too afraid to go out on Halloween!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, don't you know the old saying? ""The only thing you have to fear is..."" ,[thinks for a second], Yourself! ,[looks in the mirror], Aah! Stop staring at me like that! No! ,[puts his mirror down], See? It's all in your head, SpongeBob. You just have to remember one simple trick, and that is: scary equals funny.
,SpongeBob:, Scary equals funny. Hm. Never looked at it that way before. ,[pulls himself out of Patrick's costume], Doink. All right. I'll go out. ,[sees the ghost balloon floating by and screams],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Here I am. ,[reveals himself hiding in Patrick's mouth; he shivers], Just looking for cavities. Nope. None here. Oh, let's go out and get scared.
,Both:, Whoo!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking up to Sandy's treedome.],
,Patrick:, Sure you can handle this, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'll be fine, Patrick. Really. But can we hold hands, just in case you get scared?
,Patrick:, Deal.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick enter Sandy's treedome, which has been made into a science lab.],
,Both:, Whoa...
,[Just then, a dark, shadowy figure creeps up behind SpongeBob and Patrick. The shadowy figure turned out to be Sandy in her mad scientist costume.],
,Sandy:, Welcome to my lab, SpongeBob and Patrick. I am the evil Dr. Franken-Cheeks.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Sandy. I didn't recognize you. ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, Uh, yeah, great costume.
,Sandy:, Oh, thanks, guys. Now, feast your fingers on my jars of horror!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whoa...
,Sandy:, Stick your hand in the jar and guess what's inside...If you dare!
,SpongeBob:, Oy. ,[sticks his hand in a jar and feels noodles], Ew. Oh. Ew, it feels like worm guts.
,Sandy:, Wrong! ,[removes napkin to reveal noodles], It's just noodles.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Oh, I'm savvy to this game, Sandy. ,[sticks his hand in a second jar and feels a squishy brain], So these brains are probably a slimy head of lettuce, or maybe some boiled broccoli.
,Sandy:, Wrong! It's— ,[removes napkin but reveals that Patrick is in the jar], Patrick? Get out of there.
,Patrick:, Don't stop, SpongeBob. That's the spot. Ah...
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you really got me. ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob continues poking Patrick's brain. Patrick makes some weird faces including the one where he sticks his eyeballs out with his tongue.],
,Sandy:, Ew! ,[cuts to Sandy showing SpongeBob and Patrick her creation], How impolite of me! I forgot to introduce you to my little friend. ,[reveals an acorn monster puppet underneath the tarp],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[timidly], Oh...
,SpongeBob:, That's the most realistic fake monster I ever saw.
,[The puppet comes to life and looks at SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,Sandy:, ,[as the acorn monster], Who are you calling fake?! ,[roars; SpongeBob and Patrick scream; Sandy laughs and activates the puppet; the puppet chases SpongeBob and Patrick], Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell the fear of a scared SpongeBob! ,[laughs manically],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick gibber in panic. The puppet grabs SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whoa!
,[The puppet eats them. Then it opens up its stomach to reveal that SpongeBob and Patrick are terrified on the spooky gadget inside. Then they pop out.],
,SpongeBob:, I love it! Oh, thank you, Sandy. That was so much fun. Patrick, you were right. Scary equals funny.
,SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy:, Hooray!
,[The scene changes to Squidward and Mr. Krabs setting up a haunted tourist attraction, as well as the Halloween party, for the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is dressed as a dollar bill while Squidward appears to not be wearing a costume. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come in and see the horrors of the Chum Bucket.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick enter inside. Patrick moans in fear. Inside, they see displays of Plankton doing scary things at the Chum Bucket.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[voiceover], Ha, ha, ha, ha! I'm Plankton! Ha, ha, ha, I'm evil! ,[laughs manically, but coughs],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the place, laughing.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Scary.
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you two laughing about? There's nothing funny about the food abuse that goes on at the Chum Bucket! You should be terrified!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sorry, Mr. Krabs, but our new philosophy is ""scary equals funny.""
,Squidward:, Yeah, and funny divided by two idiots equals stupid.
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't get it. When I was a kid, Halloween meant 24 continuous hours of screaming your head off! These kids today...
,[Patrick laughs as Mr. Krabs and Squidward turn and leave in disbelief.],
,Plankton:, ,[voiceover and wails], Come to the Chum Bucket, and witness the horrors of the Krusty Krab! You may never eat a Krabby Patty again! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Ready for more funny, Sir Clanks-a-lot?
,Patrick:, I'm driving! ,[picks up SpongeBob and uses him as a jousting lance; he charges towards the Chum Bucket], Charge! ,[laughs as he crashes into several trick-or-treaters who are dressed as bowling pins],
,Trick-Or-Treaters:, Whoa!
,[Patrick runs towards the Chum Bucket and crashes into a wall. SpongeBob and Patrick enter inside and Patrick sets SpongeBob down. Karen comes out, dressed as a cat.],
,Karen:, Welcome to the Chum Bucket. I'm Karen the cat. ,[meows],
,Plankton:, Do the scary part.
,[Karen turns on her screen and reveals a scary cat on it. Patrick moans in fear, but SpongeBob thinks it's funny and laughs.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, scary! ,[laughs],
,Plankton:, Scary? That's nothing. ,[pushes the button and switches into his devil costume], Behold! ,[reveals scary displays of the Krusty Krab], The horrors of the Krusty Krab. ,[laughs], Look down.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hm?
,SpongeBob:, Oh.
,Patrick:, Ooh.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick follow the arrows on the floor and enter Plankton's scary tourist attraction.],
,Plankton:, ,[over loudspeaker], No dawdling! Step right up! ,[shows a scary display of Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and Squidward], The evil Mr. Krabs and his band of jolly, mindless fools stalk Bikini Bottom by night for delicious victims then drag their lifeless bodies back to the kitchen, and grind them into grinders!
,[Karen pops up with a woman screaming on her screen. Patrick is terrified, but SpongeBob still finds it funny as he laughs.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Plankton, you are a panic.
,Plankton:, And guess what? You're eating it! Krabby Patties are people! They're people patties! You're eating people patties! ,[laughs and throws a Krabby Patty in Patrick's face],
,[SpongeBob laughs. Karen pops up and hisses like a cat. Patrick screams and hides in his costume. SpongeBob, still thinking it's funny, continues to laugh. Karen and Plankton are not impressed with SpongeBob's laughter.],
,Trick-Or-Treater 4:, Yeah! ,[giggles], Come on!
,[Trick-or-treaters in Bikini Bottom continue to have fun on Halloween. Everyone is laughing and chattering while others are ringing doorbells, asking for candy.],
,Trick-Or-Treater 5:, ,[pops out of a trashcan], Boo!
,Trick-Or-Treaters:, ,[screams],
,[One citizen laughs but gets scared by someone holding a toy spider. Meanwhile, in the skies above Bikini Bottom, a familiar green ghost ship sails in the clouds. The owner of the ship appears to be none other than the Flying Dutchman himself.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ah! Music to me ears. Halloween night, and everyone is getting their bloomers scared off! This holiday is the worst! ,[soberly], Wait a millennium. ,[takes out a telescope and sees a trick-or-treater not being scared], That kid isn't screaming with fear.
,[The Flying Dutchman takes out a fishing rod and fishes the trick-or-treater up.],
,Trick-Or-Treater 6:, Huh. What do you want?
,[The Flying Dutchman roars and makes a scary face. The trick-or-treater is now completely scared. He freaks out and falls down.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Scare and release! ,[laughs], I love this job.
,[Suddenly, he hears rattling on the side on his ship. It turns out to be SpongeBob's laughter. The Flying Dutchman looks down and one of SpongeBob's ""laughs"" hits him really hard.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ugh. ,[gets up and his eyes are red], Who dares to laugh at All Hallows' Eve?! ,[calmly], I'm going to find out.
,[The Flying Dutchman steers his ship downwards and stops right in between the Chum Bucket and the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob comes out of the Chum Bucket laughing while pulling a fainted Patrick out in a wagon.],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, who would've thought I'd be laughing myself silly tonight? ,[laughs],
,Flying Dutchman:, You! ,[people run away, screaming], You dare to laugh on Halloween?!
,SpongeBob:, Um...I guess so? ,[laughs],
,Flying Dutchman:, What's the matter with you? Aren't you afraid of scary things?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I was, until I found out that scary equals funny.
,Flying Dutchman:, ""Scary equals funny?"" ,[growls and roars while making a scary face],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs as he uses the Flying Dutchman's fire to roast marshmallows], I love this guy! ,[sighs and eats the toasted marshmallows],
,Flying Dutchman:, I don't get it. How could anyone confuse scary with funny? ,[turns around and looks at the Halloween decorations at the Krusty Krab], Hm. No wonder you're not scared. These decorations are laughable! ,[breaks a decoration in half], I'm sorry, kid. I had no idea how fright-deprived you were. Not to worry. You're in bad hands! ,[he uses his powers to turn the wagon into a little amusement park cart; SpongeBob climbs into it while Patrick regains consciousness], I'll show you something to scream about aboard me ship! ,[thunder claps as he points to his ghostly ship], You interested?
,SpongeBob:, Sure. Can I bring a guest?
,Flying Dutchman:, Does a bear fish sleep in the kelp forest? ,[he and SpongeBob laugh; then he snaps his fingers],
,[The Flying Dutchman's ship lowers a plank with rail tracks on it. The cart drives up the plank. SpongeBob is really excited about the ride while Patrick is really scared. The Flying Dutchman laughs sinisterly.],
,Patrick:, Where are we going, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, We are going to comedy heaven, Patrick. This is going to be so funny! ,[laughs],
,[Patrick whimpers as he holds SpongeBob. The cart stops in midair. The ship forms two doors and opens with a green mist seeping out.],
,Patrick:, This music doesn't sound funny, SpongeBob.
,[The doors close and Patrick continues to quiver with fear, clanking his costume in the process.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Stop that clanking!
,Patrick:, Sorry.
,[The cart drives into the darkness and the episode fades to black. The screen goes back on with the Flying Dutchman flying around SpongeBob and Patrick, laugh manically at them.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Hey!
,Flying Dutchman:, All bilge rats on deck! We have company, and we want to show them a good time! ,[laughs as he flies through SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], That tickled!
,[Just then, several ghostly pirates appeared, laughing manically at SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick is completely horrified while SpongeBob remains smiling, still thinking it's funny.],
,Flying Dutchman's Ghost Pirate:, Hang on to your bloomers, SpongeBob! It's going to be a bumpy fright! ,[laughs],
,[The ghosts continue to laugh. Patrick is clinging onto SpongeBob as the cart takes them to a skull-shaped door. SpongeBob yells excitedly while Patrick closes his helmet. The cart plows through the doors and drives across the tracks. The Flying Dutchman is playing the organ and his pirate ghost sing a little ghostly tune.],
,Flying Dutchman's Ghost Pirates:, ♪When you hear the lonesome ring of chimes that bring the spirits singing, soon your spine is tingling and there's just one thing to say, ahh! ,[eyeballs open up in the darkness], Eyeballs in the dark dilating, now your heart is palpitating, and there's only just one thought that you can convey. ,[all scream], Terror all around you! You can't get away! We take pride in making sure you have a frightful stay. ,[the cart drives on a haunted table], Join the wretched chorus in the nightmare play, and remember it's all you can scream at the ghost café.♪
,[Ghosts monsters wail and moan in a scary fashion. Patrick is really scared, but SpongeBob laughs, still thinking it's funny. The cart drives around a few loops as a three-headed horse skeleton pops out and neighs. The dragon skeleton pops out and shrieks. Another skull-shaped door opens and lets the cart drive through.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh...
,[The cart stops in the middle of what appears to be a pin the ball game machine.],
,Flying Dutchman's Ghost Pirates:, ♪Terror all around you and we've just begun. ,[a monster hand pulls the lever and activates the machine], You'll be trembling helpless lump of fear when we are done. Grim unearthly creatures flaunting nauseating features make for ghastly midnight screechers, you'll be speechless but for Ahh! ,[the machine flings SpongeBob and Patrick into a cannon and is shot in midair filled with ghosts], Surrender to the horrifying phantom freaks who death-defying stunts of fearful madness startle with a shocking interjection from which there is no protection! ,[all wail], Boo!♪
,[SpongeBob laughs as the cart falls through the floor. The Flying Dutchman leans over to hear. SpongeBob's laughter hits him hard again.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Grr...How can he still be laughing? I've never been so humiliated. I got to do something here.
,SpongeBob:, Boy, Patrick, I wish all our friends could be here. They'd love this place! ,[laughs],
,Flying Dutchman:, Friends! He's got friends. That's it! I know how to scare this guy. ,[laughs manically as he unleashes his ghostly mist down from his ship into Bikini Bottom],
,Sandy:, ,[gives candy to several trick-or-treaters], Happy Halloween! ,[the ghostly mist surrounds her and takes her soul from her body], W—what? Where?
,[Several trick-or-treaters run up to Mr. Krabs and Squidward, who are handing out candy.],
,Trick-Or-Treaters:, Trick or treat!
,[Suddenly, the Flying Dutchman's ghostly mist surrounds them and takes their souls from their bodies.],
,Squidward:, Huh? Oh! ,[screams],
,[The souls of Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are being lifted in the air by the ghostly mist.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey!
,[The trick-or-treaters laugh and throw eggs and toilet paper at Squidward and Mr. Krabs' motionless bodies. Mr. Krabs growls in anger. Back inside the Flying Dutchman's ship, SpongeBob and Patrick are still riding the cart. Patrick is still afraid while SpongeBob continues to laugh, still thinking it's funny. SpongeBob stops laughing and sighs. They turn to see Sandy's soul locked up in a cage.],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob! Patrick! Help me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], That almost looks like Sandy.
,[They see the souls of Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Squidward, and Gary locked up in cages as well.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob!
,Plankton:, Patrick!
,Squidward:, Help us!
,Gary:, ,[meows forlornly],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], That almost looked like Mr. Krabs and Squidward and Gary and Plankton. ,[laughs], Funny. Oh, Patrick, this is hysterical. ,[laughs], Why aren't you laughing? ,[laughs until he sees Patrick's body motionless], Patrick? What's wrong with you?
,Patrick:, ,[his soul is locked in a cage as well], Help me, SpongeBob! My body's butt itches!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick? Is this really happening? Hey, this isn't funny.
,Patrick:, I was wrong, SpongeBob. Sometimes, scary equals scary!
,[Patrick's motionless body falls on SpongeBob and he screams.],
,SpongeBob:, Hm? ,[pulls out his chalkboard, erases the word ""funny"", and replaces it with ""AHHH!""], Yup. I got the same answer. Scary equals ""Ahh!""
,Flying Dutchman:, Success! I knew that would get him!
,[SpongeBob is finally convinced that scary doesn't equal funny at all and screams in fear. His skeleton runs out of his body. SpongeBob's skin and skeleton run out of the ship.],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh!
,[SpongeBob's skeleton and skin fall to the ground and attempt to run.],
,SpongeBob's Skeleton:, That's the scariest thing I ever saw in my life!
,SpongeBob's Skin:, Me too. But we gotta go back.
,SpongeBob's Skeleton:, Go back? Are you nuts?
,SpongeBob's Skin:, Show a little backbone! We gotta save our friends!
,SpongeBob's Skeleton:, Oh, you're right. But I'm still scared. Will you hold my hand?
,SpongeBob's Skin:, Deal.
,[SpongeBob's skeleton and skin shake hands and they both go back together. SpongeBob runs back to the Flying Dutchman's ship to rescue his friends. Meanwhile, back in the ship, the Flying Dutchman flings Plankton's cage and laughs manically at the rest of SpongeBob's friends. Then he spins the cage around, frightening with various monsters.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ooh. ,[laughs],
,[Plankton comes up with an idea. He rips himself in half and floats out between the cage's bars. He puts himself together and floats up to the Flying Dutchman.],
,Plankton:, You know, I gotta say, pretty impressed with your whole evil presentation here. Nice work. I could use a guy like you to walk through walls. I take over the world, and we split it, 70-30. How's that grabbin' you? ,[the Flying Dutchman zaps Plankton and turns him into a ghoul], Yes, master... ,[kisses the Flying Dutchman's ring and flies onto his shoulder],
,Flying Dutchman:, I guess with friends like SpongeBob, you don't need anemones, huh, gang? ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, You can't talk about SpongeBob like that!
,Squidward:, Oh, yeah? If SpongeBob's so great, where is he? Huh?
,Flying Dutchman:, And, now, I'm going to roast your souls over a devil pit! ,[snaps his fingers and transports them over a devil pit], Just like Grandma used to!
,[They all scream.],
,Patrick:, The blue fire is so hot!
,[The Flying Dutchman laughs as he is about to roast everyone. Suddenly, Sandy's acorn puppet plows through the ceiling and roars, frightening the Flying Dutchman.],
,Sandy:, My puppet?
,[The acorn puppet growls and charges at the Flying Dutchman. However, because the Flying Dutchman is a ghost, the puppet was unable to touch him and is sent flying to a wall. The puppet breaks into pieces and tiny acorns, revealing SpongeBob inside.],
,SpongeBob:, You let my friends go, buddy boy! ,[slides down],
,Flying Dutchman:, You were trying to scare ,me,? Now that is funny. ,[laughs], You couldn't frighten me in a million eternities, kid.
,Plankton:, I think he could, master. You've never seen what's inside his brain!
,Flying Dutchman:, His brain? Ha! What's scary about that?
,Plankton:, I was in there once. It's too terrifying, even for ghosts!
,[The Flying Dutchman grabs Plankton, throws him to the ground and stomps on him with his ghostly boot. He raises his foot, revealing a completely smushed Plankton.],
,Flying Dutchman:, I'll decide if it's scary or not!
,[The Flying Dutchman shrinks himself into a smaller size, flies into SpongeBob's head and goes directly into his brain. He appears in the animation style of the Beatles' 1968 film Yellow Submarine and drives in a car with crab claws on them. He hears jolly music and the claws grab the little floating hearts. A unicorn-shaped cloud pushes him off the cliff and sends him crashing into a rainbow from a frog whose using it as a jump rope. He emerges out from the rainbow.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Wa...Whoa!
,[One claw grabs a talking stripe tree, swings around and around, and lets go, making a little character fall out of the car. An eel flies out of the car and flies in the air. Three penguins hitch a ride on the eel and fly into an igloo. The igloo turns into a baby stroller and kittens appear riding in it. SpongeBob appears in the Flying Dutchman's hat, laughing. A jellyfish stretches itself over the Flying Dutchman and jellybeans fall out from underneath. The Flying Dutchman is carried off by a seahorse who is smack its lips. They pass by a clam with a mermaid in it. Then they stop to a colorful door, which opens and reveals bouncing smiley balls.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ah! Ah! Ah! Don't—don't! ,[turns into a blob and a crab claw pinches him in half; he screams],
,[SpongeBob regains consciousness, rolls his eyes to the back of his head, and sees the Flying Dutchman crying.],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[cries], That didn't scare me one bit. ,[turns black and reveals eyeballs and a ghost; then he turns back to normal], I—I bet you don't have a scary thought in your entire brain!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, scary...Hm...You know, what always scares me out of the room is when my mom takes out naked baby pictures. ,[laughs],
,[Suddenly, a giant baby version of SpongeBob appears before the Flying Dutchman.],
,Baby SpongeBob:, ,[coos], I wuv you this much!
,[The Flying Dutchman screams and hyperventilates as the giant baby SpongeBob grabs and hugs him. Soon, all of the dream characters join in as the unicorn-shaped cloud makes a rainbow above them.],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[gets kissed by the eels], I'm actually scared! ,[screams as tombstones appear in his eyes; he flies out of SpongeBob's head and growls after having enough], So much horror! ,[screams as he flies out and leaves his ship],
,[The Flying Dutchman's ship disappears. SpongeBob and his friends' souls are now floating in midair. They look down, scream and fall to the ground.],
,Everyone:, Ahh!
,Sandy:, ,[her soul returns to her body], Ooh.
,Mr. Krabs and Squidward:, ,[scream and their souls return to their respective bodies, which pleases them], Oh.
,Patrick:, ,[his soul returns to his body], Oh! I got my butt back! ,[slaps his buttocks],
,Sandy:, I don't know what's inside that brain of yours, but I sure hope I never see it. Thanks, SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, ,[shows a chalkboard with the words ""Scary equals Scary"" with the word funny crossed out], But did we learn anything?
,SpongeBob:, Sure. We learned not to be afraid to never be scared of being afraid again. ,[laughs as he erases the chalkboard],
,[SpongeBob's friends carry SpongeBob and praise him for his heroic efforts of stopping the Flying Dutchman and saving the day.],
,Mr. Krabs:, My employee saved us! Party at the Krusty Krab! For a reasonable fee.
,[They carry SpongeBob inside the Krusty Krab as the ghost balloon flies over. Plankton, whose soul returned to his body, wakes up.],
,Plankton:, Ugh. What happened? Whew. Must have been a nightmare.
,Trick-Or-Treater 1:, ,[picks up Plankton], Hey, guys! Free candy!
,[The trick-or-treater throws Plankton in his mouth and starts chewing on him. The screen then says ""Happy Halloween"" to the viewers and ends the episode.],

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A scream is heard and an angry customer walks up to the register.],
,Shubie:, I wish to register a complaint!
,[She shows Squidward a sea urchin on her Krabby Patty. The urchin growls.],
,Squidward:, ,[screams], An urchin!
,Shubie:, Yuck!
,[She throws her patty and the urchin in the register boat.],
,Squidward:, Hey, lady, take your infested-patty with you! Okay, no need to panic, Squidward. It's just a puny urchin. Everything's gonna be fine as long as you...,[grabs his cash register and smashes the urchin with it], Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! ,[falls into the register and gets up], Whew!
,[Squidward sees the urchin on his nose and freaks out. He attempts to smash the urchin with the register, but ends up getting smashed in the face. SpongeBob comes by, pushes the button, and Squidward pops his head out from the register. The urchin is heard whimpering.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward, I'm surprised at you. That little urchin wasn't hurting anyone. ,[removes the urchin from Squidward's nose], He's still one of Neptune's creatures. No matter how small he is. ,[walks into the kitchen with the urchin], This is where the magic happens, little urchin. First, we turn up the heat, but don't make it too hot. ,[turns on the heat on the grill], Would you like to see a menu, Monsieur? ,[laughs as the urchin bites SpongeBob's nose], Ow!
,[The urchin falls onto the knob, turns the grill up to a high temperature, and crawls underneath.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, little guy, see you later. ,[rubs his nose], Good thing he is a little guy. Ouch.
,[As SpongeBob leaves to get more patties, the grill turns red-hot. SpongeBob comes back with the patties and flops them on the grill. The patties hop up and down in a Latin rhythm and SpongeBob dances. Outside the kitchen, Squidward is sweating from the grill's high temperature and his employee hat catches on fire. SpongeBob dances so much that his body begins to sweat. His sweat drops fall on the hot grill and gives off steam. The patties are completely burned and they shrink to a smaller size.],
,SpongeBob:, What the shrimp? ,[his body starts shrinking], Hey, what's going on here? ,[notices the high temperature on the grill], Whoa! That's too hot! ,[tries to turn the grill down, but his fingers are too sweaty], Whooaaa! ,[shrinks down to a smaller size and comes out from the sleeve of his pants], Wow. ,[notices he's naked], Oops. ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob climbs up to the condiment counter and grabs two pickles slices for clothing. He walks over to the toaster and looks at his reflection.],
,SpongeBob:, I steamed myself tiny. Whoo-hoo! I steamed myself tiny! Whoo! ,[turns and sees the entire kitchen], This place is huge! ,[gasps and jumps back down to the floor], My spatula's huge! And just look at the size of my grill. It's huge! ,[climbs up to the grill, touches the surface and burns his toe], Ow!
,[SpongeBob grabs two slices of butter and plops his feet on them to make them as ice skates. He sings to himself and skates a figure eight on the grill's surface. However, because of the high temperature, the butter immediately melts and SpongeBob's feet catch on fire.],
,SpongeBob:, Ow! ,[stammers and screams],
,[SpongeBob jumps into a can of ketchup. He sighs in relief. Then he attempts to flip the patty with his spatula.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[grunting], Come on, flip! Whoa! ,[gets flopped by the patty],
,[SpongeBob drills a hole through the patty with his drill-like nose. He pulls out his drill-nose and recreates a new one. He laughs just as the grill short-circuits and blows out.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh-oh. The grill blew out. Well, ,[sniffs], it isn't gonna fix itself. ,[flicks his nose], That's one small step for SpongeBob, one giant leap for— ,[jumps down to the bottom of the grill], Whee! ,[lands in a goop of grease], Whoa! ,[absorbs the grease, which makes him lose his pickle clothes], Bob. ,[spits the grease out], Whew! ,[slips a little bit], Whoa!
,[SpongeBob wanders around under the grill and hears a noise as if someone is crying.],
,SpongeBob:, What is that?
,[SpongeBob climbs on a rotten Krabby Patty and sees the urchin caught in a trap.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, it's my little urchin friend. Aww, hey, little guy, don't cry. Your old pal, WheeBob, will get ya outta there.
,[SpongeBob tries to pull the spring-loaded bar up, but ends up pulling off his arms. SpongeBob then uses his teeth to hold the bar up, which frees the urchin. But SpongeBob ends up losing his dentures. He smiles and laughs.],
,SpongeBob:, Little urchin, you are free to go! You okay?
,[The urchin roars and SpongeBob screams. The urchin then gives SpongeBob a chase.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[pricks SpongeBob with its prickles], Yeouch!
,[The urchin chases SpongeBob up to the grill, across the fryers and up to the soda dispenser. SpongeBob clings on the lever and pours soda on the urchin.],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry little guy! ,[falls off the lever], Whoa!
,[The soda sends SpongeBob and the urchin down the drain in the middle of the floor.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
,[SpongeBob clings onto one of the holes of the drain while the urchin falls deeper into the sewer.],
,SpongeBob:, Follow the pipes to freedom, little guy! I'll never forget you. ,[pulls the prickle off his butt], Really. ,[climbs out of the drain and hears a loud noise], Ow! What is all that noise?
,Squidward:, ,[rings bell], One Krabby Patty!
,SpongeBob:, Comin' right up!
,[SpongeBob carries a Krabby Patty out from the kitchen and into the dining room. Squidward takes notice of SpongeBob and thinks he's another urchin.],
,Squidward:, Urchin?! ,[grabs a ladle and pushes a customer aside], Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
,[Squidward swings his ladle around as he attempts to hit SpongeBob. In doing so, he ends up hitting the customers and knocking over several tables. During the chase, SpongeBob bumps into Mr. Krabs' foot.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah-ha! ,[picks up the patty with SpongeBob], You're gettin' sloppy, Plankton. Squidward almost squashed ya. ,[laughs and opens the door], Back to the bucket with ya!
,SpongeBob:, No! No, Mr. Krabs! It's meeee! ,[gets kicked out and sent flying to the doors of the Chum Bucket], Whoa-ho! ,[lands safely on the floor],
,[Karen scans SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! ,[giggles], That tickles.
,Karen:, Well, SpongeBob SquarePants, it looks like you lost a little weight.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Karen. Where's Plankton?
,Karen:, You landed on him.
,[SpongeBob looks down and sees that he is sitting directly on Plankton.],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Plankton! ,[gets off],
,Plankton:, SpongeBoob? Why are you so small? Is this a trick?
,Karen:, Calm down. He's clean. I frisked him.
,SpongeBob:, I didn't mean to get small like you, Plankton. It was a freak accident.
,Plankton:, Huh? Who are you callin' a freak?! Wait a second. ,[giggles and takes out a tape measure], Hold this. ,[measures SpongeBob while he holds the tape; gasps], You're not small like me, Shorty! I am a towering half-a-millimeter taller than you! ,[laughs], I win! ,[laughs evilly],
,SpongeBob:, Hooray! ,[lets go of the tape and Plankton gets himself tangled in it], I'll get that.
,Plankton:, Don't touch that! ,[gets sliced up by the tape],
,SpongeBob:, Oops.
,Plankton:, ,[falls into pieces], Get him outta here, Karen!
,Karen:, Way ahead of ya, Chief.
,[Karen flicks SpongeBob out of the Chum Bucket and sends him flying into the windows of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob slides down the window just as a purple kid named Ryan comes by.],
,Ryan:, Cool!
,[The kid grabs SpongeBob and chews on him like gum. Then he runs into the restaurant and meets up with his friends.],
,Ryan:, ,[spits SpongeBob out], Ha, ha! I've found an action figure!
,Kid #2:, Whoa! I saw it first!
,Kid #3:, No, I did!
,Ryan:, Finders keepers!
,[Ryan swings SpongeBob during the fight.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa!
,Kid #2:, What's the matter with you?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets licked by Ryan], Bleach!
,Ryan:, Got my spit on it!
,SpongeBob:, ,[slips out of the kid's hand], Whoa! You can't catch me! ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob runs into the Krabby Playland ball pit while the kids chase him.],
,Ryan:, Stop him! Don't let him get away!
,[The kids jump in the ball pit and send numerous balls flying. SpongeBob rides on a red ball and bounces on several tables. The kids continue chasing him, knocking over several tables in the process. SpongeBob jumps off the ball and laughs.],
,Ryan:, ,[gets hit by the ball], This is the best action figure ever!
,[SpongeBob jumps into the register boat and hops into Squidward's shirt pocket.],
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob in the corner pocket! Doink!
,[The kids jump into the register boat and pummel Squidward.],
,Squidward:, You brats get back in the play area or I'll eighty-six your face!
,[SpongeBob, who is on Squidward's head, blows a raspberry, dances, laughs and shakes his butt.],
,Kids:, We want our action figure back!
,[The orange kid kicks Squidward's leg.],
,Squidward:, Ow!
,[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Krusty Krab action figures aren't free ya know! So, get your parents' money and you can have it.
,[The kids stare menacingly at the other customers. Everyone leaves their tables and run out while the kids chase them.],
,Squidward:, Uh, Eugene, we don't sell action figures.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looks at SpongeBob], Hmm...
,SpongeBob:, Peekaboo!
,[Mr. Krabs gasps.],
,Squidward:, What the—,[faints],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what are you doing in my hand? And why aren't you back there flippin' patties?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. K. I shrunk myself by mistake. But I won't let it affect my job. I will get back to flippin' right now. ,[goes for the kitchen, but gets pulled back by Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold on there, Tiny. I can't have you workin' the grill no more. Too dangerous for a little guy like you.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, please, Mr. Krabs! There must be some job I could do! I don't care what it is! Please, please, please!
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, I'll think of somethin'. But since you're so small now, I can only pay ya a penny. A year.
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! ,[receives a penny], That's big money! ,[gets squished by the penny], Whoa!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. Now what could I do with a little SpongeBob?
,[Mr. Krabs forms a thinking cloud while he thinks. In the cloud, a sign is formed with the words, ""Personal Hygiene Service"" on it. He likes the idea and takes the sign from the thinking cloud. He swipes the cloud away and hammers the sign on the menu.],
,Dirty Customer:, Personal Hygiene Service?
,[The customers line up.],
,Customer:, Did you see that? Personal Hygiene Service!
,Mr. Krabs:, Roll up your sleeves, boy-o! You're a personal hygienist now!
,SpongeBob:, Whoo-hoo! Yay!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob cleaning the food off of a customer's teeth. Then he rubs his body around the back of another customer.],
,Tom:, Oh, right there. Yeah.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob mowing the back hair of another customer's back with a mini lawnmower. Then he cleans the fungus out from under the toe of another customer.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew!
,Mr. Krabs:, Break time, SpongeBob! Take five, but hurry back! You gotta start earnin' that penny!
,[SpongeBob runs into the kitchen and climbs onto the sink to wash up.],
,Squidward:, ,[walks in the kitchen, mumbling], Hmph. Work the register, clean the windows, make the patties. I have to do everything now. Thanks a lot, ShrinkBob. ,[flips a patty but ends up getting it in his eye, burning it], Ow! Ow! ,[grunts as the patty falls on the grill],
,SpongeBob:, It's okay, Squidward! I'll make the patties for you—oh. Yeah. I forgot. I'm too little. ,[sits down on a bar of soap], Boy, I'm really gonna miss my old job.
,[Squidward puts eye drops in his burnt eye.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Lunch rush is over, Mr. Squidward! Now, wash those dishers!
,Squidward:, ,[growls and mumbles], ""Lunch rush is over, Mr. Squidward. Now, wash some dishes.""
,[Squidward stomps over to the sink, grabs SpongeBob and rubs him against a dirty dish with soap and water. Suddenly, the soap and water makes SpongeBob grow bigger.],
,SpongeBob:, The bubbles are making me bigger! More bubbles!
,Squidward:, What the—,[freaks out and throws SpongeBob in the sink],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, Squidward! I'm big enough to flip patties again! ,[grows larger due to the soap and water], Oh-ho-ho!
,[SpongeBob grows larger until his arms, while holding Mr. Krabs and Squidward, pop through the walls of the restaurant.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa!
,Squidward:, Ahh!
,[SpongeBob's head pops through the ceiling. The customers are squished against the windows.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, call the fire department!
,SpongeBob:, No need to call 'em, Mr. Krabs. ,[pulls his feet through the floor], We'll be there in five minutes depending on traffic. ,[laughs as he walks off with Squidward and Mr. Krabs in his hands and while using the entire restaurant as new clothes],
,Mr. Krabs:, Make a left at the light!

"Squidward:, Okay, would you like any fries with that?
,Customer #1:, Uh, ,[turns around to the other customers], Hey, if I get some kelp fries, would you guys share them with me?
,Jimmy:, Do we know you?
,Customer #1:, ,[turns back to Squidward], Two orders of kelp fries, please.
,Squidward:, And two orders of—
,Customer #1:, I only said one order.
,Squidward:, But you said ""two.""
,Customer #1:, Okay, I'll have two.
,Squidward:, ,[takes out a ticket for the customers' order], SpongeBob, order up. ,[all the tickets are stuck in the window, he sighs], Welcome to The Krusty— ,[all the tickets get shot out and Squidward walks in the kitchen], SpongeBob, what in Neptune's... ,[sees that SpongeBob's body can't move], SpongeBob? ,[pushes him back and forth and hat tips over. touches spatula], Well, his spatula's still warm. ,[pokes his eye], Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shows up in the kitchen], Ahoy, Squidward. ,[sees SpongeBob], Good Neptune, SpongeBob. What has gotten into to you, son?
,Squidward:, I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, Squidward. This is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days. ,[shakes SpongeBob], What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money! ,[SpongeBob's hat falls off and Mr. Krabs picks up what's in it], It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date. ,[reads the date on the 23rd], ""Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab.""
,Squidward:, That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say. ,[both Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are quivering], I rest my case. ,[the doors get pushed away and a fish version of Gene Shalit named ""Gene Scallop"" enters and sniffs the air in the restaurant], Hey, in or out, mister. You're lettering out the A.C. ,[the fish stares at Squidward], Weirdo.
,Mr. Krabs:, Why, hello. You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't you? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine... ,[Gene Scallop walks away and up to Squidward],
,Squidward:, Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop. Don't you know our lives depend on his review?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 6:00. ,[Mr. Krabs walks over to Gene Scallop],
,Mr. Krabs:, M— Mr. Scallop, wait, please. Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely— ,[spits while trying to say ""free""], Complimentary. ,[cut to SpongeBob squirting mustard on Mr. Scallop's patty, then putting the bun on], Okay, SpongeBob, that'll be all. ,[SpongeBob lifts up his hat, then puts it back down and leaves], He's nobody. ,[Gene takes the Krabby Patty and takes one bite, then leaves without saying a word], We're doomed! ,[cut to news on the TV as cats meow],
,Barbara:, And there were no survivors.
,Bob:, Thank you, Barbara.
,Barbara:, Thank you, Bob.
,Squidward:, She is so tacky.
,Bob:, And now it's time for ""Bottom Feeding"" with Gene Scallop.
,Mr. Krabs:, Turn it up, Squidward. ,[Squidward turns it up],
,Gene Scallop:, Thank you, Bob. This week, I visited--
,Bob:, You're welcome, Gene.
,Gene Scallop:, ,[clears throat and moves his glasses], This week, I reviewed The Krusty Krab restaurant, a local burger joint that's second to none; or should I say second to ""run,"" since this critic wanted to make like a banana and peel out the minute he saw how drab this Krab really was.
,Barbara:, That bad, huh, Gene?
,Gene Scallop:, Barbara, once I stuck my beak through that door, my appetite flew South for the winter. I mean, I'm not ""kidding"" when I saw this restaurant smells like the rear-end of a goat. ,[customers smell the aroma, and a gas noise is heard],
,Bob:, And how was the service, Gene?
,Gene Scallop:, You could find livelier help in a graveyard and I'm not just ""coffin."" ,[two customers are whispering to each other], The management stunk so bad, I had to get my sweater dry cleaned on the way home... with me ,in, it. ,[customers start mumbling and walking out],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, no, wait! Wait!
,Gene Scallop:, ,[too close to Barbara and Bob], However, at the end of my visit, I chowed down on a meal that titillated my taste buds and gratified my gullet. That sponge behind the grill is no square when it comes to cooking. ,[excited talking as the customers rush to sit down at their tables for some food], If Krabs really wanted to soak up the dough, he'd sponge it up, he'd sponge it out, he'd oversponge it. You can never have too much sponge. ,[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Well, back to work.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ay, ay-ay-ay-ay... That's me boy, SpongeBob. That's me boy. ,[SpongeBob walks in the kitchen as a dollar sign while register rings keep sounding. Cut to a line of fish lined up at The Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow. ,[Mr. Krabs is working on putting a new sign called ""The Krusty Sponge""],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, a little lower, lower— that's perfect.
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.
,SpongeBob:, Oh. you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—
,Mr. Krabs:, Umm— yeah, a little bit like that. ,[cut to inside of the Krusty Sponge where SpongeBob walks past Squidward, dressed in a SpongeBob costume with a sign behind saying ""As Seen on TV""],
,SpongeBob:, Morning, Squidward. Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes? ,[Squidward hisses at SpongeBob],
,Tyler:, Look, it's him! ,[walks up to Squidward], Mr. SquarePants, can I have your autograph?
,Squidward:, No.
,Tyler:, But, why?
,Squidward:, Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. See? ,[shakes his arms, but accidentally hits Tyler],
,Tyler:, Ow!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, what's going on over here?
,Tyler:, He hit me, just as I wanted his autograph.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph— for five bucks.
,Tyler:, What a rip. ,[walks away. Gumbles madly, goes to a table],
,Mr. Krabs:, Look at these, Squidward! ,[holds up napkins that have SpongeBob's face on them],
,Squidward:, Looks like some horrific shroud.
,Mr. Krabs:, They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent.
,Squidward:, You really need to see a doctor.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes. ,[points to a stack of boxes that say ""KK"" on them],
,Squidward:, What's in them?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[takes out two bottles that have SpongeBob's face as a label and red nozzles], Condiments. We got ""Tangy Spongy Sauce"" and ""Mild Bobby Sauce"" for the not-so-daring.
,Squidward:, Oh, clever. ,[SpongeBob runs up to Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!
,Mr. Krabs:, I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward. ,[sticks it into the costume's forehead], You're on grill duty now.
,Squidward:, But that's SpongeBob's job!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him. ,[cut to SpongeBob as the engineer in the train that is going around The Krusty Krab], Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train. Tickets are only $1.98. Seatbelts not included. ,[everyone cheers. Cut to the kitchen, where Squidward is looking at the spatula that is on the grill],
,Squidward:, Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm— ,[grunts while trying to get the spatula. Hits it with one of the costume arms and hits himself in the forehead, sending him back into pots and pans], Mommy, is that you? ,[outside, SpongeBob is tired of pedaling the train],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Mr. Krabs. I really think I should be getting back to the grill, now.
,Mr. Krabs:, Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers! ,[uses the megaphone], Who's ready for another lap? ,[everyone cheers], Keep on truckin', SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office. ,[cut to Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, entering Mr. Krabs' office],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it? ,[Mr. Krabs is bathing in his money],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Nervous],No.
,Squidward:, Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Nervous],Okay, tell them I'll be right out.
,Squidward:, Got it. ,[as he turns around, he hits his head on the top of the door entrance], Ow. ,[mutters],
,Mr. Krabs:, And let's watch the language, Squidward. ,[cut to Mr. Krabs signing for the packages],
,Joe:, Just sign here, here and here.
,Mr. Krabs:, My pleasure.
,Squidward:, What the heck is this stuff?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws— ,[shows a green straw with SpongeBob in the middle], coasters— ,[holds up two coasters with SpongeBob's face on them], bibs— ,[holds up a bib with SpongeBob's face on it that says ""I soiled myself at The Krusty Sponge""], and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes! ,[shows them, but they melt away], Aww.
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Showing signs of delusion],Get back to work, SpongeBob. I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me. ,[walks away crazily as Squidward is not surprised. Cut to Squidward flipping a patty and laughing at his success], Whoops! ,[sets three boxes down on the floor], There you go, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Now what?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties. ,[shows a yellow patty with green holes],
,Squidward:, Spongy Patties?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones. ,[tosses one on the grill],
,Squidward:, Where'd you get them?
,Mr. Krabs:, They were just in the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.,[he chuckles],
,Squidward:, You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98. ,[shuts the kitchen door. Cut to SpongeBob blowing the whistle on the Fun Train, but he’s really tired],
,SpongeBob:, All aboard.
,Nat:, Hey, we didn't pay $3.00 to watch you take a nap!
,Sadie:, That's the worst SpongeBob costume I've ever seen! ,[all the passengers chant], Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride! ,[SpongeBob sneaks away and takes the statue of himself, where Billy is going to get a picture by a camera by Harold, and puts it in his seat of the Fun Train, then squeezes through the doors of the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion? ,[screams after Buddy, Bill, Tina, Sadie, Sandals and Frank with green spots similar to SpongeBob's holes walking around like zombies], Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me!
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.
,SpongeBob:, Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies! ,[screams as the zombies walk towards him], Open up, open up, open up, open up! ,[bangs on the door hard enough to where it collapses on the floor],
,Mr. Krabs:, Who? ,[Mr. Krabs is dressed in a nice shirt with a pile of money in the chair across from him],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob— ,[sees the zombies and gasps], Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies— they're here to eat me money! ,[tries to run back into his office, but SpongeBob grabs him and turns him around],
,SpongeBob:, Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look! ,[two fish are sitting at the table. One is yellow with green spots and the other one is normal-looking],
,Sandals:, ,[groans], I ate this yellow Krabby Patty and now I feel sick.
,Bailiff:, Krabby Patty? ,[takes a bite and spits it out, then glares at the worried Mr. Krabs before he walks up to him ], Man, you've got some serious problems. If you're trying to pass that off as a Krabby Patty—
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Nervously],It's a... It's a Spongy Patty. ,[Bailiff turns yellow with green spots],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, what have you done?! You poisoned all these people!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Shocked and guilty],No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I... ,[Mr. Krabs looks down at his wrists because they are in handcuffs], What the...?
,Bailiff:, ,[shows his police badge], Tell it to the judge, Krabs. ,[cut to the courtroom],
,Guard:, Calling the courtroom to attention in the case ""People of Bikini Bottom vs. Mr. Krabs."" The honorable Judge Horace A. Whopper presiding.
,Judge Horace A. Whopper:, ,[clears throat], Has the jury reached a verdict? ,[jury is all yellow with green spots. Gene Scallop stands up and is yellow with green spots, too],
,Gene Scallop:, ,[along with angry fish, except Tina who is not angry], We have, your honor. We the jury find the defendant, Eugene H. Krabs, guilty of all charges.
,Judge Horace A. Whopper:, Very well. Does the defendant have anything to say before we send him down the river?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sadly], No, your honor.
,Judge Horace A. Whopper:, Very well. ,[bangs the SpongeBob gavel down. When he does, it laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, hang on a second there, judge. That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?
,Judge Horace A. Whopper:, Oh, why, yes. It's my prized possession. I am a huge SpongeBob fan.
,Mr. Krabs:, Permission to approach the bench, your honor! ,[cut to a patty being flipped on the grill],
,SpongeBob:, Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position. ,[outside, Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, is giving the judge a ride on the Fun Train. The judge has a whip in his hand], Take him around as many times as you like.
,Judge Horace A. Whopper:, I just might have to take you up on that. ,[winks and cracks his whip so Squidward goes faster],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs], I love a happy ending.

"[Scene takes place at the Bikini Bottom Dock & Shipyard ~according to the sign~, where some children are about to go on a trip to somewhere. We then see these children in colorful uniforms waiting in line for a boat. SpongeBob is seen in the uniform, but has piles of luggage. SpongeBob touches his stuff twice gently, and both times let out a small ding of clean-ness. He then claps his hands like he's playing the cymbals, to get rid of the dirt. We then hear a voice],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! ,[We then see that it's Patrick. He's running to the dock for SpongeBob], SpongeBob! ,[He falls into the water, and tries to get out, while talking underwater. We see these three children fish looking down at him. Patrick then climbs the deck where SpongeBob is, and gets up. He's now in front of him], SpongeBob! You forgot to tell me you're leaving! ,[They both start to have tears in their eyes, then very quivering mouths],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Patrick, I guess... ,[Both wobbling in sadness], I did. ,[Both hug each other and both start to cry as if they're making a river of tears],
,Patrick:, I'm gonna miss you, buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Me too, Patrick, me too! ,[In the background, we can start to hear happy music and some marching. We then see what the boat is, and we see the children singing. The sign says, ""Camp Sun-N-Fun or Bust!"" The children are singing: ""Sun Fun Island; get some fun. Sun Fun Island, here we come. Sun Fun Island; to get some fun!"". Cries of joy can be heard. Confetti starts falling, and SpongeBob and Patrick are still crying. The children can still be heard singing along to the song. Another boat comes up, but it's metal platted, and doesn't look too friendly. We then see people wearing black and white stripped hats and overalls wearing handcuffs, marching to the boat. They look like prisoners. We then see that it has wires with pointed blades on them at the top, and barred windows. At the entrance, we see this Warden looking out. SpongeBob and Patrick are still crying. They then suddenly give in, and stop crying], Oh, Patrick, if I had only known how hard not saying goodbye could be... ,[SpongeBob then gets an idea, and we hear the idea bell. SpongeBob yells like he got an idea. He then starts stuttering on how good the idea is],
,Patrick:, Well, see you later, bud. ,[SpongeBob grabs him and interrupts],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, That's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye!
,Patrick:, Summer camp? But I'm not even ready yet!
,SpongeBob:, How about now?
,Patrick:, Yep! ,[We then see the normal bubble transition. We're now in the entrance to the scary boat with the Warden in front of it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to the Warden], ...this stuff is just my carry-on, quarter. ,[We see them smiling, with SpongeBob carrying two purses, and Patrick holding a wooden coffin], The rest of my things are right over there. ,[SpongeBob points to where they are, and the Warden gets angry, and starts growling. SpongeBob tosses his stuff to the Warden, and runs in. Patrick does the same.],
,Patrick:, Weee! Haha!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, and quarter, thanks! ,[He tosses a quarter to the Warden. The Warden gets so angry, he burns a hole through the coffin, but very calmly. He starts to move his eyes in a swiftly manner, and tosses the stuff to the body of water. He goes in, locks the door with metal bars with pointy ends, and leaves with the stuff on the dock. We then see fog everywhere. We see SpongeBob, up close, looking out on the barred window. The camera zooms out, and we see the boat SpongeBob was suppose to be on], Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys? ,[He looks back in the boat, and we see the prisoners. SpongeBob is smiling, but the prisoners are not. They're sitting there, on benches in the middle of the room, with annoyed-mean expression on their face. A light bulb is swinging around in the background], Guys? ,[We then see lightning strike, and we see their destination: a small island, filled with rocky, pointy-edged, rocks that seem would kill you if you touched it. There's a fort in the middle, with barbed wire at the top, and an open room in the middle. They're all standing there in a corner. We zoom in there, and the door slams opened. We see the Warden go in, and as he comes in, we hear his footsteps, and see the prisons watch in silence, with sweat on their face. We then see the Warden's boots walking towards them. We get a close up of the people, and see all but SpongeBob and Patrick are having that same look. SpongeBob and Patrick have their mouths shaped like an ""o"", with them looking at the Warden in amazement. We then see a close-up of the Warden's face, and he has a tense expression on his face],
,Warden:, Welcome to Inferno Island! ,[We then see SpongeBob and Patrick, screaming with joy], [yelling] What in the seven seas just insulted my ear drum!? Could that had been an unrequested sound-off? Well, it must had been my imagination! And you can all thank your lucky stars that ,[He gets in their faces], I have a very active imagination! Because it so happens that it is my sworn duty to think of fun things to do with the trash that society has thrown away!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Whispering to Patrick], I had always preferred to recycle. ,[Everyone starts to snicker, except the Warden. We hear a whistle, and then we span up to SpongeBob and Patrick],
,Warden:, Holy fishpaste! We got ourselves a couple of ""rabble rousers."" What's your name, son?
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob SquarePants! ,[He says it very happily],
,Warden:, And are you a rabble rouser?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Chuckles for a second], Funny you should ask... once I had...
,Warden:, Well, I hope you aren't, because you sure look mighty tasty. It isn't too soon after breakfast for me to want to chew somebody's head off!
,Patrick:, ,[Whispers to SpongeBob], Actually, I am a little hungry.
,Warden:, Hungry?! Barney, fetch these two poor hungry souls a snack. On the double! ,[Barney then comes back and throws tires in front of them. SpongeBob and Patrick look at the tires, and we hear bicycle horns going off. We then see the Warden and Barney, and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick eat the tires. We then see some prisoners],
,Prisoner #1:, Ohh. These guys are tough! ,[We then see SpongeBob and Patrick with full bellies],
,Patrick:, The food coma is setting in.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. I could use a nap. ,[The Warden comes up quickly, and startles them],
,Warden:, Did you just say nap?! Well, I know the perfect place for you two to go digest that meal. ,[We see them smiling, and the bubble transition comes up again. We see them both in a hole in the ground that's shaped like a cube, and with a barred window-like door at the top], A couple days in the hole never hurt anybody. ,[They close the door, and we go to SpongeBob and Patrick. We see SpongeBob laying on a corpse],
,SpongeBob:, This camp is very upscale! ,[We then see 3 prisoners carrying a metal tub labeled ""chum"" on it. At the top, we do see some chum dripping out. We then see the chum has a bone, shoe, and an eyeball in it. The prisoners then dump it into the hole.],
,Patrick:, I had no idea that they had a hot tub! ,[We then see a timecard that says ""Three days later""],
,Narrator:, Three days later...
,Warden:, Alright! Let them out! ,[Someone who looks like Barney opens the door. The Warden looks at the prisoners], Now pay attention, worms. Watch the way they crawl out on their bellies, begging for mercy, and see what's waiting for you, next time you fell up to same way these two did! ,[Warden looks at them, and notices. We see SpongeBob and Patrick with their body all chunky. SpongeBob's head is like a boxed bubble, and Patrick is all chubby],
,SpongeBob:, It was quite an enjoyable soap, but it wasn't until this guy got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!
,Patrick:, Not bad! Except for this aftertaste. ,[Patrick's breath reaches its way to the Warden and the Warden smells it. His eyes get big in disgust. The prisoners are now coughing, because it smells so bad],
,Warden:, Cut your traps, all of ya, because of that little outburst, I am going to treat you all to an activity so heart-wrenchingly boring, it physically exhausting, that it is guaranteed to render your souls broken beyond repair!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Yay! ,[Another bubble transition occurs, and then we are at in a mine, where the prisoners are mining the rocks. They all look bored, except for SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?
,Patrick:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, It's made it even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights. ,[We zoom out to a view of Inferno Island, where we see it's storming even worse. We then go in where they sleep],
,',Warden:, ,[In background. We now see SpongeBob in ""bed""], Good night, ladies! ,[We then hear the prisoners complaining, and then SpongeBob pats his pillow, grabs it, and notices that it's made out of paper. SpongeBob gets on the side of his bed and sighs],
,Patrick:, What's wrong, SpongeBob? ,[We now know that Patrick is on the bottom bunk],
,SpongeBob:, The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me.
,Patrick:, If only we could think of some sort group activity that we can all do together, then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other. ,[Patrick rolls to his right, and we hear sliding], Good night! ,[We then hear the usual idea noise, and we see SpongeBob has a light bulb above his head],
,SpongeBob:, That's it! We'll show him we can be self-starters! ,[We see a bubble transition, and then we see SpongeBob at a desk, typing on a typewriter, with a lamp on. The clock says 9:00, and we then see SpongeBob from the typewriter's point of view, and there are mounds of typed papers. SpongeBob is pushing the typewriter keys one by one, with one finger each. We see the clock again, and it says 7:30. SpongeBob then gets in front of the door labeled ""Warden"", with his pile of papers in front of him. SpongeBob then slides each paper under the door, one by one, until the whole thing is inside. Then we go to the place where they sleep, and we hear the Warden blow his whistle],
,Warden:, Rise and shine! ,[Everyone gets in a line in front of the Warden], Now, which one of you vile, low-down, vile miserable wretched swine left this pathetic, worthless, horror and meaningless... ,[Breathes deeply],
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob then raises his right arm, and points with one finger up], Uh... abomination?
,Warden:, Who said that?
,SpongeBob:, Me, sir! ,[SpongeBob waves with his right arm, while being perky],
,Warden:, What is the meaning of this thing?
,SpongeBob:, It's a play, for our amusement, and inspiration! ,[Warden backs up, and looks like he's in shock, and then ponders],
,Warden:, Good. Well then, I'll watch your play, and I will enjoy every act of your pathetic, meaningless, ridiculous, production. You know why?
,Guard:, Uhh...because you cherish the fine art of thespianism?
,Warden:, No! Because this will be the last act you will ever perform in your pathetic lives! So, get to it! And I'd better be truly entertained!
,SpongeBob:, Cool! ,[We see the bubble transition, and we see them working on building a steam-powered boat, while the others are mining],
,Prisoner #2:, Kid's wasting his time. ,[Stops, and notices they're making a boat],
,SpongeBob:, All done! ,[We zoom out, and see it. It really is an actual boat],
,Prisoner #2:, You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
,Prisoner #3:, Hmmmmm...
,Prisoner #2:, It's a boat, you simpleton! What do boats do?
,Prisoner #3:, Ummm... make smoke?
,Prisoner #2:, No! ,[He slaps #3], You knucklehead! They float, away from this island, with all of us on board! ,[All of the prisoners huddle up], Now, here's the plan: ,[We now hear whispering, and we're unable to tell what they say. They then turn to the boat], Hey, buddy! Need some help?
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Prisoner #2:, Sure!
,Narrator:, Opening Night"". [We then see an actual red curtain and stage lights at the dock. We see 3 chairs in the front of it. They all sit down.]
,[One of the guards is holding popcorn and the Warden is holding a program that's labeled, ""Play Bill"". The curtain then rises, and we then see SpongeBob looking through a spies warden],
,SpongeBob:, Aye, for Jib's men, what forces blow the merry winds of Galilee?
,[cuts to the prisoners behind the curtains],
,Prisoner #4:, Get ready!
,Prisoner #5:, Umm... Oh! ,[the prisoners suddenly become happy],
,Prisoner #4:, ♪'Tis we...♪
,Prisoners:, ♪...here to sing the song of merry time for all of day. Together!♪ ,[Patrick is playing an electric guitar and plays a wild solo], ♪Together!♪
,SpongeBob & Prisoners:, ♪Together!♪ ,[Patrick is playing an electric drum set], ♪Together!♪ ,[Patrick is playing a synthesizer and strikers a chord],
,Prisoners:, ♪Together!♪
,SpongeBob, Patrick & Prisoners:, ♪Together! Together! To-geth-er.♪
,Prisoner #2:, ♪Like a boat, upon the sea!♪
,Prisoners:, ♪Together! In happy camaraderie! Together! That's the way, it's ought to be! Together! Just you, and you, and you--♪
,SpongeBob:, ♪--and you--♪
,SpongeBob, Patrick & Prisoners:, ♪--and me! Together! Togeeeetttthhhher! Together!♪
,[Curtain goes down, and the show ends. Warden and the guards are now clapping and screaming with joy. One of them is throwing roses at the stage. Warden starts to cry],
,Warden:, I-I-I had never seen anything so beautiful... ,[hugs the guards],
,Prisoner #2:, Okay, let's do it! ,[They start to sail away],
,SpongeBob:, Uh... Hey, guys! What are you doing?
,Prisoner #2:, We're breaking out of here, yeah, that's what! Escapin'! Oh, uh, thanks for the convincin' stage craft! ,[They start to sail away. Warden and the guards are seen again and are still clapping],
,Warden:, Encore! Encore! Encore! Do it again! ,[Curtain raises by itself, revealing the boat is gone, and SpongeBob and Patrick are standing there, all by themselves], What the?! ,[The boat starts to sink, as they sail away],
,Prisoner #2:, Turn the ship around! ,[other prisoners starts turning the ship. We then notice that the boat isn't complete, as it only had one side. The ship sinks.],
,Prisoners:, ,[drowning], Help! Somebody save our lives! We can't swim! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick bow. Cuts to all of them standing in line, all wet. We see the Warden walking back and forth],
,Warden:, I'm stuffed. I can't even begin to imagine a punishment appropriate for what has happened here tonigh'! Bert cannot attempt to describe the disgusting, vile, th-th-the complete disregard for the story tradition of musical theatre. So, startin' this very moment, every one of you will be sentenced to...
,Camp Counselor:, Ahoy! ,[Warden turns around and sees him through his binocular], Hello? Yoo-who?
,Warden:, What in the name of... ,[The Camp Counselor goes up on the deck, and coughs for swimming hard], For Neptune's sake man, speak the King's English!
,Camp Counselor:, I'm... I'm Camp Counselor Kraus from Sun Fun Island!
,Warden:, Your who-what?
,Camp Counselor:, Well, I was doing roll call and discovered one of my Sun-funners was missing! I came to take him back with me. A-e SpongeBob-eh SquarePants? ,[Prisoners then get an idea, and pretend to be SpongeBob],
,Warden:, Enough. So tell me Counselor, just what do they do on your Sunny Funny Island?
,Camp Counselor:, Well, we uh make macaroni art...
,Warden:, Egad.
,Camp Counselor:, And we sing campfire songs!
,Warden:, Ahck!
,Camp Counselor:, Oh and we help and support each other. ,[Warden's head explodes with scary thoughts],
,Warden:, These heinous activities sound like torture too severe for even the lowest, filthiest, undeserving... ,[He gets an idea], Wait a minute! I have a brilliant idea! ,[We now see plates with glue and macaroni on them. The prisoners are making noises in response to what they're doing. They hate it. Prisoner #4 made a smiley face out of it.'],
,Camp Counselor:, ,[to Prisoner #6], Oh, that is very good, Bruiser! ,[We see others complaining and crying. SpongeBob and Patrick sigh],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Patrick? / SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, You first.
,Patrick:, I... I like the other island better!
,SpongeBob:, Me too! ,[Both start crying uncontrollably],

,Mr. Krabs:, Well, good night, folks. Come again. ,[flips the ""Open"" sign around to say ""Closed""], Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[washing plates], There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[enters kitchen], Time to pack it in, Sponge- Bah! Wha?! ,[sees a spot on a plate],
,SpongeBob:, All ready, Mr. Krabs. ,[he takes his hairnet off], Just gotta clock out and...
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this? ,[SpongeBob inspects the plate and then notices the spot],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Spot, spot, spot!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till...
,SpongeBob:, ...till everything's ship-shape, sir. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done.
,SpongeBob:, Lock up? Wait, Mr. Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone? ,[flashback to Krusty Krab on fire],
,Mr. Krabs:, Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work.
,SpongeBob:, Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. ,[washes the plate but the spot is still on there], You're a tough little guy, aren't ya? ,[tries to clean it some more, creating steam through friction, but it's not coming off], This means war. ,[cut to SpongeBob trying to use a jackhammer, but fails and repeatedly get hit in the face with it. He is then seen using a bat and bangs the plate with it, and then a chainsaw to get it off by banging it on the plate, but nothing's working], Wait here, please. ,[goes off and comes back riding a T-34 Tank, smashing through a safety poster featuring Mr. Krabs], Say good-night, dried on filth. Ready. Aim. Fire! ,[shoots a pink sponge onto the plate then checks to see if the spot is gone and it's not. He is frustrated], That is the last straw! I want you to remember... ,[crying], you made me do this. ,[spits on it and tries to rub it out but nothing happens], Yaahhhh! ,[""drops plate semi-gently""], I got to finish this. ,[cut to SpongeBob in an army-like outfit. He speaks worth an accent], I'm afraid this is the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the Spot-Master 6000. ,[a water-gun laser], Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials. ,[soap, mop, bucket, and other materials are combined with it], I call it... ,[pushes a button to show a ball of wool], ...steel wool! And it comes with... ,[a laser pops out of the wool ball], a laser! Any last words? ,[he puts his ear near the plate], Mmm... I thought not. ,[he jumps into the seat and puts on goggles], Power up. ,[we see a Krabby Patty at first and then a green laser the spot], Water cannon... on. ,[turns it on, a water laser is shooting at the plate.], No effect. Steel wool laser... on! ,[Turns it on. As the Krusty Krab shakes, lights are shining out of it and Mr. Krabs can see it from his home],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmmm... strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob. ,[he walks away, and the scene cuts back to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, OK, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it, but I am crossing the beams! ,[he crosses the beams], More power! ,[does so, and it sends out 'sound'-like waves through the air, causing everything to look like it's wiggling. Mr. Krabs checks out his window],
,Mr. Krabs:, Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to.
,SpongeBob:, More power!

,SpongeBob:, More power!
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's see what he's done this time. ,[puts the key in the lock],
,SpongeBob:, Maximum power! Ahhhhh! ,[pushes on maximum power. A huge blast wrecks the restaurant and a bursting size of an atomic bomb, which is actually a clip from Operation Crossroad occurs. We now see the restaurant completely destroyed and then the Spot-Master 6000 disintegrates],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, this time you've done it, boy. What've you got to say for yourself?

,Sea Chicken:, ,[on TV], It's im-peck-able! ,[squawks], So come on down to my Sea Chicken Shack, and don't forget the kids. ,[four kids come up to him and hang on him],
,Mr. Krabs:, Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr. Sea Chicken. There goes me monopoly. But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast? SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'.
,SpongeBob:, You want me to go undercover?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers.
,SpongeBob:, Understood, Mr. Krabs. ,[raises his arm and takes a picture with his armpit], How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, I don't need a spy.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?
,Mr. Krabs:, Right.
,SpongeBob:, Well, you'd be mistaken, sir, because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Boy, stop this nonsense!
,SpongeBob:, You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone. ,[cut to Sea Chicken Shack where SpongeBob is in disguise], Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red.
,Mr. Krabs:, Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax. ,[customer sits on a chair, but it collapses], And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon.
,Charlie:, ,[drenching in sweat after running a marathon], Oh, so it's a crime now to exercise.

,SpongeBob:, I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample.

Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort! ,[employees throw SpongeBob out], Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel.
,Mr. Krabs:, Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?
,SpongeBob:, Other than the faux dilapidation, not really.
,Mr. Krabs:, What you're describin' is an absolute dump. Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?
,SpongeBob:, No. Great Barrier Reef!
,Mr. Krabs:, What is it, lad? What do you see?
,SpongeBob:, I see a huge statue depicting Mr. Sea Chicken and all his glory! ,[a bunch of kids are climbing on the giant statue],
,Mr. Krabs:, A statue? How does a statue steal me customers? ,[static on other end of radio], SpongeBob? SpongeBob? ,[he's taken his wristband radio off and is now climbing on the giant chicken statue], Of course, Mr. Sea Chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foll-er. ,[cut to later at Krusty Krab], Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet.

,Mr. Krabs:, My mom?
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Mr. Krabs:, Then who?
,Squidward:, For the love of all things briny, it's me!
,SpongeBob:, Correct.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo.
,Squidward:, For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius.
,SpongeBob:, Word.
,Squidward:, Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. Goodbye.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr. Squidward. You and I aren't that different from each other. We both ""make product.""
,Squidward:, Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?
,Squidward:, Oh, I don't know, 12?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday.
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], All right, Krabs, I'll do it. But I will need complete artistic control.
,Mr. Krabs:, You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow.
,Squidward:, Yes, tom—tomorrow!
,Mr. Krabs:, As advertised.
,Squidward:, I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, If you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 8:00am.
,Squidward:, I'll need an assistant.
,Mr. Krabs:, Here you go. ,[SpongeBob is Squidward's assistant],
,Squidward:, Fine. The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece.
,SpongeBob:, Anything for the artiste.
,Squidward:, And don't dilly... ,[SpongeBob pushes a giant stone into the Krusty Krab], ...dally. Nice rock.
,SpongeBob:, Isn't it? I can't believe no one was using it. ,[SpongeBob took the rock from a museum, which collapses from not having the rock],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm gonna be rich!
,Squidward:, I'm gonna be famous!
,SpongeBob:, I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher! ,[cut to later where Mr. Krabs is posing for Squidward],
,Squidward:, Prepare to be immortalized in stone.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm...shy.
,Squidward:, I am posing you! Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself? ,[shot of Mr. Krabs from behind], Don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in? ,[Mr. Krabs drops the towel],
,Mr. Krabs:, Like this?
,Squidward:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Or this? ,[poses with a bow and arrow],
,Squidward:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Or this? ,[poses with a golden discus],
,Squidward:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Or this? ,[poses as The Thinker],
,Squidward:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, come on, Squidward. ,[sniffs his armpits],
,Squidward:, Mm. ,[gets an idea], Hold that pose! Don't move a muscle. ,[chuckles],
,Mr. Krabs:, How long am I gonna have to stay like this?
,Squidward:, As long as it takes. ,[Squidward uses various tools for sculpting. SpongeBob poses for a bit but Squidward sends him away. Mr. Krabs grows tired of the post, but SpongeBob helps him out by putting a spoon and fork under his arms to help them stay up. Cut to next morning where Squidward gets finished with the sculpture and sighs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!
,Squidward:, All done. ,[the spoon and fork break into pieces and Mr. Krab's left arm snaps],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, let's see it!
,Squidward:, Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, yeah, just show me. ,[Squidward pulls back the curtain],
,Squidward:, Voila! ,[Mr. Krabs frowns after looking it, then shatters into pieces],
,Mr. Krabs:, What's that supposed to be?
,Squidward:, This is a masterpiece.
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't have a mouth in my stomach!
,Squidward:, It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all. I call it Mopression.
,Mr. Krabs:, Whatever that means. But is it safe for kids to play on?
,Squidward:, This is art, not a swing set!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it. SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Reporting for duty, sir!
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy.
,Squidward:, It is not a doohickey, it's art!
,SpongeBob:, I read you loud and clear, captain. Loud and clear. ,[swings on the statue's nose and it falls on top of him], Wow, this is heavy.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! I can't let kids play on that—that—that weapon! I'm gonna get my pants sued off!
,Squidward:, What, you wanted a piece or art and that's what you got.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, it's a piece all right, a piece of junk!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea.
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you hear something? ,[cut to Mr. Krabs being painted golden and having kids climb on him], Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?
,Squidward:, As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties. ,[Mr. Krabs groans],
,SpongeBob:, I think you look really good, sir. You're golden! ,[laughs],

"[At the Krusty Krab, we see SpongeBob coming out of the freezer with a Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, Nothing like a fresh frozen Krabby Patty with extra freezer burn flavor. ,[His nose breaks off. He walks up to the grill], Here we go... ,[Interrupts himself of the sight of the filthy grill. He takes his finger and observes part of the filth], Hmm, grill look a tad dirty. ,[Cuts to the counter with a customer],
,Customer:, Yeah, I like to order...,[Gets interrupted by a noise from the kitchen],
,Squidward:, Hold that thought. ,[SpongeBob is cleaning the grill with a red sponge. Squidward pops his head in the window], SpongeBob, what is all that r... ,[SpongeBob cleans Squidward's face, he goes back to the counter with his face all dirty],
,Customer:, Uh, so I like to order... ,[Squidward closes his mouth, hushing him. Back in the kitchen, the grill is all cleaned. SpongeBob places the red sponge in his tongue],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Pops his head out the window], Say! Who wants...the first patty from our freshly cleaned grill?! ,[Hyperventilates excitedly],
,Customer:, ,[Delighted], I would like a Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, Okay! How about you, Squid-
,Squidward:, No! I do not want a Krabby Patty!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Touching Squidward’s nose], You suuure?
,Squidward:, Don't touch me.
,Customer:, Why don't you want a Krabby Patty?
,Squidward:, I've seen what he cleans the grill with. ,[Cuts to the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Now all I need is a fresh patty. ,[Walks to the freezer and screams when he is slipping on water. Out the door, he made a path of water, grabs a pole, and slides back to the kitchen continues screaming, closing the door. He is now lying down],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, where'd all this water come from? ,[He noticed the sink was running. He walks up to it and turns it off], There we go. Oh my stars and garters, the sink is clogged up. ,[He places a ""Wet Floor"" sign], Safety. ,[Walks back to the sink], Now what seem to be the trouble? ,[He heard somebody tripped. SpongeBob walks up to that person, which was Patrick], Patrick, what happened? ,[Patrick sits up],
,Patrick:, There I was, walking along, just minding my own business and then BOOM! ,[Takes out the ""Wet Floor"" sign], Some dumbbell put this thing in the way. ,[Throws the sign out and gets up], Whatcha doing?
,SpongeBob:, Trying to see what has this sink all backed up. Would you excuse me a second?
,Patrick:, Uh-huh. ,[SpongeBob inhales for breath and holds it. He dives his head into the sink and then he saw a drain plug],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Gurgling], Ah-ha! ,[Takes his head out of the sink], Oh, this is easy. All I have to do is pull the drain plug. ,[Repeating as the scene goes to Mr. Krabs' office while he is writing], Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. Pull the drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug. The drain plug.,[Mr. Krabs' eyes are bloodshot in fright], The drain plug.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Frighten], The drain plug?! ,[Cuts to SpongeBob, trying to pull the drain plug. Mr. Krabs rushed to SpongeBob], SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob gets startled and he jumps up to the ceiling, hitting his head. Then he falls down to the floor], What in Neptune's bathtub do you think you're doing, lad?
,SpongeBob:, The sink is clogged, so I was going to pull out the drain plug. ,[Mr. Krabs smacks his hand],
,Mr. Krabs:, Stop messing with that drain plug! Are you daft?
,SpongeBob:, Why don't you want me to pull out the drain plug, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr Krabs:, Why don't I, but...hmm...one sec. ,[Walks to a light switch and turns it off. Then he walks back], Time for a scary story, boys. The story...,[Takes out a flashlight and shines to his face],...,[Spooky tone],of the Main Drain. ,[He hears ominous music from Patrick's radio], Patrick.
,Patrick:, Sorry. ,[Turns off his radio],
,Mr. Krabs:, As I was saying... ,[Takes out the flashlight and shines to his face again], It happened a long time ago... ,[He hears ominous music from Patrick's radio again], Patrick! ,[Patrick turns it off again], ...to a pair of little kids.
,Patrick:, ,[Scared], Two little kids? ,[Crying],
,Mr. Krabs:, Anyway, ,[Takes out the flashlight and shines to his face again], it said that the Main Drain beckoned to them, putting them under its spell. ,[A flashback appears. In it, we see two kids, an orange fish and a green fish, running and laughing],
,Green Kid:, ♪Dadadada-dum-da-dumdumdum.♪
,Orange Kid:, Whooooo.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Narrating], One day, those two kids were wandering through the ocean, when they stumble upon it. ,[The kids found a giant drain plug],
,Kids:, Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Spooky tone], The Main Drain.
,Kids:, ,[They laughed together and then they are about to pull it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Legend has it that their curiosity got the best of 'em. ,[The kids pulled the plug and tossed it into the air], And they pulled the plug. ,[A white tornado sucked the orange kid in], The entire ocean rusted in the drain and sucked those two kids right down. ,[The green kid escapes by running away, and then the tornado sucked the green kid but gets stuck and then, white arms pushes the green kid in], The drain was so powerful, it pulled all of Bikini Bottom into its gaping maw, causing an apocalypse to the sea! ,[The drain sucked everything in the ocean, including the water. As the flashback ends, we fade back to Mr. Krabs], And nobody was ever heard from...again.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Turns the light back on], Where is the Main Drain, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it right, I...I don't know where it is, and I'm certainly not going to tell you. ,[Pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of the restaurant], So, so, so get out of here and stay away from that drain! No plugs will be pulled on my watch. ,[Closes the door],
,Patrick:, Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of baggage about drain dealies.
,SpongeBob:, The Main Drain sounds very, very dangerous. I'm never gonna go near that thing.
,Patrick:, We should go find it! To protect it from people like us.
,SpongeBob:, What if we get sucked in like those other two kids!
,Patrick:, Ohh, don't worry, we're not little kids. We're all grown up! ,[pulls his tooth out], Hey! A baby tooth!
,SpongeBob:, Who's been at Bikini Bottom for as long as Mr. Krabs?
,[The two hear a crunching sound, as SpongeBob has just stepped on Plankton],
,Plankton:, Ow!
,Patrick:, Ew.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Looks at shoe and sees squished Plankton], Oh, Hi, Plankton!
,[SpongeBob peels him off of his shoe, taking off skin],
,Plankton:, Ow!
,Patrick:, Let's ask Plankton. He's a geezer.
,Plankton:, What stupid question do you want the answer to? Idiots.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, and I are trying to find the Main Drain
,Plankton:, ,[gasps], The Main Drain? What are you to bothering me for? I mean I-I don't know where the Main Drain is. It's a myth anyway, it doesn't exist.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but Mr. Krabs said-
,Plankton:, Krabs?! Why that- Well, he was just telling you a fish tail. There's no such thing as a Drain at the bottom of the sea. So go on, scram, shoe, get outta here!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk away],
,Plankton:, Why on earth would Krabs tell those two blunderers about the Main Drain?
,[Cuts to downtown Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob and Patrick are walking],
,SpongeBob:, I wonder who else knows about the Main Drain...
,[Old Man Jenkins pulls SpongeBob and Patrick in his house],
,Both:, ,[shocked], Old Man Jenkins!
,Old Man Jenkins:, Why are you two asking about the Main Drain?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs told us a story of how the Main Drain once destroyed Bikini Bottom.
,Patrick:, So we've been looking for it!
,SpongeBob:, Does the Main Drain even exist?
,Old Man Jenkins:, Oh, it exists alright. But it's been, uh, ,[whispers], hushed up.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], Where is the Drain, o wise Jenkins?
,Old Man Jenkins:, I have no idea.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of his house],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! We need to find that Drain!
,Patrick:, Why?
,SpongeBob:, Isn't your curiosity piqued? What if somebody accidentally pulls it? What if- What if-
,Patrick:, ,[SpongeBob: blah blah blah blah blah. in his mind], Oh, man, I hope this question’s not for me. I hate questions.
,SpongeBob:, What do you think, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Dah-uhhh! 42. No, triangle! Meatballs! Screwdrivers! Pajamas! ,[starts crying],
,SpongeBob:, I hear ya, Patrick! Let's go find that Main Drain!
,Patrick:, Okay.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick pack to go on a trip],
,SpongeBob:, Let's start walkin'
,Patrick:, Oh, no thanks. I'm not into the whole walking thing.
,SpongeBob:, But, Patrick, how are we gonna get to the center of the ocean?
,Patrick:, Wait for it to come to us.
,SpongeBob:, Hmmmm...I have a better idea! ,[blows a bubble of a bus], Well, what do you think?
,Patrick:, I love it!
,Both:, ,[laughs], Road trip! Whoo! ,[bubble pops and they fall],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's out.
,Both:, Hmmmm...
,SpongeBob:, I know! ,[blows another bubble of six large balloons. SpongeBob and Patrick set them up on Patrick's rock. They float away. Many clams acted liked birds come bye and pop all of the bubble balloons],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[they and the rock plummet while the both of them scream], Aah!
,Squidward:, ,[walking], Another miserable day... ,[sighs. The rock falls on Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Ohh. How are we gonna find the center of the ocean now?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hmmmmm...
,Patrick:, Oh! Oh! I know exactly what to do! ,[grabs rope of the rock and bites it], NEEIIGGHH ,[begins crawling slowly],
,Squidward:, Owwwwwww. That's better...
,[Patrick continues to pull the rock. getting faster],
,SpongeBob:, Doin' great, Patrick! We'll be there in no time!
,Patrick:, ,[runs into something and hits it], Owww. Oh. ,[rubbing his head. It was the Main Plug], Huh, I found it!
,SpongeBob:, Wow. Good job...
,Patrick:, Let's pull it.
,SpongeBob:, What?! Why would we do that?!
,Patrick:, Well, that was the whole point of coming here right?
,SpongeBob:, No! We came to see if it was real!
,Patrick:, Well, how do we know if this one is a fake?
,SpongeBob:, We- We don't know...
,Patrick:, We won't know unless we pull it!
,SpongeBob:, But...if we pull it, and if it's real, the world may end!
,Patrick:, And if we don't, we'll never know...
,[The camera changes back and forth between shots of SpongeBob's scared face and shots of Patrick reaching for the handle until Mr. Krabs and Plankton stopped them],
,Both:, No!
,Mr. Krabs:, Boys, there's more to that story about the Drain! You see...
,Plankton:, We were the two ding-a-lings who pulled that plug.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[gasp],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right one day, Plankton and I were wandering around.
,[Another flashback appears which was almost the same as Mr. Krabs' first story],
,Young Krabs and Plankton:, ,[running and laughing], Huh? ,[finds the Drain. laughed together. both pull the Drain and thrower it into the air],
,Young Plankton:, ,[screams while the same white tornado sucked him in],
,Young Krabs:,  ,[runs away to escape], Mother of pearl! ,[the tornado sucked him into the drain as well. All of Bikini Bottom and the water gets sucked into the Drain. Fade back to Mr. Krabs and Plankton],
,Mr. Krabs:, You see, we had to lie to keep you from lookin' for it.
,Plankton:, We just didn't want you to make the same mistake we made.
,SpongeBob:, Pheeeww. That was a close one...
,Patrick:, Yeah, We almost messed up big time. Pheeeww. ,[accidentally pulls the drain, and then the same white tornado from Mr. Krabs' story appears],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[notices the tornado sucked everything from Bikini Bottom],
,SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and Plankton:, ,[all screaming, running away together, but leaving Patrick behind],
,Patrick:, ,[screaming while still seeing the drain, then runs away, heading for SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton, but all four of them are about to get sucked into the drain, but they get stuck. Then, they slowly got pushed into the drain and they got sucked in the drain followed by four tall blue houses, the rest of the Bikni Bottom and the rest of the Bikini Bottomites],
,Bikini Bottomies:, ,[screaming while spinning into a big black hole and they disappear.], ,[Patrick sits up in bed],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], It's the most realistic story I've ever heard! ,[hears the water sucked into the sink],

"[The episode starts with a live-action shot of Big Ben in London. As ""Rule, Britannia"" plays, the time on the clock changes to 9 o'clock and it starts chiming. The camera zooms out suddenly, revealing that it is only Squidward's watch.],
,Squidward:, Wow, I'm really late again. Maybe they'll finally fire me. ,[laughs as he walks into the closed front doors of the Krusty Krab], Locked?
,SpongeBob:, ,[lying in a fetal position against the front doors, knocking his head on them], This isn't happening. This isn't happening!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, The horror, it's unspeakable! ,[grabs Squidward], Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed!
,Squidward:, You mean I got out of bed for nothing?
,SpongeBob:, The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone. ,[presses his face into the glass],
,Mr. Krabs:, Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door.

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sarcastically], No. I'm just doubled over in pain, fightin' back tears in me eyes because it's a new dance craze! ,[wiggles his claws from side to side like he's dancing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[naively],Oh good, I thought you were hurt.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shouting], I am hurt, ya idiot! ,[SpongeBob's lip quivers], I'm sorry I snapped at ya, laddie. It's just me back is killing me. It's me old, lumpy mattress. It's like trying to sleep on broken coral. I'm going out of me mind. ,[back breaks again], Oh, me back.

,Mr. Krabs:, Armageddon! What? Oh, you? What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?
,SpongeBob:, We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress.

,Patrick:, ,[talking to SpongeBob], I thought it was your idea.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[through gritted teeth], So, where's me old mattress then? ,[fury goes up],
,Squidward:, Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[jumps on Squidward], All my money was in that mattress!
,Squidward:, What?! Haven't you ever heard of a bank?!
,Mr. Krabs:, No! ,[walks backward, hits his lamp and trashes some books],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, No! ,[faints],

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[lifts one eye up off the floor], Is there money in it?
,Patrick:, ,[shakes the envelope], Nope. ,[Mr. Krabs faints again. Later, at the hospital],
,SpongeBob:, Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?
,Doctor:, Mr. Krabs is in a cash-coma. Only the return of his money can save his life.
,Squidward:, It was SpongeBob's fault! Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea!
,Patrick:, ,[firmly], I knew it!
,Police Officer:, Not so fast! ,[holds up get well card], This card says ""This was all my idea. Love, Squidward."" If Mr. Krabs doesn't pull through, you're going to jail.
,Squidward:, ,[gets really angry at SpongeBob], Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd... ,[officer clears his throat], ...,[nervously], help you do it myself.
,Patrick:, Wow, he really does care. ,[later at the dump],
,Patrick:, What a dump.

,Patrick:, ,[looks through the gate], Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?
,SpongeBob:, Terrific, Patrick, you found it!
,Squidward:, What? Where? Lemme see. Where?
,SpongeBob:, Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm.
,Squidward:, Oh, that figures. ,[later at the hospital],
,Doctor:, Oh no, this is horrible.
,Nurse:, What is it, doctor?
,Doctor:, This man has no insurance.
,Nurse:, He'll never be able to afford this room!
,Doctor:, You're right, nurse. Extract the patient to the hallway. Stat! ,[Mr. Krabs is pushed into a snack machine while he groans],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it.
,Squidward:, Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm.
,Patrick:, ,[confused], Why not?
,SpongeBob:, ,[frankly], Because that would be rude, Patrick.
,Squidward:, And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick get scared at hearing this revelation],
,Patrick:, ,[crossly], Hey, wait a minute, what are ,you, gonna do?
,Squidward:, ,[lying], Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe.
,Patrick:, ,[naïvely], Gee, thanks, buddy.
,Squidward:, My pleasure. Now let's get a move on. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Patrick climbs the fence], Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here.
,Patrick:, Wow. ,[both sigh],
,Squidward:, ,[angry], What are you morons doing?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here.
,Patrick:, Where? I can't see them. ,[fence flips around to where Squidward is inside and SpongeBob & Patrick are outside.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Wow. ,[both laugh],
,Patrick:, Let's do it again. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick continue laughing],
,Squidward:, What did you idiots do?!
,Patrick:, Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too!
,Squidward:, I didn't do it! You blockheads woke... ,[the guard worm emerges from behind Squidward growling], the... worm. ,[screams in pain as the worm attacks him while Patrick and SpongeBob are horrified at the sight. Later at the hospital],
,Doctor #2:, Doctor?
,Doctor #1:, Yes, doctor?
,Doctor #2:, Regarding your patient, doctor. I have come to this conclusion.
,Doctor #1:, Yes, go on.
,Doctor #2:, We have to surgically remove him out from in front of the candy machine so I can get to the nutty nut bar.
,Doctor #1:, Of course. Nurse?
,Nurse:, I'm on it. ,[wheels Mr. Krabs outside the hospital while he groans again. Later at the dump],
,SpongeBob:, ,[climbing down a rope with Patrick to get inside the gate], Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out.
,Squidward:, Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out.
,SpongeBob:, Understood. Out.
,Squidward:, No! In! Out.
,SpongeBob:, Understood. Out.
,Squidward:, Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?
,SpongeBob:, Affirmative.
,Squidward:, Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it.
,SpongeBob:, Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'.
,Patrick:, Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'
,SpongeBob:, I dunno. ,[ululating with Patrick], Great idea, Patrick! ,[they both use pots and pans to make loud noises that draw the guard worm away],
,Squidward:, And my perfect plan falls into place. ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, ,[continues ululating with SpongeBob], Uh, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I think I know why our code name is ""Worm-bait"". ,[guard worm rushes up and growls at them both until it notices the wooden spoon in SpongeBob's hand],
,SpongeBob:, Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm. ,[worms eyes turn into an image of the wooden spoon. Then, he behaves like a good dog wanting to play],
,Patrick:, Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob raises the spoon then lowers the spoon as the worm's eyes follow where the spoon is], Wow, I think you're right, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[clapping], See if he plays catch.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, see the stick, boy? ,[throws spoon], Go get it, boy! ,[worm chases after spoon],
,Squidward:, Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius. ,[wooden spoon hits Squidward in the head], Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket. ,[places spoon in back pocket], And now for the mattress. ,[worm bites Squidward in the butt], I should've guessed. ,[worm attacks Squidward. Back at the hospital],
,Administrator Flotsam:, Excuse me, doctor.
,Doctor:, Administrator Flotsam, what can I do for you?
,Administrator Flotsam:, It has come to my attention that your patient, Mr. Krabs, is outside on the front sidewalk.
,Doctor:, Yes, yes he is.
,Administrator Flotsam:, What were you thinking, man? We're trying to run a business. We can't leave patients on the sidewalk.
,Doctor:, Not to worry. Nurse!
,Nurse:, I'm on it. ,[pushes Mr. Krabs away from the hospital and down a hill. Back at the dump, dawn is breaking],
,Squidward:, Alright, you two, what's the holdup?
,SpongeBob:, We feel silly.
,Squidward:, Come on, do it for old man Krabs.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick jump out of the portable potty in steak costumes], Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Sure, but first, put on this cologne.
,SpongeBob:, ,[reads label], Steak sauce? ,[shrugs his shoulders and puts the sauces on his body],
,Squidward:, Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell ""Trick or treat!"" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress.
,Patrick:, Gimme that cologne. ,[Patrick puts the sauce on his body],
,Squidward:, Now get in there!
,SpongeBob:, Happy Halloween, Squidward!
,Squidward:, I am not going to get hurt this time. ,[hears some rattling in the distance. It's Mr. Krabs on his hospital bed rolling down the street into the dump], Isn't that Mr. Krabs? ,[screams as Mr. Krabs runs over Squidward, crashes through the gate, and runs into a rock, causing the bed to flip him over in front of his mattress. Guard worm growls],
,Patrick:, That guard worm doesn't look very happy.
,SpongeBob:, Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffs around and recovers], It's... me money! ,[guard worm snarls as Mr. Krabs roars like a lion and sends the worm into the air and off the mattress], Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. Krabs. ,[Mr. Krabs jumps on his mattress and barks ferociously], No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!
,Patrick:, Trick or treat.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed as meat?
,SpongeBob:, Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Oh, I give up. ,[guard worm lands in Squidward's arms snarling at him. Squidward runs off as the worm chases him], Ahhh! Get away!

"[The episode begins with Plankton vandalizing the Krusty Krab with red paint.],
,Plankton:, ,[cackling], Yes! My plan is working! ,[throws away paint brush and throws a bucket full of paint at the restaurant's windows], Now everyone in town will know what a jerk Krabs is. Yeah! ,[the scene pans out to reveal that he drew pictures of Mr. Krabs and wrote threatening messages all over the restaurant and all of Bikini Bottom; as he laughs evilly, a police woman comes in and handcuffs him], Huh?
,Lady officer:, Hey, you! ,[pokes him with her batting stick], You're under arrest.
,Plankton:, Arrest? For what? I didn't even steal anything this time.
,Mr. Krabs:, Vandalism's a crime too. You've been caught red-handed, Plankton.
,Plankton:, Eh, should've used the green paint.
,Mr. Krabs:, I usually laugh all the way to the bank. ,[rubs Plankton's cheeks], But for you Plankton, I'll laugh all the way to the clink! ,[laughs as he escorts the cop to the Bikini Bottom Jail where she will lock up Plankton],
,Lady officer:, Oh no, the prison is full! ,[the scene shows Bikini Bottom Jail completely overcrowded with criminals], Looks like we'll just have to set you free.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[his jaw dropped in shock], What, free?! But he's a criminal!
,Lady officer:, Well, you know what they say. Don't stop the crime if you can't enforce the time.
,Plankton:, ,[laughs as he escapes the handcuff's clutches], Eat it, Krabs! I'm off to re-offend. ,[leaves with a paint brush],
,Lady officer:, It's a shame that there's no other place in Bikini Bottom to hold our extra criminals. 'Cause we'd give that place a lot of money. ,[holds out a pile of money],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[giggles as his head changes into a gold coin; he shakes the officer's hand], You got yourself a deal! ,[stomps on Plankton so he wouldn't escape], We can lock him up at my place, ,[pulls Plankton back], the Krusty Krab.
,Lady officer:, Well then, ,[holds up a shackle with an iron ball], this is for the prisoner. ,[crushes Plankton with the iron ball], And here's your cash. ,[hands Mr. Krabs the pile of money],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Whoa. ,[giggles as he takes the money pile and makes a coat out of them; he puts on his money coat], Thank you, Madame Officer.
,[Mr. Krabs takes the iron ball and rolls Plankton over to the Krusty Krab. Meanwhile, Squidward is busy scraping gum off under one of the tables.],
,Squidward:, Oh, stupid barnacles, tartar sauce, fish paste—
,[The iron ball rolls through the front doors and flies into Squidward's face. Squidward, in form of bowling pins, is sent flying over to the register boat.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cackles], Enjoy your ride, Plankton? ,[steps on Squidward's hand],
,Squidward:, Ow.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Oh, sorry, Mr. Squidward. Didn't see you there.
,[The iron ball falls on Squidward and crushes his head.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what's Plankton doing here, Mr. Krabs? I thought he was going to prison. ,[lifts the iron ball off of Squidward],
,Mr. Krabs:, He is. The Krusty Krab is a prison now. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in a prisoner outfit while holding Plankton and a pennant that reads ""Prison""], Oh, hooray! Prison!
,Squidward:, ,[blows air back into his head], Oh, big deal. I've been a prisoner here for years.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[plugs a plunger in Squidward's face], Hardy-har, Mr. Squidward. ,[gives SpongeBob a bucket of cleaning supplies], You boys get back to work! ,[grabs Plankton], I'll be guarding Plankton in me office. ,[cuts to Mr. Krabs putting Plankton in a birdcage in his office], Into your cell, you miscreant! ,[places Plankton in the cage and crushes him with his iron ball],
,Plankton:, ,[shakes his head to pull himself together], All right, I'm out of here. ,[hops on the iron ball], Uh, pardon me, warden, sir, but is that a pretty penny on the floor?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[rips his magazine and hops off his desk], Where? It's mine! It's mine! I saw it first! ,[searches the floor for the ""penny""],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs as escapes the birdcage and heads for the door], The perfect escape. ,[all of a sudden, he gets clamped by a foothold trap set up by Mr. Krabs], YEEOOWW!!! ,[struggles to break free, but is lifted up by Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no you don't. ,[blows air into Plankton to straighten him out], Trying to escape is bad enough. But lying about a penny? You're going in ,[through his eyelids], the hole. ,[goes over to SpongeBob, who is washing the register boat with part of his spongy body], Need one of your holes, boy-o.
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts his spongy body part back in place and takes off his hat], You got it, Warden Krabs.
,Plankton:, Hey, let's not do anything we can't— ,[gets dropped into SpongeBob's body by Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, And don't let him go nowhere!

,Plankton:, ,[inside SpongeBob's body], All right, who turned off the lights? ,[pounds inside SpongeBob's body],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Sorry, sir. Plankton tickles inside of me. ,[giggles],
,Mr. Krabs:, That ought to learn him.
,Lady officer:, Morning, Warden.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, me favorite paying police lady. Here to give me more money?
,Lady officer:, Yup, more money for more prisoners.
,Mr. Krabs:, More prisoners?
,[A prison truck pulls over and drops off a group of prisoners.],
,Prisoner #1:, Aye, the Krusty Krab. I used to eat here.
,Prisoner #2:, What a coincidence. I used to rob here.
,[As prisoners line up, a pile of money is given to Mr. Krabs by the police woman.],
,Lady officer:, So, what do you say, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs wildly and takes the money], I say lock 'em up! ,[picks up some money he dropped as the police woman leaves], SpongeBob! Try to prison-up the place for our new guests. I gotta go incarcerate all this cash. ,[giggles as he enters his office],
,SpongeBob:, I'll do my best, Warden Krabs, sir!
,[SpongeBob goes to redecorate the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs picks up some money he dropped outside his office. The scene changes SpongeBob wearing a police hat and a badge while holding the keys. He is walking around and singing to himself. Moments later, Mr. Krabs comes out and takes a look at the Krusty Krab. The restaurant is now redesigned with prison cells for prisoners to sleep in. The Krusty Krab is now dubbed the Krusty Slammer. As prisoners are in their cells, they watch the regular customers eat their meals.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[whistles], Nice work, boy-o. Very prison-y.
,Fred:, Hey, uh, what's with all the caged men in here? ,[a prisoner grabs him by the neck and chokes him], They're making me a little nervous.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, um, well we're a prison-themed restaurant now. ,[secretly makes something with a pencil], Do your time with our new Prison Patty. ,[holds up a Krabby Patty in a poorly drawn prison-themed box], It's served in a solitary confinement box, has its own prisoner number, and even comes with toy shackles! ,[holds up a plastic toy shackle],
,Fred:, Wow!
,Prisoner #3:, ,[chokes Fred really hard], Looks delicious.
,Mr. Krabs:, At the Krusty Krab, you can lock up your hunger and throw away your keys! ,[the customers chatter in delight], Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Ooh, crisis averted. Okay, time to let Plankton out of the hole. Open her up, boy-o. ,[SpongeBob removes his hat and unplugs his head], Hmm. ,[peaks in and sees Plankton becoming hysterical and is mentally going insane; Mr. Krabs reaches in SpongeBob's body and pulls Plankton out], Pull yourself together, prisoner! ,[slaps Plankton], I got a new cell for you.
,[Mr. Krabs takes Plankton back into his office, removes the secret formula from the bottle, and places him inside the bottle.],
,Plankton:, ,[sees the formula outside the bottle], The formula?! It's so close. I can almost touch it. No, no, no, no!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cackles], Good times. Good times.
,[The scene changes to nighttime at the Krusty Krab aka Krusty Slammer. The whole place is barricaded with barbwires and steel walls. A search light is shining all over to place to make sure that none of the prisoners escape. SpongeBob comes in with a cart full of mail for the prisoners.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, mail call, boys. Let's see, who do we have? ,[pulls out some letters], Toothy. ,[gives a letter to Reggie], Four Eyes. ,[gives a letter to a prisoner with four eyes], Lefty. ,[gives a letter to prisoner who is facing left], Fats. ,[gives a letter to a skinny prisoner], Fingers. ,[gives a letter to a prisoner with loads of fingers all over its body], Einstein. ,[gives a letter to a floating brain with a mustache; quickly reads off names while throwing letters at a fast pace], Stretch, Chuckles, Bingo, Blammy, Wheels, Boogie, Red, Trip, Winks, Skeeter, Stinky.
,Prisoners:, Thanks, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, No problem, guys.
,[SpongeBob rolls the mail cart away. Mr. Krabs is busy continuing his non-stop torture on Plankton. He spins Plankton up and down like a yo-yo. Then he paddles him back and forth like a paddle ball. Then he stretches him and uses him as a jump rope. Just then, the police woman comes in.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, morning, officer.
,Lady officer:, I'm here to oversee Plankton's release. ,[holds up Plankton's release form], His sentence is up.
,Mr. Krabs:, What? But I have so many more punishments for him.
,Plankton:, ,[laughs as the police woman leaves; he breaks free from Mr. Krabs' fist], Enjoy your Plankton-free prison, Eugene. ,[runs to the door], I hope it's worth what you're paying for it. ,[laughs as exits the restaurant/prison],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm? Paying for it? Wonder what he means by that. Huh?
,[Mr. Krabs sees Fred in a high-class cell. Fred is fluffing up his pillow and goes to sleep in a warm, comfy bed. Mr. Krabs wails in a shocking surprise. The Tattletale Strangler is seen with facial cream and cucumbers on his eye lids. He drinks some lemonade and goes back to relaxing. One prisoner is putting suntan lotion on another prisoner's back and gives him a massage. Squidward, in fancy clothing, serves a prisoner a plate full of Krabby Patties.],
,SpongeBob:, More marshmallows for your hot cocoa, Wobbles? ,[places marshmallows in a prisoner's mug of hot chocolate; in doing so, the drink forms into dollar signs and splashes back in the mug],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what are you doing?! ,[slaps SpongeBob's face with his tongue], Do you have any idea how much it costs to make a prison humane?! These down comforters, they're two-y. ,[rips a comforter off of Fred's bed, making him shiver], This ain't no luxury hotel! ,[rips the tube out of a prisoner's hot tub], These televisions ain't free! ,[rips a television off the wall], And neither are these massage chairs! ,[takes away the massage chair and replaces it with a barrel, making the prisoner cry like a baby], And this, your most expensive mistake of all! ,[takes Krabby Patties out of Stickyfins' and Dorsal Dan's mouths and stuffs them into the con man's mouth while reaching in his pocket and steals his money], From now on, no more patties for prisoners!
,[The prisoners are outraged at Mr. Krabs' cruel treatment and throws tomatoes at him in retaliation.],
,Dorsal Dan:, Cruel and unusual punishment!
,Mr. Krabs:, And no more tomatoes either!
,[During the riot, the tomatoes get flown into a customers' heads.],
,Female customer:, Come on, let's find another prison to eat at.
,Customers:, ,[as they exit the restaurant/prison in disgust], What a rip-off! Come on.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no! Come back! Come back! I can't afford to lose me paying customers. Oh, I'm ruined! ,[sobs], All right, that's it! ,[pushes a button on the remote and sets the prisoners free], No more prison! Everyone out! ,[pushes the prisoners out], Don't care where you go, but you can't stay here! ,[closes the door], Oh, finally. The Krusty Krab is back to being a regular old money-making restaurant. ,[giggles], Problem solved. ,[SpongeBob is about to say something against it, but Mr. Krabs cuts him off], I said problem solved! ,[throws SpongeBob out and heads back into his office in a confident smile],
,French Narrator:, Later at night...
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob's house. A group of strange creatures arrive and sneak inside. SpongeBob is sleeping in his bed and a shadow looms over him. SpongeBob wakes up and screams in fear as if he's seeing a monster. Eyes glow in the dark and surround SpongeBob. He turns on the light and sees that the creatures that came into his house are the prisoners Mr. Krabs kicked out earlier.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it's just my prison pals. What are you guys doing here?
,Prisoner #4:, We want to go back to the Krusty Krab. We were having fun in there with you. See? ,[shows a tattoo of himself hugging SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[out of sympathy], Aww. Okay, I'm in. Time for a jail-break-in.
,French Narrator:, The next day...
,[The scene changes the morning at the Krusty Slammer. Mr. Krabs enters the restaurant and prepares to open it for the day. When suddenly...],
,Prisoners:, Morning, Warden Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Morning, prisoners! ,[gasps in horror as he sees the prisoners back in their cells], SpongeBob! What is going on here? I set all these criminals free last night! What are they doing back in their cells?!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Mr. Krabs, now's probably not the best time to—
,[Too late. The police woman overheard everything Mr. Krabs said about releasing the prisoners the previous night, as he shrinks back in fear. She is seen sitting at a table eating her Krabby Patty.],
,Lady officer:, You know, it's a crime to release prisoners early, don't ya? ,[eats her patty and approaches Mr. Krabs who realizes his error], You're going to prison, ,[handcuffs Mr. Krabs], criminal.
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Oh, well, that's not so bad. Pencil me in for a 3:30 massage, SpongeBob.
,Lady officer:, ,[takes Mr. Krabs away], Oh, you're not staying here. The Krusty Krab is full. We got a new prison just for you.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sadly], Oh, no. Let me guess.
,[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket where Mr. Krabs is wearing his prison outfit and is placed in the same birdcage he used for Plankton. Mr. Krabs groans sadly.],
,Plankton:, Mealtime, prisoner! ,[laughs while throwing spoonfuls of raw chum in Mr. Krabs' face in an act of revenge for the all the painful torture he endured; Mr. Krabs cries in an agonizing defeat right before Plankton throws some chum into his mouth], Right in the mouth.

,Creepy sea creatures:, Patrick!

,[All of the creepy creatures grabs the Krabby Patties and goes to eat them. At first, things are going fine until they started to spit them out. It appears that none of the creatures like Krabby Patties at all.],
,Squidabeth:, What the devilish did you make?
,SpongeBob:, Well, Krabby Patties, of course.
,Squidabeth:, ,[gags], You tryin' to poison us?! ,[the customers throw their patties at SpongeBob], Quit fooling around and cook up something edible!

Oh, no!
,[SpongeBob goes to put the patties out, but gets blasted away by the flames. The Krabby Patties are now completely burned and are reduced to ashes. The patties are now transcended into smoke. Squidabeth comes in to see what was the noise and sees the smoke-shaped patties floating over the grill.],
,Squidabeth:, Oh, now, lookie here. Night patties! Now you're getting the swing of it.
,SpongeBob:, N-N-Night patties?

,Creepy sea creatures:, All right, Night Patties. Tasty. ,[they each grab a Night Patty and start to eat them],
,Unnamed creature:, ,[eats a Night Patty and ghostly smoke steams out from his nostrils], Smooth.
,[One creature eats the Night Patty and ghostly smoke steams out from his head. SpongeBob tries a Night Patty and ghostly smoke steams out from his holes.],
,SpongeBob:, Smoky.
,Creepy sea creatures:, ,[run over to SpongeBob and lift him up], Hooray! Yeah! Hip, hip, hooray!
,[Soon, everyone is enjoying the Night Patties SpongeBob made. Then all of a sudden, a ghostly fisherman bursts through the front door.],
,Fisherman:, Everybody down on the floor!
,Angler fish:, It's the Fisherman!
,[The creepy creatures scream and hide under the tables.],
,Two creatures:, No, not the Fisherman!
,Fisherman:, Now hand over the moola.
,[The creatures do exactly what the Fisherman says and drops money in his net. Squidabeth opens the cash register and the Fisherman takes the money. The Fisherman heads for the door until SpongeBob takes notice of him.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, good evening, sir. Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
,Fisherman:, Give me all your money!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm always glad to help a fellow out with a loan. ,[takes his wallet out and goes to give money to the Fisherman],
,Fisherman:, Loan? I don't want a loan. I'm the Fisherman! I'm robbing the place.
,SpongeBob:, Well, that is downright unfriendly. I'm putting you under fry cook's arrest. ,[holds out his license and onion ring handcuffs],
,Fisherman:, Huh? ,[holds out his fishing pole], Oh, really? ,[laughs],
,[The Fisherman throws his line and hooks SpongeBob by the pants. He then begins to reel him in like catching a fish. SpongeBob grabs onto a table and holds on for life. SpongeBob is then pulled back by the fishing line, but grabs another table. The Fisherman cackles and is about to catch SpongeBob with his line. But SpongeBob uses all his strength to pull himself forward.],
,SpongeBob:, Not so fast. ,[grabs the line and ties it to the table],
,[SpongeBob takes the line and tangles it up around every table. SpongeBob jumps through the window and pulls the fishing line forward. The Fisherman gets pulled into the kitchen and is dumped into the fryer.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, looks like the hook is on the other fin now, huh?
,[The Fisherman is deep fried into a fish stick. SpongeBob comes out with the Fisherman completely fried to a crisp.],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, my friends. I have captured the evil doer.
,Creepy sea creatures:, Hey, leave him alone! ,[yelling],
,Squidabeth:, Just what do you think you're doing?
,SpongeBob:, Uh, catching a criminal.
,Squidabeth:, He's no criminal. He works here.
,[The Fisherman grumbles at SpongeBob.],
,Creature #1:, He robs us every night.
,Creature #2:, ,[hatches from an egg], It's a night shift tradition.
,SpongeBob:, ,[nervously], Oh, a night shift tradition. ,[clears throat], Heh, heh, oops. Sorry about that, Mr. Fisherman, sir. ,[sets the Fisherman down and tears the fried coating off him],
,Fisherman:, No worries, little yellow thing. ,[winks], You got some mean fishing skills. Respect.
,SpongeBob:, Oh. ,[giggles], You're not so bad yourself. ,[fist bumps the Fisherman's hook],
,Fisherman:, ,[grabs SpongeBob and holds him up], Attention, let's welcome our newest member of the night shift. ,[whispers], What's your name again?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], SpongeBob SquarePants.
,Fisherman:, SquareBob SpongePants!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, close enough.
,Fisherman:, ,[holds up a pile of money], A round of Night Patties for everyone! I'm buying!
,[All of the creepy creatures cheer. The scene changes to the foghorn sounding off at dawn. The Krusty Krab night shift sign turns off.],
,Squidabeth:, Quittin' time!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, already? ,[takes off his hat and puts it on the coat rack],
,[Squidabeth and the Fisherman put their apron and fishing pole on the coat rack as well.],
,Barry Blobfish:, ,[comes back with a cast around his arm], I'm back!
,SpongeBob:, Barry!
,Barry Blobfish:, Thanks for helping out, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it was nothing. ,[he gets in a group hug with the Fisherman, Squidabeth, and Barry Blobfish], Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys.
,[Nosferatu joins in the group hug and everyone laughs.],
,Squidabeth:, Come and visit us again soon, honey.
,Fisherman:, We're here every night.
,[Squidabeth, Barry Blobfish, Nosferatu, and the Fisherman exit the restaurant and disappear in a misty fog. Moments later, Mr. Krabs appears.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[confused], Huh, huh, huh? ,[rubs his eyes],
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you doing here so early, boy-o?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I was helping out on the night shift.
,Mr. Krabs:, Night shift, hmm? We don't have a night shift. Hmm, ,[pats SpongeBob's head], must have been a bad dream, kiddo.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? Gee, guess I must have been sleep-working.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I ain't sleep-paying you. So, get to wakey-working! ,[goes into his office],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir. ,[sighs as he sits on a chair and gets poked by something], Yow! ,[sees a fish hook in his buttocks], A fish hook?
,[The entire scene changes into a spiraling hypnosis screen.],
,French Narrator:, Case history of a fry cook who wanted a late night snack but ended up in the fry vat of doubt. ,[Barry Blobfish, Squidabeth, and Nosferatu fly through the void], Mr. SquarePants will never know he has worked a shift in ""The Tidal Zone.""
,[The night train drives through ""The Tidal Zone"" and Patrick is riding in it. It turns out that all of the characters that SpongeBob met during the Krusty Krab's supposed night shift are just illusions created by ""The Tidal Zone."" Even Patrick, who supposedly likes the night shift, is an illusion too. So, it is unknown where the real Patrick is at the time.],
,Patrick:, I'd like five Night Patties to go, please.

"[Patrick is tip-toeing around and laughing. Falls off a barrel],
,Patrick:, Look, another rubber stopper for my rubber stopper collection. ,[pulls out the stopper. Toxic waste spills out. Cut to Patrick holding a snow globe], It's a little land that's all mine. ,[turns it upside-down and back up], Now it's snowing in my little land. ,[shakes it], It's snowing again. ,[puts the snow globe down and claps. The ground shakes. A monster drools on Patrick], Hey, my little land must be having an earthquake. ,[a purple monster is standing over Patrick. It growls], Must have been an aftershock. ,[monster grabs the snow globe and roars], Uh, hey, no wonder you're angry. You just gotta turn it upside down. See? ,[the monster turns it upside-down and back up. He laughs and so does Patrick],
,Narrator:, Much, much later... ,[Patrick and the monster are still laughing],
,Patrick:, Snow globes are always funny. ,[sniffs his armpit], Hey, you want to smell my armpit? There you go.
,[Monster sniffs Patrick's armpit. Patrick laughs. The monster pokes Patrick and has him smell his armpit],
,Patrick:, Thanks. Oh, hey, do you like to play tag? ,[monster growls], Never played it before, huh? Uh, yeah, it's kinda hard to explain. Oh, how about hide-and-seek? ,[monster growls], No, no, no, this one's easy. You just close your eyes while the other guy hides, and then you find him and you win. Okay? Ready, uh, now go hide. ,[covers eyes], 1, 2, 3. You can skip a few, 100. Okay, ready or not, here I come. ,[monster is not there], Hey, where'd you go? Why are you hiding from me? ,[sobs], This game's harder than I thought. ,[monster touches Patrick on the shoulder and growls], You want to smell my armpit again? ,[cut to them playing ringtoss], You win again. Hey, hey, you want to do meet my friend, SpongeBob? Uh, he's a little weird, but you guys will probably get along. ,[the monster grabs Patrick and puts him in his mouth], We can play more coral ring toss later.
,SpongeBob:, ,[putting food in Gary's bowl], Dinnertime, Gary. And it's your favorite flavor—crushed anemone byproducts and krill. ,[ground shakes], What is that horrific banging? ,[looks out the window and sees Patrick inside the monster's mouth], Patrick's being eaten by a giant sea monster!
,Patrick:, Hey, hey!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he's crying out for help.
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob! Hey, up here! Look, no hands! ,[chuckles],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, this is even worse than yesterday.
,Narrator:, Yesterday... ,[at Krusty Krab, a customer is trying to get some ice in his cup but there is no ice coming out],
,Nat:, Excuse me, I think your ice machine's broken.
,Squidward:, Keep looking. You'll find someone who cares.
,Nat:, Uh, you're the owner here, aren't you?
,Mr. Krabs:, That would be me. ,[chuckles],
,Nat:, Well, I think your ice machine might be broken.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, try telling that guy over there. ,[points to SpongeBob, who is cleaning tables],
,Nat:, Excuse me, the ice machine's broken.
,SpongeBob:, No! Why?! Why?! Why?! ,[sobbing], Why?! ,[flashback ends], It was horrible. ,[knock on door. SpongeBob opens it to see Patrick], Patrick! Patrick! ,[gives him a hug],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, I must've been daydreaming. I saw you in this big monster's dripping maw, and I thought you were being eaten.
,Patrick:, Uh, I wasn't being eaten. That monster is my friend. I thought you might like to meet him.
,SpongeBob:, I would be delighted to meet him.
,Patrick:, Well, in that case, SpongeBob, I would like to introduce you to... I would like to introduce you to... I forgot his name. What do I do? What do I do?
,SpongeBob:, Don't panic. Introduce me first. Then he'll say his name when he meets me.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[to monster], Uh, I'd like you to meet my friend, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, And you are? ,[monster growls and drools all over Patrick and SpongeBob], Nice to meet you, Mr. ,[growls. Cut to later], Well, Rrarrg, now that we're friends, I would like to show you my home.
,Patrick:, And this is ,my, home.
,SpongeBob:, Where is ,your, home? Oh, maybe he doesn't have a home.
,Patrick:, Doesn't have a home? ,[bell dings], Hey, wait a minute, you can live under my rock if you want, Rrarrg. ,[the monster puts Patrick's rock on top of his head and adjusts it. SpongeBob, Patrick, and the monster all laugh. The monster throws Patrick's rock and breaks it into pieces. Everyone laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he smashed your house.
,Patrick:, Yeah. ,[everyone still laughing], He's gonna smash your house now.
,SpongeBob:, ,[yelps], He's going to smash ,my, house! Gary! ,[monster throws the pineapple], Gary! Jump, Gary, jump! ,[Gary jumps out of the window], Parachute, Gary. Use your parachute. ,[Gary uses it],
,Patrick:, He's gonna smash Squidward's place now. ,[monster picks up the island head],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Patrick, I don't-- ,[Patrick laughs],
,Patrick:, Encore! ,[monster throws Squidward's house, destroying it. Patrick claps a few time as the police cars drive up and surround Rrarrg with barbed wire fencing], Wow, the police have arrived.
,SpongeBob:, And they built a cute, little fence around Rrarrg. ,[Squidward walks past], Hi, Squidward, you're home early. ,[Squidward walks up to the cops],
,Cop:, Hold it, buddy. Where are you going?
,Squidward:, I live here. ,[cops laugh], And what's so funny?
,Cop:, Oh, the thought of anyone living in a pile of gravel.
,Squidward:, I'll have you know, sir, that ,my home, is a-- pile of gravel?! ,[screams],
,Cop:, Sir, don't yell at me. We don't want to alert the--
,Squidward:, Alert the what?
,Cop:, That big, scary monster inside the fence over there. ,[points. The monster waves],
,SpongeBob:, He waved at you, Squidward. That means he likes you.
,Squidward:, He likes me. Officer, arrest me right now, because I am about to throw a horrible tantrum that no one around here wants to see. ,[cut to later],
,Cop #2:, What do you think he's doing up there?
,Cop #3:, Who?
,Cop #2:, The big guy.
,Cop #3:, I don't know.
,Cop #2:, What?
,Cop #3:, I said I don't know.
,Cop #2:, ,[sneezes in a megaphone, which upsets the monster and runs away],
,Cop #3:, He's escaped!
,Cop #2:, Quick, everybody into the... ,[grabs megaphone], Quick, everybody into the squad car. ,[the monster runs and squishes the cop cars], Oh, darn it.
,Cop #4:, Now what are we going to do?
,Cop #2:, We shall have to chase him on foot. ,[monster growls as he runs away], It's headed straight for town. ,[they chase him into town and then stop], There, by the magazine stand. Hold it right there, bub. ,[monster is reading a magazine], This is a newsstand, not a library. ,[over megaphone], Okay, one more step, and I'll sneeze. ,[monster groans],
,Patrick:, Wait just one minute. This is my friend. If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me.
,Cop #2:, We're prepared to do that.
,Patrick:, Actually... just let me to talk to him for a minute. Psst. ,[monster picks him up],
,Cop #2:, You mean, that thing can speak?
,Patrick:, ,[scoffs], Of course. He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak. ,[both whisper indistinctly], And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun.
,Cop #2:, That was... ,[sniffles], beautiful. We still gotta run him out of town. ,[cut to monster waving goodbye and walking off into the distance],
,Patrick:, It really crushes my heart to see him go.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, crushes. Patrick, ""crushes""—that gives me an idea. ,[cut to a snowy mountaintop where Patrick is standing by a phone. The phone rings],
,Patrick:, ,[picks up phone], Yeah? Okay. ,[hangs up], Two cubes, please. ,[the monster crushes a block of ice into cubes. He takes two and throws them],
,SpongeBob:, ,[at the Krusty Krab], Your ice cubes, sir.
,Nat:, What? Where? ,[the ice cubes that the monster threw land in his cup], Hey, thanks, buddy.
,SpongeBob:, Don't thank me. Thank Raarg.

,Patrick:, Now you. ,[gives SpongeBob the stick],
,[SpongeBob hits the cup with the stick.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[sighs], Yes, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Do you think it will make the game more exciting if we played it with... ,[holds out two sticks], two sticks?
,[Patrick's head buffs up and snatches the sticks from SpongeBob's hands.],
,Patrick:, Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Patrick. I'm just so bored playing ""Stick in a Cup.""
,Nathiel Waters:, ,[on television], Are you tired of playing with an old stick and a cup?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[turn their heads to the TV], Yeah.
,Nathiel Waters:, ,[on television], Well, say goodbye to boring and hello to whirly brains! The exciting new toy that puts you in the driver's seat of your own mind! It's so simple! Just flip your lid, attach the propeller, and watch your brain soar hundreds of feet into the air as you control the action!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick get very excited about the advertisement on TV and their eyes were put in a trance. Two fishing poles dragged them to the screen.],
,Nathiel Waters:, Get your whirly brain today and free your mind!
,SpongeBob:, Free my mind! Free my mind! Free my mind! ,[chews on a stick],
,[Patrick chews on a cup. Both SpongeBob and Patrick grab to television and started doing a tug-of-war with it.],
,SpongeBob:, I want it!
,Patrick:, No, I want it!
,SpongeBob:, No, I want it!
,Patrick:, No, I want it!
,SpongeBob:, No, it's mine!
,Patrick:, I want it! I want it!
,SpongeBob:, No, it's mine!
,[They pulled so hard that they accidentally break the television into pieces.],
,Patrick:, Sorry to hear about your TV, SpongeBob.
,[They put the television back together and it turns on.],
,Nathiel Waters:, ,[on television], Whirly brains available now at Bikini Bottom Toy Shop.
,[They put the television down and start dancing around.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains! Whirly brains!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob opening the Whirly Brainbox and taking out the propeller. SpongeBob climbs up on Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick. Just let me flip your lid so I can attach the propeller directly to your brain.
,[SpongeBob tries to open Patrick's head, but failed as it gets out of shape. SpongeBob slides down and Patrick straightens out his face. SpongeBob reads the instruction paper.],
,SpongeBob:, Step one... ,[reads], Oh, I see what to do.
,[SpongeBob pulls out a monster mask, puts it on and scares Patrick out of his wits. Patrick's head opens up.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes off mask], It's just me, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh! ,[sighs],
,[SpongeBob attaches the propeller on Patrick's brain and gives Patrick the mask.],
,SpongeBob:, Now, you do me!
,[Patrick puts on the mask.],
,Patrick:, Boo!
,[SpongeBob screams as his head opens up. Patrick attaches the propeller on SpongeBob's brain and takes off the mask. SpongeBob takes out the remote controls and gives one to Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, It's time to free our minds!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick activate the remotes and their brains slowly exit their heads with their eyeballs attached, leaving their bodies blind. Their whirly brains then fly around the air.],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Patrick! I've never seen the world from this angle before!
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], And the propeller tickles my think folds! ,[laughs], Hey, hey, hey, SpongeBob! Eye bump!
,SpongeBob:, Eye bump!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains crash into each other and injuries their eyes.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, no more eye bumps. Okay?
,Patrick:, ,[rubs his eye hole], I feel you.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly around SpongeBob's house. The whirly brains fly through the chimney and come out through the sink faucet. SpongeBob's whirly brain flies around the kitchen to look for Patrick's whirly brain. Patrick's whirly brain, who is in the freezer, sneaks up on SpongeBob's whirly brain and pulls it in. The two whirly brains fight each other inside, which makes the refrigerator bounce around the house and sends it crashing outside. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as their whirly brains feel dizzy.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whirly freeze!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly through a bush and makes a SpongeBob and Patrick-shaped topiary. Patrick's whirly brain slices the pineapple peel off of SpongeBob's house, revealing Gary doing his business in his litter box. Gary hides himself in the curtain. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick. I know who we can spy on. ,[laughs],

,Squidward:, Stop serenading me, you sap! It's my day off! Now, go away!
,[Squidward takes out a mirror and looks at his reflection. But to his horrifying surprise, he sees SpongeBob's whirly brain on his head and freaks out.],
,SpongeBob:, Found him!
,[Patrick's whirly brain flies out of Squidward's toilet.],
,Patrick:, Yep, that's him! Hi, Squidward!
,[Squidward is freaked out.],
,Squidward:, Aliens from Mars! It's an invasion!
,[Squidward jumps out the window and lands flat on his face in the ground. He gets up and frantically runs around, naked. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick flying their whirly brains around until they sliced their heads. The heads fall on the wrong bodies.],

,Mrs. Puff:, Yes, Eugene?
,Mr. Krabs:, Can I steal a little kiss?
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh! ,[laughs], Oh, Eugene! I thought you'd never ask.
,[SpongeBob turns the brain gas lever on the remote.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come here, you.

,Mr. Krabs:, What a woman!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[blushes], Oh, Eugene!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains flying around, creating a whirly brain-shaped cloud with the gas. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh until someone throws eggs in their faces.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, What was that?
,[Right in front of SpongeBob and Patrick was a kid who also has a whirly brain. But he is using it to bully people like throwing eggs.],
,Kid:, Oh, that smarts! ,[laughs], Bullseye!
,Patrick:, I thought we were the first kids on the block to get whirly brains!
,Kid:, What are you? Thick? Every kid in town's got a whirly brain! ,[spits],
,[Numerous whirly brains fly around SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains.],
,Buddy:, Daddy, daddy! Can I have a whirly brain too?
,Fred:, Absolutely not, son. Your brain is your body's most important organ, not a toy.
,[Buddy cries while a whirly brain flies towards Fred and hits him. Buddy laughs.],
,SpongeBob:, Hooray! Now, we can play whirly brains with the whole neighborhood! Hey, kid! Race ya to the end of the street!
,Kid:, Eat my brainstem slowpoke!
,[The three whirly brains take their positions for their race.],
,Patrick:, Get ready, get set, punch it!
,[The three whirly brains fly through the air at fast speed. The kid's whirly brain spit out gas to blind SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains. SpongeBob and Patrick cough and continue to fly. The kid's whirly brain laughs as he is beating them. But unfortunately, the kid's whirly brain ended up flying into Bubble Bass's butt. SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly past Bubble Bass.],
,SpongeBob:, Yes! We're gonna beat him, Patrick! We're gonna win!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains continue flying until suddenly, they get hit by someone's can and fell on the ground. The cane belonged to a grouchy old man who thought kids were invading his property with toys.],
,Angry Old Timer:, Play your toys into my yard, will ya? Well, they're mine now!
,[The old man takes SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains inside his house and stores them into a barrel where he keeps the other whirly brains in. He wraps a sheet over the barrel so they won't fly out.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, what's going on? Everything went dark! Uh, Patrick, can you see anything?
,Patrick:, Only the dismal abyss of black nothingness. ,[his eyeholes widen],
,SpongeBob:, Aw, our remote controls are dead too! Oh, Patrick, I don't want to jump to any conclusions here, but I think that we have lost our minds!
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], M-O-O-N. ,[laughs], That spells moon! ,[laughs hysterically],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, don't panic, Patrick. We'll find them. Just take it easy. Take it easy! PATRICK, TAKE IT EASY!
,Patrick:, I'm taking it easy, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Our brains are probably right around here somewhere. Uh, here brains! Brains! Here, boy! ,[stutters],
,Patrick:, Here, brains!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick look for their whirly brains. SpongeBob touches Nazz who is holding her baby.],
,SpongeBob:, Brainy, where are you?
,[Patrick touches Officer John.],
,Patrick:, Brain, brain, brain! I think I found it, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, I've found mine too!
,[SpongeBob has the baby on his head with it's feet sticking out of his eye holes while Patrick has a fire hydrant on his head.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, darn it. I still can't see.
,Patrick:, Yeah, my brain won't fit back in.
,[Patrick hits the fire hydrant with a hammer. Nazz takes her baby out of SpongeBob's head, leaving it's stinky diaper behind.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, ma'am, you forgot something.
,Nazz:, That's okay. You can keep it. ,[she leaves],
,Patrick:, I'll take it!
,[Patrick takes the smelly diaper and puts it in his head. He closes his head and marks dots on it to make it look like eyes.],
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah! Lookin' good!
,SpongeBob:, Ew! Give me that!
,[SpongeBob kicks open Patrick's head and throws away the smelly diaper.],
,Patrick:, Aww, man! That felt all squishy! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, we need help. Let's call Sandy.
,Patrick:, Okay. Sandy!
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out phone], Patrick, I meant on the phone.
,[SpongeBob dials the number and calls Sandy.],
,Sandy:, ,[on phone], Hello?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Sandy!
,[The scene changes to Sandy using her brain detector while SpongeBob and Patrick are tied to a rope so they won't get lost.],
,Sandy:, Dang. You two sure are lucky that I created this brain detector last summer. I was beginning to think I'd never use this thing.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I hope we find our brains soon. They're probably cold and hungry by now. Poor things.
,[Soon, everyone in town is looking for their missing whirly brains and as they look, they end up crashing into each other.],
,Sandy:, And it looks like you're not the only critters around these parks to lose your minds. ,[looks at her detector], Hmm... And my detector is leading us directly to that house.
,[The old man who stole SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains is sleeping on his rocking chair on the porch.],
,Sandy:, Excuse me, kind sir. Would you mind too terribly if we just came in your house for a minute and looked around for my friend's missin' brains?
,[The old man is still sleeping.],
,Sandy:, We're gonna take that as a yes. Step lively, fellas!
,[Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the old man's house.],
,Sandy:, This place has a ten-gallon case of the creepies. I wonder what's in...
,[Sandy takes a peek inside the barrel.],
,Sandy:, ,[gasps], Hey, fellas! I think I've found your brains!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hooray!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick jump in excitement but accidentally creaks the floor.],
,Angry Old Timer:, ,[offscreen], Hey!
,SpongeBob, Sandy and Patrick:, Huh?
,Angry Old Timer:, What are you sneak thieves doing into my house? Them brains violated my air space and I'm keepin' them! I'm callin' the cops!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick pleads the old man not to call the police, crying.],
,Sandy:, Sorry nothin'! Look, Old Timer, one false move and I'll be on you like a horsefly on a cracker barrel!
,Angry Old Timer:, Bring it on, Slimmy Whiskers! All twenty-threes can do your bees knees with one nickel, sister!
,Sandy:, Alright! Now you listen to me, you twisted coot! You can't steal somebody's brain just because it flies into your yard! That's brain-napping! And it looks like I'll be the one callin' the police!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I love it when Sandy gets aggressive. Let's give her some room.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick back up but they both trip over the barrel and frees the whirly brains the old man stole. The whirly brains fly out of the old man's house and heads back to town to find their owners. Some of the whirly brains ring the doorbells.],
,Fred:, Oh, Brainy, you're back!
,[Everyone cheers as their whirly brains have been returned. SpongeBob and Patrick's whirly brains fly back into their heads. SpongeBob and Patrick remove the propellers from their brains and close their heads, returning to normal.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew! I'll never be a no-brainer again! ,[laughs],
,Sandy:, Everyone has their brains back, so I'm a let it go this time. But if you steal as much as a beach ball, so help me I'll...
,Angry Old Timer:, ,[cries], I'm sorry, Squirrel Lady! I just couldn't take watching all the kids have fun in the air while I'm stuck here with this crotchety cane on the ground!
,SpongeBob and Sandy:, Aww!
,Sandy:, Well, I think we've got a cure for what ails you. Right, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
,Sandy:, I think I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick?
,[Patrick is pulling his head with a plunger.],
,Patrick:, My think is clogged.
,[The scene changes to the old man flying through the air with the whirly brain propellers and is having a lot of fun.],
,Sandy:, Sure was nice of you two to donate your whirly brains to the old timer. You fellas did a good deed today.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no need to thank us, Sandy. If we can just make one angry old man happy, that and itself is thanks enough. The dignity of the elderly was the victor here today.
,[The old man flies above several old people at Shady Shoals Resting Home.],
,Angry Old Timer:, ,[laughs], Look out my dears below! Take a ride on the love copter!
,[Squidward, who is still naked, runs past Shady Shoals Resting Home.],
,Squidward:, The Martians are coming! Run for your lives! You're next! You're next!

,Martha Smith:, Hold it right there, buddy! My son just dropped that quarter.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it? ,[Martha hits Mr. Krabs in the face with her purse], Hey!

,Mr. Krabs:, You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever.
,Harold:, Can we have our quarter back now? ,[scene cuts to Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready?
,SpongeBob:, You can't rush perfection.
,Squidward:, I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Always the kidder, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[enters the Krusty Krab], Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya. ,[scene cuts to outside Krusty Krab where there is a red X on the ground], X marks the spot of the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well.
,SpongeBob:, A wishing well, here? Wow!
,Squidward:, Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Squidward, don't you believe in magic? ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?
,Squidward:, No, I don't, and neither does Mr. Krabs.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true. ,[starts digging], What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?
,Squidward:, To be far away from you as possible. C'mon, SpongeBob, this hole's not gonna dig itself. And I'm certainly not gonna do it.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. ♪Take a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...♪
,Squidward:, Hey!
,SpongeBob:, ♪...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams and you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.♪
,Squidward:, I'm not cryin'! ,[SpongeBob hits him with the wand], Ow. Ow.
,SpongeBob:, ♪When you throw all your dreams down the well.♪ ,[puts an ""open"" sign in front of the well], Well, Squidward, what do you think?
,Squidward:, That was the worst song I ever heard. But at least this stupid well's finished.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's beautiful. ,[takes a whiff of the air], You smell that, boys? That's the smell of money.
,SpongeBob:, You mean magic, don't ya?
,Squidward:, All I can smell is that dumpster. ,[scene pans over to a dumpster behind Squidward],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, Squidward, you can go back to the register.
,Squidward:, As long as there's no singing.
,SpongeBob:, And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta.
,SpongeBob:, A promotion? ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob being lowered in the well by a bucket], Why do I have to go down in the well?
,Mr. Krabs:, To collect the money!
,SpongeBob:, How long do I have to stay down here?
,Mr. Krabs:, See ya in 8 hours.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here. ,[a coin hits SpongeBob in the head],
,Sandy:, I sure wish I had a fancy telescope. One that works underwater. That'd make me happier than a junebug at a porch light sale.
,SpongeBob:, Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes... ,[another coin hits SpongeBob in the head],
,Plankton:, I have presented you with a monetary offering as custom dictates. My wish, née my command, is to be taller. Just a little? Just big enough to crush my enemies, like the vermin they are!
,SpongeBob:, Gosh... ,[another coin hits SpongeBob in the head], Ow!
,Mrs. Puff:, I wish I had a snazzy new boat. I wanna be a hot rod momma. ,[SpongeBob gasps. Patrick walks up to the well drinking a soda and throws it down the well when he is finished],
,SpongeBob:, Hey!
,Patrick:, Oh my gosh. Who said that?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, How do you know my name?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish.
,Patrick:, Okay, magical talking trashcan. ,[takes out a coin from his pocket], I wish SpongeBob were here to see this. ,[throws himself and the coin down the well],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[lands on top of SpongeBob], Hi, SpongeBob! I got my wish.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it.
,Patrick:, But I got my wish.
,SpongeBob:, Well, we've got 6½ hours ‘til the end of my shift. What do you want to do now?
,Patrick:, ,[pokes SpongeBob], Tag, you're it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pokes Patrick], Tag, you're it.
,Patrick:, ,[pokes SpongeBob], Tag, you're it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pokes Patrick], Tag, you're it. ,[day turns into night],

,Patrick:, ,[pokes SpongeBob], Tag, you're it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pokes Patrick], Tag, you're it.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get?
,SpongeBob:, I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton... ,[Patrick smiles big], ...and this slightly used pair of dentures.
,Patrick:, And I fell on my head.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money. ,[sends the bucket down],
,SpongeBob:, This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, sure, whatever.
,SpongeBob:, Can we come out now?
,Mr. Krabs:, Goodness, no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, ♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.♪ ,[digs a hole and something yellow glows from the hole], Holy mackerel, look, Patrick! We've struck magic.
,Patrick:, Is that good?
,SpongeBob:, Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done.
,Patrick:, It's the only thing I've ever done.
,Squidward:, Having fun down there, SpongeBob? ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, Hi, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better.
,SpongeBob:, Do you wanna make a wish?
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me.
,SpongeBob:, Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic.
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing wells are just a scam to fool saps like you. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it. ,[Squidward falls down the well landing on SpongeBob and Patrick], Squidward! You decided to join the party.
,Patrick:, Party!
,Squidward:, Let me out of here.
,SpongeBob:, We were just gonna play some party games.
,Patrick:, ,[pokes Squidward], Tag, you're it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pokes Squidward], Tag, you're it.
,Patrick:, ,[pokes Squidward], Tag, you're it.
,Squidward:, I gotta get out of here. ,[tries to climb out of the well],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Go Squidward! Go Squidward! ,[he falls],
,Squidward:, There's no way to climb out of here.
,SpongeBob:, Maybe if you had more upper arm strength.
,Patrick:, Yeah, you should work out more.
,Squidward:, Well, why don't I just start right now? After all, I got a couple of dumbbells right here. ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, I don't get it.
,Squidward:, Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic.
,Patrick:, What does claustrophobic mean?
,SpongeBob:, It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.
,Squidward:, No, it doesn't.
,Patrick:, Ho, ho, ho! ,[giggles],
,SpongeBob:, Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!
,Patrick:, Ho, ho, ho!
,Squidward:, It's not working, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Darn.
,SpongeBob:, Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot.
,Squidward:, Oh, sorry, SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, ,[holding a plate of ribs], And you got your elbow in my ribs.
,Squidward:, Eww. Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[shoves Squidward], And stop stepping in my potato salad.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, hey, hey, guys.
,Squidward:, ,[shoves Patrick], Stop pushing me, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh, you mean like this? ,[shoves Squidward],
,Squidward:, No, like this! ,[shoves Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, ,[both Patrick and Squidward are fighting], You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place. ,[scene zooms to outside the well],
,Squidward:, Patrick, get off of me! ,[scene zooms back into the well where Patrick is sitting on Squidward], I told you I am claustrophobic!
,Patrick:, Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here.
,Squidward:, Patrick! ,[scene cuts to daytime where Mr. Krabs returns to the well],
,Mr. Krabs:, Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got. ,[raises the bucket], Boy, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money. ,[Squidward comes out of the well],
,Squidward:, Free. I'm free!
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve of the overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes?
,Squidward:, The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here. ,[gets hit by a bus that is traveling to 'very very far away'], Ow.
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip!
,Patrick:, ,[pulls a long face], Lucky. ,[walks off],
,Mr. Krabs:, So how much money did you make last night?
,SpongeBob:, We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic.
,Mr. Krabs:, The what?
,SpongeBob:, We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it. ,[a big telescope with an eye looking out of it appears. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob scream], What in the deep blue is that?
,Sandy:, There's a full moon out tonight. Do you like my new telescope I wished for?
,SpongeBob:, That's great, Sandy!
,Sandy:, That wishing well sure does work.
,Mr. Krabs:, Just a coincidence. ,[Mrs. Puff drives up in a new boat],
,Mrs. Puff:, What do you think of my new hot rod?
,SpongeBob:, It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin? ,[both laugh],
,Mrs. Puff:, No. ,[drives off],
,SpongeBob:, See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat.
,Mr. Krabs:, You mean she stole that boat.
,Plankton:, ,[walks up gigantically tall], Morning, SpongeBob. Krabs. Beautiful day. ,[laughs evilly and runs over to the buildings and knocks them over],
,SpongeBob:, Is that proof enough for ya?
,Mr. Krabs:, You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya. ,[walks over to the well], I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter. ,[lets go of the penny and laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[frantic],Mr. Krabs! No!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, where's your magic now? ,[vanishes in thin air and appears as a real crab on a plate], Oh, where am I? What's going on here? ,[person sits down and puts on an eating bib that says ""THE END"" on it], Uh-oh. I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! Oh no! ,[iris out],

"[episode starts off with a close up of the Krusty Krab],

,[There is a pause],.
,Squidward:, Adorable.
,Patrick:, Cuter than a regular Krabby Patty?
,Squidward :, Yes.

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[wakes up], Money back?!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks out of office with towel wrapped around him], What's the problem here?
,Patrick:, My Kiddy meal didn't come with a toy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. And you'd like to upgrade to the toy package is that right?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't have any toys.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, really? ,[takes Krabby Patty away from customer], Then what do you call?...,[fixes Krabby Patty], this?
,[The Krabby Patty now has eyes, legs, a mouth, and arms made from kitchen ingredients],.

,Patrick:, Don't you mean ""our"" new toy?
,SpongeBob:, Our new toy?
,Patrick:, It came from the meal that we're ""sharing.""

,Patrick:, Remember? ,[imitates SpongeBob], Sharing is the most wonderful feeling in the world, like dancing with a magical seahorse through an enchanted kelp garden ,[stops imitating SpongeBob], Remember those words, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I didn't say that. But I guess we can share Patty Pal. ,[Patrick takes Patty Pal and laughs], Now can I see it again, Patrick? ,[Patrick takes Patty Pal away],

,Both:, Hi, Sandy.
,Sandy:, What in tarnation's going on with you two?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob won't let me play with my toy.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick won't share OUR toy.
,Sandy:, What you need is a mediator. Y'all best sit down and work this out. Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication. You can only resolve conflict when you understand each other. ,[Patrick and SpongeBob start drying up], So I want each of you to state what is most important to the each of you right now.

,SpongeBob:, Only because you hogged it all night.
,Patrick:, I did not!
,SpongeBob:, Did too!
,Patrick:, Nuh-uh!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you toy eater!
,Patrick:, Tattletale!
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa, whoa, whoa there, now, settle down. All this brawling is over a toy? You two shouldn't let a little trinket get between youse. You should be ashamed of yourselves. If I gave each of ya another toy, would that make you happy?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Yes.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you're in luck! You two seem so thrilled with the toy. I had an entire case of 'em made. They've been selling my hotcakes. That'll be $13.50 each.

,SpongeBob:, Okay! First question: What is your best friend's favorite color?
,Patrick:, Aw, man! Pulling out the big guns. Color. Color.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps to give Patrick a hint],
,Patrick:, No, no! No hints! ,[Struggles], Blue! No, clear! No! ,[slaps himself in the face], That's not it. Hold on, hold on. 14.
,SpongeBob:, The answer is...beige.
,Patrick:, Oh, barnacles! Oh, I was so close.
,SpongeBob:, Question 2: Is your best friend left-handed or right-handed?
,Patrick:, ,[paces back and forth], Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous! ,[grows another pair of arms],
,Patrick:, Oh, fish paste!
,SpongeBob:, Next question: Does your best friend have an innie, or an outie belly button?
,Patrick:, Belly button, huh? Hmm. An innie!
,[there is a loud buzzer that comes when there is a wrong answer to a question],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Patrick. I have an outie. ,[Shows SpongeBob's outie belly button],
,Patrick:, Tartar sauce!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?

,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up a sign that says ""Krabby Patty"" in one hand, and an actual Krabby Patty in the other],
,Patrick:, Oh! Oh! I remember! Your favorite food is a chum burger!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Frowns and puts down sign and Krabby Patty], No.
,Patrick:, I thought for sure I had that one.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?
,Patrick:, Ooh. That's a toughie. ,[Eyes SpongeBob's muscles], Hmm. Rugged biceps. ,[inspects SpongeBob's eyes], Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!
,SpongeBob:, ,[his work hat deflates. He clears his throat], Uh, last question!
,Patrick:, ,[claps hands], Ooh! This is for the win!
,SpongeBob:, What shape is your best friend?
,Patrick:, Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?

,[Cuts to Squidward adjusting his boat outside the kitchen, in the dining area],
,Squidward:, Idiots, wrecking my boat.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the dining area],
,Squidward:, So, who won your stupid quiz?
,Patrick:, It was a tie.
,Spongebob:,  Well it wasn’t a tie, but we had lots of fun.
,Squidward:, ,[takes the Simple-Ton magazine], Let me see that. ,[Starts laughing], a triangle?! Patrick didn't know anything about you! ,[continues laughing], And he's supposed to be your best friend?
,Patrick:, I know, it's like we're not friends at all!
,SpongeBob:, Now, now. Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me. Right, Patrick? ,[turns to Patrick, but he's nowhere in sight], Patrick?
,[Scene shows Patrick outside, buying ice cream from the ice cream truck],
,Patrick:, Ice cream!
,Squidward:, Looks like your best friend isn't a friend at all! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks outside to Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob! I got you an ice cream. ,[holds out an ice cream cone to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes the cone], Thank you, best friend, Patrick.
,Patrick:, It's your favorite! Dill Pickle Swirl with mustard and extra bacon bits!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this is your favorite ice cream. My favorite is, plain vanilla.
,Patrick:, Oh, oh right. ,[takes the ice cream out of SpongeBob's hand], Well, more ice cream for me!
,[SpongeBob's eyes start watering],
,Patrick:, Oh, can I borrow five bucks?
,[SpongeBob miserably takes the money out of his pocket],
,SpongeBob:, Here! Take your dirty, rotten money! ,[throws the money onto the ground], Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE! ,[runs off, crying],
,Ice Cream Man:, Hey, what's with him?
,Patrick:, I guess he didn't want any ice cream.
,[Cut to SpongeBob in his room, on his bed, sobbing. Gary comes by toward his food bowl, but he sees it's holding SpongeBob's tears as they land right in the bowl],
,Gary:, Meow-row. ,[gets splashed by SpongeBob's tears as he sobs even harder. Gary slithers away crossly], Meow-row-row...
,SpongeBob:, It just isn't fair! ,[tries to calm himself down], Oh, who needs Patrick anyway? ,[leaves his house], Rest of my life, here I come! ,[walks by Patrick, who's sunning himself on his rock],
,Patrick:, Oh, hey there, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[to himself], Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star. ,[Walks off],
,Patrick:, See you later!
,[Cuts to Sandy's Treedome, where Sandy is trying to comfort a sobbing SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Sandy! It was awful! Truly awful! We were like complete strangers!
,Sandy:, You don't need to know everything about your best friend. That's what keeps the friendship interesting!
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Sandy:, Maybe you and Patrick just need some time apart.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles], Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick! ,[walks off to Sandy's door, and on his way out, he breaks down in tears again],
,Sandy:, ,[To herself], What a crybaby.

I can have a good time all by myself! ,[takes out jellyfishing net], I can go jellyfishing! ,[sobers up], Patrick and I used to go jellyfishing...I can play leapfrog! ,[jumps over a rock, then pulls it up on him and tries to toss it over his head, but winds up under it and tries to slide out from under it], I can blow bubbles! ,[blows a bubble, but it looks just like Patrick,], Uh, maybe not. ,[bubble pops, SpongeBob sighs],
,Patrick:, ,[walking by], Leedle leedle leedle lee!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it's Patrick! I can't let him see me! ,[Drills a hole in the sand and hides in it. Patrick skips over the hole. SpongeBob checks to make sure he's gone, then exits the hole],
,Patrick:, Leedle leedle lee!
,SpongeBob:, Well, he doesn't seem to be missing me at all. ,[Patrick walks off, still singing],
,Patrick:, Leedle leedle lee!
,SpongeBob:, Nice that he's gotten over our friendship so quickly! ,[SpongeBob then returns to the whole, and digs a tunnel that's following Patrick.. Patrick is seen entering the Gym while SpongeBob watches him from afar],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick works out at the gym? ,[Takes out binocular and watches Patrick exiting the Gym the Larry the Lobster], And he's hanging out with Larry the Lobster? Maybe I don't know much about Patrick, either.
,[cuts to Larry and Patrick entering a cooking supply shop while SpongeBob spies on them],
,SpongeBob:, ,[watches Patrick from the inside of a blender], Patrick's shopping for cookery? Very suspicious. Oh! He's coming back! ,[Hides back in the blender. Patrick comes to the blender and presses a button, activating the blender. Patrick then leaves. SpongeBob hand comes out of the blender and turns it off. And SpongeBob, now liquefied, exits the blender.. Cuts to Larry and Patrick purchasing something from the magic shop. As the exit, one of the top hats from the top hat display follows them],
,SpongeBob:, ,[From inside the hat], Hold it right there, Patrick! ,[jumps out of the hat],
,Larry the Lobster:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, We were just coming to see you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[angrily], Oh, I'll bet you were... to tell me about your new best friend, Larry, I suppose?!
,Larry:, Whoa, settle down, little dude. I don't want to get in the middle of, whatever this is. ,[Walks off],
,Patrick:, Well Larry is a great guy, loads of talent, and good looks.
,SpongeBob:, I know, he is pretty amazing...
,Patrick:, He's not my best friend. He was just helping me buy a present.
,SpongeBob:, ,[angrily], Who for? Sandy?
,Patrick:, No. For my REAL best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants. ,[holds out the bag he's holding],
,SpongeBob:, Really? ,[Takes the bag and opens it up], For me? What is it? ,[Takes out a rubber nose, mustache, and glasses disguise], Oh! I love it! You DO know me, best friend!
,Patrick:, ,[wearing the same disguise], I got a pair for me too! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick! ,[puts on his disguise], How do I look?
,Patrick:, ,[Screams], How should I know, mysterious stranger?! ,[runs away, screaming. SpongeBob sighs. And the episode comes to a close],

,Mr. Krabs:, Ravenous? ,[holds up a plate of Krabby Patties], That means hungry! ,[the whelks are starting towards The Krusty Krab], Krabby Patties! Get your Krabby Patties! Only 3.99 each! ,[the whelks swallow the Krabby Patties], That'll be 54.95. ,[the whelks spit out the Krabby Patties], Don't care for Krabby Patties, huh? Well, maybe there's something else on the menu you'd like!
,[a siren sounds and a platform comes out of the Krusty Krab, with SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward on it],

,Squidward:, And this affects me, how? ,[the whelk swallows Squidward and he screams],

,SpongeBob:, Uh, action packed, please?
,Sandy:, Yes! ,[jumps in the air], I need a sample of their slime! If I can analyze it, I might be deduce the cause of their behavior! And maybe we can stop them!

,Patrick:, He left his ""Best Friend"" ribbon behind! ,[the butterfly flies onto SpongeBob's helmet. Cut to a real life close-up on a horsefly as buzzing sounds play in the background. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run behind Sandy's table],
,Patrick:, What is that thing? [the butterfly is on the tree]
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Patrick. But whatever it is...it must've eaten Wormy!

,SpongeBob:, Quick, Patrick! We've gotta make a run for the door! ,[They start to run to the exit but the butterfly flies on the door], No! Patrick, it’s blocking our only exit! ,[They begin to run backwards to the back of Sandy's tree],
,Patrick:, Now what? We're trapped in here with that...that--""Best Friend Eater!""

,SpongeBob:, We did it, Patrick! We saved the city! ,[In the background, a meteor flies down and destroys a building], Just think what might of happened if we didn't tell everyone about the monster.
,Patrick:, About the what? ,[just then, Wormy flies by. SpongeBob, Patrick, and everyone else runs away from Wormy but they still being chased all over town by the butterfly no matter where they go.

"SpongeBob:, Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?
,Squidward:, ,[SpongeBob is trying to put up a banner], A little higher. A little to the left. A little more to the left.,[SpongeBob falls over], Ha- Perfect! ,[A barrel rolls along the floor, hits a ladder which hits a table into Squidward's head], Oww.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Mr. Krabs emerges from his office very happy, playing a concertina], Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!
,Squidward:, ,[crossly],No, he doesn't!
,SpongeBob:, But just look at him go!
,Squidward:, This is the day he gets the patty orders for the big Founder's Day eating contest, it's the most money Krabs makes all year.
,SpongeBob:, Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[slides down the rail], Nope, Squidward's right. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators! I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it. ,[Cuts to flashback],
,Commissioner:, Thanks Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure thing, Mr. Commissioner! See you at Founders' Day! ,[Mr. Krabs coughs after the commissioner drives off and smokes hits his mouth. Cuts out of flashback],
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪Oh, I wonder how many Krabby Patties I can sell!♪
,Squidward:, Wonder no longer, you only need one.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasps], ♪!lles nac I seittaP ybbarK ynam woh rednow I ,ho♪ ,[Grabs Squidward], What do you mean one?!
,Squidward:, Didn't you see today's newspaper?,[Shows Mr. Krabs the paper],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Reads paper], ""No takers for ""McNulty Challenge"". Ha! What's that suppose to mean?
,Squidward:, He's the current champion. He only needs to eat one patty to win.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasps], I'm ruined! No-one wants to see a one Krabby Patty Eating Contest, least of all me wallet. ,[Starts crying],
,SpongeBob:, Hey at least we have Founders Day!
,Mr. Krabs:, I couldn't give a seafit for Founders Day. I need sales boy, sales is what I need. Oh if only there was someone dumb and hungry enough to take on Ol' Oswald McNulty.
,Patrick:, ,[Walks by humming],
,Patrick:, ,[Stupidly talking to a broom  ], I'll just have 47 Krabby Patties, please. I had a big breakfast so I'm not that hungry. ,[Patrick grabs the broom.], Squidward did you get a new haircut?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah! Dumb and hungry. Well, if it isn't Patrick!
,Patrick:, I isn't Patrick?
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no of course you are! How would you like to eat as many Krabby Patties as you can handle and restore the honor of your home town.
,Patrick:, I like the first part but I don't understand the second part.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm talking about Oswald McNulty! He comes here every year with his big city ways and his extremely relaxed throat muscles and he shows us up a bunch of rubes. Rubes! And on Founders Day no less! We need a home-town hero to make me lots of mone- I mean return the belt to Bikini Bottom! He-he, He-he.,[Cuts to next scene.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!
,Patrick:, ,[Panicking and stupidly], Ah! Oh no, that's gonna hurt!
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen up, Mister. No more fooling around, you're here to eat and eat and then eat some more.
,Patrick:, ,[Enthusiastically], I like to eat!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well let's see how your tummy handles these patties Mr. likes-to-eat.
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick starts laughing], Ha-ha-ha, you said tummy.
,SpongeBob:, Tummies! Ha-ha-ha ,[Mr. Krabs blows whistle],
,Patrick:, ,[Enthusiastically], I like whistles!
,Mr. Krabs:, Eat!
,[Mr. Krabs starts the timer and Patrick takes a Krabby Patty and starts sniffing it and then eats it slowly.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you doin'? Your wastin' time!
,Patrick:, Gotta warm up my taste buds first. ,[shows Patrick's mouth then shows his taste buds cheering and they take the bits of Krabby Patty he eats.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Son, can you eat faster?
,Patrick:, Oh, faster? ,[Mr. Krabs starts the timer again and Patrick starts eating faster],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs stops timer.], Four and a half patties in one minute! Well McNulty can eat a hundred in a minute! But you know I think your teeth might be getting in the way a little bit-
,Patrick:, Oh, why didn't you say so. ,[Patrick takes out his teeth.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, I didn't know you had false teeth.
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], I don't
,Mr. Krabs:, Nah, that can't be it, McNulty has teeth. SpongeBob! Let's go to the film. ,[SpongeBob turns on film projector and shows McNulty eating Krabby Patties.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!
,Patrick:, His homework?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Or maybe we should be asking what Oswald McNulty is not doing.
,SpongeBob:, His taxes?
,Mr. Krabs:, Your both wrong! Or possibly right, I mean I don't know much about his personal life, the point is, he's not tasting boys, ,[shows McNulty's taste buds which aren't in use.], That's where Oswald McNulty has  the edge! Those extra seconds you take to taste a patty Patrick, are slowing you down! From now on ,[grabs Patrick's head and puts a patty in his mouth and puts his head down to swallow it.], You must put them in yer mouth, then swallow!
,Patrick:, ,[sadly], I don't get to taste?
,SpongeBob:, ,[worriedly], This feels wrong Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Sternly],Don't act bad bucket boy, we're gonna need a hundred more patties.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, i'll get right on it. ,[walks away.],
,Mr. Krabs:, We're gonna teach this sea star, a new way to eat! Without tasting. ,[Mr. Krabs pulls out Patrick's tongue then it shows his taste buds crying, then the scene cuts to Patrick starting training and eating patties.],
,Fred:, There he goes!
,Thaddeus:, Our champion!
,Sadie:, He's so dreamy!,[one of them fall over],
,[everybody is cheering for him.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[while throwing Krabby Patties to Patrick], Come one, come all! This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! It's a Founders Day extravaganza! Watch our home town hero, Patrick Star, take on the down the beloved champion from three towns over, Oswald McNulty! And see who takes, The Patty Belt!
,Diner Fish:, Say, can my little boy ask you something?
,Boy with a Broken Foot:, Are you the brave man that's gonna bring the belt back to Bikini Bottom?
,Patrick:, ,[Tries to say something but can't cause he's eating a Krabby Patty and then he gets some of the patty he was chewing on the two fish.],
,Diner Fish:, Inspiring words!
,Boy with a Broken Foot:, I hurted my foot on the playground.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, yeah, that's wonderful, move back. Be sure to bring your friends!,[they drive away and it bubble transitions to The Krusty Krab with a big crowd cheering and the contest is about to happen, then two guards bring Oswald McNulty and every one starts booing.],
,Boy with a Broken Foot:, Dad, is that the bad man who took the belt away from Bikini Bottom?
,Diner Fish:, Yes it is son. ,[both start booing.],
,Perch Perkins:, Looks like this crowd is hungry! For excitement that is, and also possibly food, any moment now these doors will open on what promises to be the most dynamic patty eating contest, in Founders Day history.
,Mr. Krabs:, Krabby Patties, T-shirts, conical hats, and, Patrick's chompers!
,Perch Perkins:, Today, our local hero, Patrick Star, the courageous underdog, is going against five time belt winner, Oswald McNulty from three towns over, one can only imagine the seeding tension pulling over right now, between these two titans of the sport, as they prepare for ultimate battle.
,Patrick:, ,[Scene cuts inside Krusty Krab where Patrick and Oswald are sitting casually from each other],Hey.
,Oswald McNulty:, How's it going.
,[SpongeBob and Squidward bring out the Krabby Patties.],
,Perch Perkins:, ,[holds a plate of Krabby Patties.], Five short minutes to consume as many patties as they can.
,SpongeBob:, Who's ready!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I don't wanna do this.
,SpongeBob:, Well then don't do it, i'm sure Mr. Krabs will understand.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffing.], I smell mutiny, what's going on here?
,Patrick:, I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings. ,[points to his tongue and his taste buds are crying.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no problem, ,[pulls out a paper],
,Patrick:, What's that?
,Mr. Krabs:, That, is a bill, for all those Krabby Patties you ate during training. ,[drops bill on the table for it to roll out very long, and the crowd is cheering.],
,Patrick:, But I didn't know I had to pay!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well I didn't know either until you decided you weren't doing the contest, and that means all your training patties, just became plain, eating patties. Now if you was to do the contest, I might be inclined to tear up this here little bill, and of course, there are all the people counting on you son. ,[Mr. Krabs points to the crowd and the Boy with a Broken Foot.],
,Boy with a Broken Foot:, Ow, my foot. ,[Patrick looks at him and feels sad.],
,Patrick:, Okay, i'll do it for the little boy with the hurt foot.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[tearing the bill.], You made the right choice kid! ,[laughs and then Squidward rings the bell.],
,Perch Perkins:, There's the bell! And we're off and eating. ,[McNulty starts eating], McNulty taking an early lead and really going to work with those patties, what a dynamo! A little skull from three towns over eating at a terrific pace! But what's this? ,[shows Patrick struggling to eat a single Krabby Patty.], Patrick Star isn't moving, he seems stuck in the gate!
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!
,Perch Perkins:, McNulty is pressing forward, looks like this is gonna be a blowout!
,Boy with a Broken Foot:, Patrick, ,[wearing Patrick merchandise], I believe in you Patrick. ,[Patrick is about to cry but he then starts eating.],
,Perch Perkins:, But wait! Patrick Star is on the move, patties are starting to disappear, look at that little sea star eat! He's inching closer to McNulty, and it look like McNulty can feel the heat, never have there been a more pretentious display of competitive eating! The amount of patties being consumed is astounding. ,[Patrick finishes a whole plate of patties and is starting to suck everything in.], And now, yes, yes! Patrick Star has matched Oswald McNulty! And they are tied as they come into the home stretch! Both eaters are so full they could barely eat but eat they do, moving so slowly now. One can't help but wonder if they are going to hit the patty wall at some point. And, and, ,[both McNulty and Patrick stop eating and fall on the table.], Both eaters have stopped! With only seconds left, we are tied in patties eaten, and neither one seems to have the room to go on! Oh! What is this? ,[McNulty falls down.], And down goes McNulty, down goes McNulty! ,[the crowd is cheering], It looks like we do have a tie!
,Patrick:, It's over SpongeBob, I can't go on.
,SpongeBob:, The taste, Patrick, ,[pulls Patrick's tongue and slaps it.], Remember the taste!
,Patrick:, The taste. ,[Patrick gets up and stands on the table pointing.],
,Perch Perkins:, What's this? Patrick Star has risen from his seat, and is pointing to center field,,[points somewhere else.], No wait! He's pointing to a little boy with a hurt foot. ,[Patrick points to his mouth.], Ladies and gentleman, he's pointing to his mouth, as if to indicate something
,Boy with a Broken Foot:, ,[holds out a Krabby Patty.], Here you go champ, you can have one. ,[Patrick sticks his tongue out and  the boy puts the Krabby Patty in his mouth and his taste buds carry it to his mouth, and then he eats and finishes it.],
,Perch Perkins:, And, he's eating! He's eating! The Great Starbino, is eating! ,[Patrick's nine hundred ninety nine became a thousand and broke the counting machine, and the crowd is cheering.], Patrick Star wins! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom! The belt is back in Bikini Bottom!
,Commissioner:, Here you go son, you earned it fat and square. ,[Patrick holds up the belt and puts it on],
,Perch Perkins:, Congratulations, Starbino. So, are you gonna defend the belt next year?
,Patrick:, No, this thing doesn't even fit! ,[ tries to get it off and then shoots off of him and hits the Boy with a Broken Foot.],
,Boy with a Broken Foot:, Ow! My other foot.
,[the screen fades to black and then the episode ends.],

"SpongeBob:, ,[frantically jumps out of bed], Good morning, Gary! Good morning, Mister Mailman!
,Mailman:, Morning, SpongeBob. Ah, it is a good morning, isn't it. ,[The Mailman crashes into a truck on his bicycle and flies across the sky], AAAHHH!
,SpongeBob:, Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends...
,Squidward:, Ah, stay away! Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare.
,SpongeBob:, The best job...
,Mr. Krabs:, He's already 10 seconds late. I'm docking him a month's pay for this.
,SpongeBob:, And, of course, the bestest pet.
,Gary:, Meow. ,[SpongeBob squeezes Gary in a hug, which causes Gary's shell to break. SpongeBob runs out of his house],
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! ,[runs into Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hey Patrick! How goes it?
,Patrick:, Well, it was great until you showed up. ,[turns around and shows a cake splattered on his belly],
,SpongeBob:, What's that?
,Patrick:, Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to bake a second birthday cake that'll give my mother a day late! Idiot Boy!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company. ,[SpongeBob goes to the door of Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Idiot Boy! ,[Cut to the Treedome, where Sandy has invented a robot],
,Sandy:, It's all done! My greatest invention yet! ,[the robot starts to dance],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! What a neat robot! ,[SpongeBob trips on a log. Some of the water from his helmet goes onto Sandy's robot],
,Sandy:, No!! ,[Sandy's robot blows up],
,SpongeBob:, Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise.
,Sandy:, Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. look at the surprise I got! ,[she shows the destroyed robot then pushes SpongeBob out], Get out of here! Idiot Boy!
,SpongeBob:, I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not! ,[Cut to the Krusty Krab], SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping.
,SpongeBob:, No worries, captain! ,[SpongeBob trips on some frying pans], Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up... ,[SpongeBob slides on a puddle of water and starts screaming],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[playing with his dollars, laughing], Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar. ,[hears SpongeBob's screaming], What the barnacles is going on?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! ,[SpongeBob slides and hits Mr Krabs. Mr. Krabs falls in the fryer and gets out immediately], Mr. Krabs, are you OK?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm fine, as long as me money's OK. ,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs notice both dollars in the fryer],
,Mr. Dollar:, ,[to Mrs. Dollar], Although we know each other a short time, I want you to know... I love you. ,[both dollars disintegrate as they cry. SpongeBob laughs nervously],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[kicks out SpongeBob], If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy! ,[SpongeBob is shocked and alarmed],
,SpongeBob:, I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me ""Idiot Boy"", it must be true. I know what must be done! ,[SpongeBob starts crying his tears, creating a river that leads him to his house], I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gary?
,[We see Gary putting a bandage on his back. He hisses at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you. ,[walks out of his house and turns around], Goodbye, pineapple. ,[the chimney blows SpongeBob up in the sky], Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it. ,[he lands on the road next to the sign], Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538. ,[crosses out the ""8"" with a chalk and puts a ""7"" next to it], Minus 1. ,[he leaves Bikini Bottom down the road], Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy... ,[that night, SpongeBob is scared by a bunch of very weird people. He runs for his life, but falls off the cliff upside down, causing him to hit his head on a bunch of rocks until he reaches the bottom of the cliff. Now he's got a long bump on his head], Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump. I better not hit my head again. That might cause a concussion. ,[the things that SpongeBob packed hit him on the head, causing him to faint. Cut to Patrick, who is knocking on SpongeBob's door and drinking a milkshake],
,Sandy:, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?
,Patrick:, I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake. ,[drinks his milkshake],
,Sandy:, We ain't got time for that. Hi-yah! ,[brushes through the door],
,Gary:, Mrloooow.
,Sandy:, Gary? Where are you, little guy? ,[searches for Gary],
,Gary:, Mrloooow.
,Sandy:, Gary? Gary? ,[bumps on some of Gary's snail slime on his bottom. Cut to see that Gary is now extremely huge and overweight],
,Gary:, Mrloow.
,Sandy:, Gary! What happened to you?
,Gary:, Mrlooooooowrooowroowrooow. ,[Sandy sees a note on Gary's food bowl],
,Sandy:, A note. ,[picks up the note and reads it], To whom it may concern: if you found this letter, that means Gary's food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled. It also means it's been approximately one year since I've split town, and no one's noticed 'til now. No one needs to worry, I won't bother anyone again. Sincerely, SpongeBob. A.K.A. Idiot Boy. ,[Patrick and Sandy look at each other sadly. Cut to SpongeBob, who wakes up when he hears villagers],
,Villager Man:, I could use this.
,Villager Woman:, Yeah, I like these here.
,Villager Man:, This is top quality.
,CheeseHead:, Hello there. ,[the villagers gasp], What's going on?
,Villager Man:, Oh, we thought you were taking a dirt nap, but we organized your clothes for you... SpongeBob.
,CheeseHead:, ,[looks behind, then turns around to the villagers], Are you talking to me?
,Villager Man:, Isn't this your name? ,[shows SpongeBob's nametag],
,CheeseHead:, I don't know, is it?
,Villager Man:, You don't know your name?
,CheeseHead:, All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything. ,[the villagers wink at each other],
,Villager Man:, Err, well, then I'll remind you that these are not your clothes, and your name isn't SpongeBob, it's, umm... it's... CheeseHead BrownPants. Ha ha! That's it!
,CheeseHead:, CheeseHead, huh? ,[checks his pockets], Wait a minute, what's this? ,[shows a bubble bottle],
,Villager Man:, Bubbles?!
,[The villagers scream and run away],
,CheeseHead:, I wonder what got into them? ,[Sees the town called ""New Kelp City"". Cut to a ""BREAKING NEWS"" slide],
,Perch Perkins:, We interrupt this program for an important announcement. ,[cut to Perch Perkins in Bikini Bottom, where a crowd of people are panicking], Bikini Bottom is literally in a state of total chaos tonight. ,[a muscular guy pushes Perch],
,Muscular Guy:, ,[yelling on screen], Literally! ,[runs off],
,Perch Perkins:, ,[gets up weakly with a black eye], We go now to news scene chopper 7. What's up?
,News Chopper:, ,[we see someone flying in a helicopter], Not looking too good out here, Perch. The Krusty Krab is about to come apart of the hinges. Customers are in a rage over not getting their Krabby Patties.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[running to Squidward], Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!
,Squidward:, If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't talk back to your superior officer, you...
,[Both start arguing. Sandy comes in],
,Sandy:, Squidward! Mr. Krabs! Y'all seen SpongeBob?
,Squidward:, I think we just went through this...
,Mr. Krabs:, What he means to say is, no, we haven't.
,Sandy:, Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back. ,[hands Mr. Krabs the note],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me see that. ,[begins to read], To whom that may concern, if you found this letter, that means ,[muttering], sincerely... AKA! AKA? Idiot Boy? IDIOT BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?
,Patrick:, What am I gonna do without my best friend? I should never have been mean to you! ,[starts to cry],
,Sandy:, I should have never kicked you out of my house! ,[starts to cry. Her helmet fills up with tears],
,Squidward:, ,[sadly], If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob-- ,[happily], I would have slammed the door in his face even harder! ,[starts laughing. Everyone except Squidward and Mr. Krabs is very sad. Mr. Krabs pushes the customers out of the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, all right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice! ,[closes the doors], Now... ,[he and the others gather around], how do you propose we find me money-making employee?
,[Cut to SpongeBob in the streets of New Kelp City],
,CheeseHead:, Whoo, I live in a dump! ,[bumps into a green fish],
,Fish:, Hey, watch where your stepping!
,CheeseHead:, Sorry, sir, I was just-
,Fish:, I know what you was doing. You was doing the old ""bump into the sucker and reach into his pockets and take his change"" routine, but it ain't gonna work this time. You want money? Get a job, you deadbeat!
,CheeseHead:, I'm a jobless deadbeat? What a sad existence I don't remember I live. ,[fade to black. Cut back to SpongeBob. His tummy is grumbling], Ooh, seems like I'm running on empty. ,[checks his pockets and sighs], Not a penny to my name. Well, I guess if I want to fill the hole in my gut, I'll need to fill a job somewhere. ,[checks a bank sign that says ""Help Wanted""], Help wanted?
,Help Wanted Lady:, Well, Mr... BrownPants... you seem to have left this entire application blank.
,CheeseHead:, ,[laughs], I can't remember a thing.
,Help Wanted Lady:, Well, do you have any special skills?
,CheeseHead:, Special skills... oh, I can do this! ,[blows a bubble],
,Help Wanted Lady:, ,[screams], Oh, what do you think you're doing?! ,[kicks out SpongeBob], Sorry, sir, but we run a respectable business here! ,[she slams the door],
,CheeseHead:, Okay, I guess they don't want you blowing bubbles, unless it directly relates to the job at hand. ,[SpongeBob is hired as a builder], Thanks for the job, boss! You won't be disappointed.
,Builder:, That's real sweet, BrownPants, but I don't hear that hammer pounding.
,CheeseHead:, ,[pounding the hammer while flying on a bubble], Then this might be music to your ears.
,Builder:, ,[sees the bubble], Neptune's son, what are you doing? ,[gets down from the building], You aren't doing that on my building site! You're fired! ,[the bubble pops and SpongeBob falls down],
,CheeseHead:, I do not understand this. What is wrong with this city? Maybe it's not the city. Maybe it's me. ,[looks at a man from All That Glitters], Hey, mister, Look at me! Mister, look at me! Is there something wrong with me? ,[shows a gruesome look on his face, then he makes a snot bubble, the man screams and runs away. Cut to the Krusty Krab],
,Sandy:, Listen up, y'all! I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, You do?
,Sandy:, Yup, and it involves this. ,[shows a device], It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius.
,Squidward:, So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?
,Sandy:, You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find-- ,[Squidward smashes the device with a hammer, everyone gasps],
,Squidward:, Oops, I dropped it. ,[Mr. Krabs is furious. His nose rises and blows up like a balloon, then bursts],
,Mr. Krabs:, MR. SQUIDWARD!!! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape. And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea.
,Mr. Krabs:, If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever.
,Squidward:, Ha! Is that your version of a threat?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift.
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any- ,[gasps], Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Not so fast! ,[pushes Squidward], Bring back me number one fry cook first.
,[Cut to SpongeBob, who is cold in the streets of New Kelp City. He goes to get warm near a fire],
,Fish:, Real drag, isn't it? Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night?
,CheeseHead:, Yeah.
,Other Fish:, Heh, not for us... we're just waiting in line for a new video game.
,CheeseHead:, I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat. ,[sighs], You guys mind if I bubble?
,Fish:, ,[frightened], You can't do that here!!
,CheeseHead:, But... bubbles will steady the ol' nerves. Watch. ,[blows a bubble], See? Feeling better already.
,[everyone who sees the bubble screams and runs away],
,CheeseHead:, What could possibly be wrong with practicing the bubble arts? Seems like a harmless activity. ,[laughs], 
,[SpongeBob gets ready to blow another bubble, when he is approached by a gang who are snapping their fingers. When SpongeBob walks away slowly one of them grabs him],
,Bubble Poppin' Boy:, Do you have any... ,[the others continue snapping], I think we've made our point with the snapping! ,[They stop snapping], As I was saying... do you have any idea who we are?
,CheeseHead:, Um, wait... err, um... don't tell me, um...
,Bubble Poppin' Boy:, Don't answer. ,[laughs], I'll show ya. ,[turns around to show the back of his shirt, which says ""Bubble Poppin' Boys""], We call us the Bubble Poppin' Boys. And article 1 of our charter prohibits bubble blowing on our turf. ,[pops the bubble. Its water gets in his eyes and he gets angry, showing his red eyes], You see why we don't allow bubbles in our city? Fortunately, we have ways of dealing with careless bubble blowers like you. Let's rough him up, boys! ,[the gang is ready to beat SpongeBob, but he sheds his skin and runs away],
,Bubble Poppin' Boy:, Where'd he go? ,[sees SpongeBob run], After him!!
,[SpongeBob tries to hide from the Bubble Poppin' Boys, but they surround him. SpongeBob blows four bubbles to make a stairway. One of the Bubble Poppin' Boys climbs up a street light. SpongeBob then blows a bubble raft and hops on it],
,CheeseHead:, Ah, I'll be making this getaway in comfort. ,[The Bubble Poppin' Boys try to shoot down the bubble raft with slingshots. SpongeBob blows a bubble paddle and paddles away, but one of the slingshots pop the bubble raft and paddle, causing SpongeBob to fall. SpongeBob lands on the street safely, but the bottle of bubble soap spills, and the bubble wand falls in the sewer. The Bubble Poppin' Boys are running towards SpongeBob, but he sticks his hand into the spilled bubble soap and blows a big bubble to trap the Bubble Poppin' Boys, causing them to float up and out of New Kelp City],
,Man:, You- you did it! ,[grunts and runs over to SpongeBob], Do you realize what you've done?
,CheeseHead:, No.
,Man:, You have freed the city. Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town! ,[All of the citizens of New Kelp City come out and blow bubbles],
,All:, Thank you, CheeseBoy!
,Man #2:, What an amazing gift CheeseBoy has given us.
,CheeseHead:, Actually, it's CheeseHead. ,[a car appears. Its horn honks as a window rolls down, and the mayor of New Kelp City appears],
,Mayor:, Well, CheeseHead, this is a historic day for New Kelp City. You have rid this city of the Bubble Poppin' Boys, and restored bubble-blowing to the streets. ,[laughs], Something I wasn't able to do for 20 years as mayor. For this, I appoint you... ,[puts his hat on SpongeBob's head], mayor of New Kelp City!
,All:, ,[lifting up SpongeBob], All hail mayor CheeseHead!! ,[SpongeBob smiles. Cut to Patrick, Sandy and Squidward, who are still searching for SpongeBob],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob!
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, ,[lifts up the road], Buddy? You there? ,[puts the road down],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob! ,[points at the truck stop], Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! ,[they walk to the truck stop],
,Sandy:, There he is, guys!
,Patrick:, Huh? SpongeBob! ,[laughs and runs into Evelyn], Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter.
,Sandy:, That's not SpongeBob, Patrick. There's SpongeBob. ,[Patrick drops Evelyn. She points to the newspaper carrier],
,Patrick:, ,[yells], I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy! ,[breaks the glass with a brick and hugs the newspaper], You're safe now in my arms. ,[notices that the picture of SpongeBob on the newspaper is gone], Huh? Where'd you go now? ,[cries],
,Sandy:, Uh, Pat? All the ink came off on your belly.
,Patrick:, Oh.
,Sandy:, Now let's see what that little critter's up to. ,[reads], New mayor of... ,[gasps], SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!
,CheeseHead:, Citizens of New Kelp City. I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets or how to be a ""leader"" I not sure what a mayor is, but I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of new kelp or my name isn't CheeseHead BrownPants.
,Male Citizen:, Cheese Head Brown Pants?
,Man #3:, New Kelp City has brown-pants mania. [some people rip off there own pants to show them wearing brown pants like SpongeBob's, everyone cheers until Sandy interrupts]
,Sandy:, Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here but Bikini Bottom needs you back, SpongeBob.
,CheeseHead:, What's that?
,Sandy:, Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy.
,CheeseHead:, Oh, this is a surprise.
,Sandy:, Surprised I found you?
,CheeseHead:, No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel.
,Sandy:, ,[gasps], It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob.
,CheeseHead:, Sorry, Sandy. But I'd probably remember another underwater, talking weasel.
,Patrick:, You may not remember the weasel but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you? [Patrick rips off Sponge Bob's sleeve to reveal half of a tattoo that reads, Best Firends, Spring Break]
,CheeseHead:, I have no idea how that got there. All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, I'm mayor.
,Sandy:, You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back.
,CheeseHead:, Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave. These people need my leadership. In fact I'm late for a meeting.
,Sandy:, [SpongeBob enters a limo] SpongeBob, wait! ,[As the limo leaves it turns around which reveals Squidward is the one driving],
,Squidward:, Don't just stand there, get in.
,Sandy:, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Hurry up! ,[Patrick and Sandy enter the limo], Decorative egg, here I come. ,[limo is leaving New Kelp City, then reaches the Krusty Krab],
,Sandy:, Here it is! You must recognize this place.
,CheeseHead:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties.
,CheeseHead:, I was a fry cook before?
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye, the best in the business. Now get flipping.
,CheeseHead:, Look, guys, as much as I'd love to toil the days away flipping burgers, I think I'll just go back to my modest job as mayor of a major city.
,Squidward:, Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook you gotta pay up.
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg.
,Squidward:, Ohh It's BEU-TI-FUL! ,[Squidward is admiring his egg until he slips on the gresy spatlua which sends the egg flying] STOOOOOP! [when SpongeBob leaves the Krusty Krab, the egg crashes onto his head, Squidward is upset that his egg is destroyed, a bump rises on SpongeBob's head],
,Sandy:, You ok, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sand- ,[He looks around the Krusty Krab], Hey, I remember this place.
,Sandy:, SpongeBob's back!
,Mr. Krabs:, We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy. But we're glad you're back.
,SpongeBob:, I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Good-bye, everyone.
,Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs:, Huh? What? Oh, not again.
,Squidward:, He's leaving, again.
,Perch Perkins:, Stop what you're doing and don't go out that door. This is a KNKC special report. Panic in the streets of New Kelp City as rampant bubbles bring visibility down to 0. The angry citizens here blame the apocalyptic scene on Mayor CheeseHead BrownPants and his newly-enacted bubble policy. ,[another muscular fish pushes him on the screen],
,Construction Fish:, If I ever see Mayor Brown Pants again I'm gonna grab his little, yellow head and literally rip his- ,[screen changes to ""We Are Experiencing Technical Difficulties""],
,Mr. Krabs:, Where's SpongeBob?
,[SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, ,[rings a bell], Order up! ,[hands a Krabby Patty on plate],
,Mr. Krabs:, Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town?
,SpongeBob:, And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friend?
,Patrick:, Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Krabby Patty! [he eats the Krabby Patty] SpongeBob, another masterpiece.
,Sandy:, It's great to have you back, Spongey.
,SpongeBob:, [Sighs] Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever.
,[In the background cows are mooing. Squidward opens his head, removes his brain, and throws into a trashcan],

"[Episode begins outside of SpongeBob's house at night. SpongeBob’s foghorn alarm goes off, making sheets fly off of SpongeBob's bed. His eye literally peel open],
,SpongeBob:, ,[frantically jumps out of bed and bounces off walls landing in front of Gary], Good morning, Gary! ,[looks out window], Good morning, Mr. Mailman!
,Mailman:, Morning, SpongeBob. Ah, it is a good morning, isn't it. ,[The Mailman crashes into a truck on his bicycle and flies across the sky], Ah!
,SpongeBob:, Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends...
,Squidward:, Ah, stay away! Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare.
,SpongeBob:, The best job...
,[at the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, He's already ten seconds late! I'm docking him a month's pay for this.
,SpongeBob:, And, of course, the bestest pet.
,Gary:, Meow. ,[SpongeBob squeezes Gary in a hug, which causes Gary's shell to break. SpongeBob runs out of his house],
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! ,[runs into Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick! How goes it?
,Patrick:, Well, it was great until you showed up. ,[turns around and shows a cake splattered on his belly],
,SpongeBob:, What's that?
,Patrick:, Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. Idiot Boy!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company. ,[SpongeBob goes to the door of Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Idiot Boy. ,[Cut to the Treedome, where Sandy has invented a robot],
,Sandy:, It's all done! My greatest invention yet! ,[the robot starts to dance],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! What a neat robot! ,[SpongeBob trips on a log. Some of the water from his helmet goes onto Sandy's robot],
,Sandy:, No! ,[Sandy's robot blows up],
,SpongeBob:, Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise.
,Sandy:, Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. Look at the surprise I got! ,[she shows the destroyed robot then pushes SpongeBob out], Get out of here! Idiot Boy!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles], I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not! ,[Cut to the Krusty Krab], SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping.
,SpongeBob:, No worries, captain! ,[SpongeBob trips on some frying pans], Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up... ,[SpongeBob slides on a puddle of water and starts screaming],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[playing with his dollars, laughing], Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar. ,[hears SpongeBob's screaming], What the barnacles is going on?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! ,[SpongeBob slides and hits Mr Krabs. Mr. Krabs falls in the fryer and gets out immediately], Mr. Krabs, are you okay?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm fine, as long as me money's okay. ,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs notice both dollars in the fryer],
,Mr. Dollar:, ,[to Mrs. Dollar], Although we've only known each other a short time, I want you to know... I love you. ,[both dollars disintegrate as they cry. SpongeBob laughs nervously],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[kicks out SpongeBob], If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy! ,[SpongeBob is shocked and alarmed],
,SpongeBob:, ,[curls up into a little ball], I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me ""Idiot Boy"", it must be true, I know what must be done! ,[SpongeBob starts crying, his tears creating a river that leads him to his house. At his house, he packs his clothes], I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gare?
,[We see Gary chewing on a bandage on his back. He hisses at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you. ,[walks out of his house and turns around], Goodbye, pineapple. ,[the chimney blows SpongeBob up in the sky], Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it. ,[he lands on the road next to the sign], Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538. ,[crosses out the ""8"" with a chalk and puts a ""7"" next to it], Minus 1. ,[he leaves Bikini Bottom down the road], Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy... ,[that night, SpongeBob is scared by a bunch of very weird people. In the deleted scene, a scallop is crowing while he sees the weird people. He runs for his life, but falls off the cliff upside down, causing him to hit his head on a bunch of rocks until he reaches the bottom of the cliff. Now he's got a long bump on his head], Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump! I better not hit my head again. That might cause a concussion. ,[SpongeBob's hobo stick, containing the things that he packed, hits him on the head, causing him to faint. Cut to Patrick, who is knocking on SpongeBob's door and drinking a milkshake],
,Sandy:, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?
,Patrick:, I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake. ,[drinks his milkshake],
,Sandy:, We ain't got time for that. Hi-yah! ,[brushes through the door],
,Gary:, Mrloooow.
,Sandy:, Gary? Where are you, little guy? ,[searches for Gary],
,Gary:, Mrloooow.
,Sandy:, Gary? Gary? ,[bumps on some of Gary's snail slime on his bottom. Cut to see that Gary is now extremely huge and overweight],
,Gary:, Mrloow.
,Sandy:, Gary! What happened to you?
,Gary:, Mrlooooooowrooowroowrooow. ,[Sandy sees a note on Gary's food bowl],
,Sandy:, A note. ,[picks up the note and reads it], To whom it may concern: if you found this letter, that means Gary's food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled. It also means it's been approximately one year since I've split town, and no one's noticed 'til now. No one needs to worry, I won't bother anyone again. Sincerely, SpongeBob. A.K.A. Idiot Boy. ,[Patrick and Sandy look at each other sadly. Cut to SpongeBob, who wakes up when he hears villagers],
,Harold:, I could use this.
,Jennifer-Millie:, Yeah, I like these here.
,Harold:, This is top quality.
,SpongeBob:, Hello there. ,[the villagers gasp], What's going on?
,Harold:, Oh, we thought you were taking a dirt nap, but we organized your clothes for you... SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[having forgot who he is, SpongeBob looks behind himself, then turns around to the villagers], Are you talking to me?
,Harold:, Isn't this your name? ,[shows his nametag],
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, is it?
,Harold:, You don't know your name?
,SpongeBob:, All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything. ,[the villagers wink at each other],
,Harold:, Err, well, then I'll remind you that these are not your clothes, and your name isn't SpongeBob, it's, umm... it's... CheeseHead BrownPants. Ha ha! That's it!
,SpongeBob:, ,[now CheeseHead BrownPants], CheeseHead, huh? ,[checks his pockets], Wait a minute, what's this? ,[shows a bubble bottle],
,Harold:, Bubbles?!
,[The villagers scream and run away],
,CheeseHead:, I wonder what got into them? ,[Sees the town called ""New Kelp City"". Cut to a ""BREAKING NEWS"" slide],
,Perch Perkins:, We interrupt this program for an important announcement. ,[cut to Perch Perkins in Bikini Bottom, where a crowd of people are panicking], Bikini Bottom is literally in a state of total chaos tonight. ,[a muscular guy pushes Perch],
,Muscular Guy:, ,[yelling on screen], Literally! ,[runs off],
,Perch Perkins:, ,[gets up weakly with a black eye], We go now to news scene chopper 7. What's up?
,News Chopper:, ,[we see someone flying in a helicopter], Not looking too good out here, Perch. The Krusty Krab is about to come apart of the hinges. Customers are in a rage over not getting their Krabby Patties.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[running to Squidward], Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!
,Squidward:, If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't talk back to your superior officer, you...
,[Both start arguing. Sandy comes in],
,Sandy:, Squidward! Mr. Krabs! Y'all seen SpongeBob?
,Squidward:, I think we just went through this...
,Mr. Krabs:, What he means to say is, no, we haven't.
,Sandy:, Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back. ,[hands Mr. Krabs the note],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me see that. ,[begins to read], To whom that may concern, if you found this letter, that means ,[muttering], sincerely... AKA...AKA? Idiot Boy? IDIOT BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?!
,Patrick:, What am I gonna do without my best friend?! I should never have been mean to you! ,[starts to cry],
,Sandy:, I should have never kicked you out of my house! ,[starts to cry. Her helmet fills up with tears],
,Squidward:, ,[crying], If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob-- ,[starts laughing], I would have slammed the door in his face even harder! ,[starts laughing. Everyone except Squidward and Mr. Krabs is very sad. Mr. Krabs pushes the customers out of the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice! ,[closes the doors], Now... ,[he and the others gather around], how do you propose we find me money-making employee?
,[Cut to CheeseHead BrownPants in the streets of New Kelp City],
,CheeseHead:, Whoo, I live in a dump! ,[bumps into a green fish],
,Fish:, Hey, watch where your stepping!
,CheeseHead:, Sorry, sir, I was just-
,Fish:, I know what you was doing. You was doing the old ""bump into the sucker and reach into his pockets and take his change"" routine, but it ain't gonna work this time. You want money? Get a job, you deadbeat!
,CheeseHead:, I'm a jobless deadbeat? What a sad existence I don't remember I live. ,[fade to black. Cut back to him. His tummy is grumbling], Ooh, seems like I'm running on empty. ,[checks his pockets and sighs], Not a penny to my name. Well, I guess if I want to fill the hole in my gut, I'll need to fill a job somewhere. ,[checks a bank sign that says ""Help Wanted""], Help wanted?
,Lisa:, Well, Mr... BrownPants... you seem to have left this entire application blank.
,CheeseHead:, ,[laughs], I can't remember a thing.
,Lisa:, Well, do you have any special skills?
,CheeseHead:, Special skills... oh, I can do this! ,[blows a bubble],
,Lisa:, ,[screams], Oh, what do you think you're doing?! ,[kicks out CheeseHead], Sorry, sir, but we run a respectable business here! ,[she slams the door],
,CheeseHead:, Okay, I guess they don't want you blowing bubbles, unless it directly relates to the job at hand. ,[Now, he is hired as a builder], Thanks for the job, boss! You won't be disappointed.
,Builder:, That's real sweet, BrownPants, but I don't hear that hammer pounding.
,CheeseHead:, ,[pounding the hammer while flying on a bubble], Then this might be music to your ears.
,Builder:, ,[sees the bubble], Neptune's son, what are you doing? ,[gets down from the building], You aren't doing that on my building site! You're fired! ,[the bubble pops and CheeseHead falls down],
,CheeseHead:, I do not understand this. What is wrong with this city? Maybe it's not the city. Maybe it's me. ,[looks at a man from All That Glitters], Hey, mister, Look at me! Mister, look at me! Is there something wrong with me? ,[shows a gruesome look on his face, then he makes a snot bubble, the man screams and runs away. Cut to the Krusty Krab],
,Sandy:, Listen up, y'all! I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, You do?
,Sandy:, Yup, and it involves this. ,[shows a device], It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius.
,Squidward:, So, you're saying this thing can actually ,find, SpongeBob?
,Sandy:, You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find-- ,[Squidward smashes the device with a mallet],
,Sandy, Mr. Krabs and Patrick:, ,[gasp!],
,Squidward:, ,[holding the mallet while panting heavily like a maniac], Oops, I dropped it. ,[Mr. Krabs' nose inflates like a balloon, then bursts],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape! And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea.
,Mr. Krabs:, If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever.
,Squidward:, Ha! Is that your version of a threat?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift.
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any– ,[gasps], Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pushes Squidward], Not so fast! Bring back me number one fry cook first.
,[Cut to CheeseHead, who is cold in the streets of New Kelp City. He goes to get warm near a fire],
,Fish:, Real drag, isn't it? Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night?
,CheeseHead:, Yeah.
,Other Fish:, Heh, not for us... we're just waiting in line for a new video game.
,CheeseHead:, I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat. ,[sighs], You guys mind if I bubble?
,Fish:, ,[frightened], You can't do that here!
,CheeseHead:, But... bubbles will steady the ol' nerves. Watch. ,[blows a bubble], See? Feeling better already.
,[everyone who sees the bubble screams and runs away],
,CheeseHead:, What could possibly be wrong with practicing the bubble arts? ,[deleted scene only], Seems like a harmless activity. ,[laughs], 
,[CheeseHead BrownPants gets ready to blow another bubble, when he is approached by a gang who are snapping their fingers. When he walks away slowly one of them grabs him],
,Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader:, Do you have any... ,[the others continue snapping], I think we've made our point with the snapping! ,[They stop snapping], As I was saying... do you have any idea who we are?
,CheeseHead:, Um, wait... err, um... don't tell me, um...
,Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader :, Don't answer. ,[laughs], I'll show ya. ,[turns around to show the back of his shirt, which says ""Bubble Poppin' Boys""], We call us the Bubble Poppin' Boys. And article one of our charter prohibits bubble blowing on our turf. ,[pops the bubble. Its water gets in his eyes and he gets angry, showing his red eyes], You see why we don't allow bubbles in our city?! Fortunately, we have ways of dealing with careless bubble blowers like you. Let's rough him up, boys! ,[the gang is ready to beat CheeseHead, but he sheds his skin and runs away],
,Bubble Poppin' Boys Leader:, Where'd he go? ,[sees him run], After him!
,[CheeseHead tries to hide from the Bubble Poppin' Boys, but they surround him. He blows four bubbles to make a stairway. One of the Bubble Poppin' Boys climbs up a street light. He then blows a bubble raft and hops on it],
,CheeseHead:, Ah, I'll be making this getaway in comfort. ,[The Bubble Poppin' Boys try to shoot down the bubble raft with slingshots. CheeseHead blows a bubble paddle and paddles away, but one of the slingshots pop the bubble raft and paddle, causing him to fall. He lands on the street safely, but the bottle of bubble soap spills, and the bubble wand falls in the sewer. The Bubble Poppin' Boys are running towards him, but he sticks his hand into the spilled bubble soap and blows a big bubble to trap the Bubble Poppin' Boys, causing them to float up and out of New Kelp City],
,Man:, You- you did it! ,[grunts and runs over to CheeseHead], Do you realize what you've done?
,CheeseHead:, No.
,Man:, You have freed the city. Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town! ,[All of the citizens of New Kelp City come out and blow bubbles],
,All:, Thank you, CheeseBoy!
,Man #2:, What an amazing gift CheeseBoy has given us.
,CheeseHead:, Actually, it's CheeseHead. ,[a car appears. Its horn honks as a window rolls down, and the mayor of New Kelp City appears],
,Mayor:, Well, CheeseHead, this is a historic day for New Kelp City. You have rid this city of the Bubble Poppin' Boys, and restored bubble-blowing to the streets. ,[laughs], Something I wasn't able to do for 20 years as mayor. For this, I appoint you... ,[puts his hat on CheeseHead's head], mayor of New Kelp City!
,All:, ,[lifting up CheeseHead], All hail mayor CheeseHead! ,[He smiles. Cut to Patrick, Sandy and Squidward, who are still searching for the yellow sponge.],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob!
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, ,[lifts up the road], Buddy? You there? ,[puts the road down],

,Patrick:, SpongeBob! ,[they walk to the truck stop],
,Sandy:, There he is, guys!
,Patrick:, Huh? SpongeBob! ,[laughs and runs into Shubie], Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter.
,Sandy:, That's not SpongeBob, Patrick. ,[Patrick drops Shubie], here's SpongeBob. ,[She points to the newspaper carrier],
,Patrick:, ,[yells], I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy! ,[breaks the glass with a brick and hugs the newspaper], You're safe now in my arms. ,[notices that the picture of SpongeBob on the newspaper is gone], Huh? Where'd you go now? ,[cries],
,Sandy:, Uh, Pat? All the ink came off on your belly.
,Patrick:, Oh.
,Sandy:, Now let's see what that little critter's up to. ,[reads], New mayor of... ,[gasps], SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!
,Mayor CheeseHead:, ,[He is giving a speech to the citizens with a gleeful Patrick and a surprised Sandy and Squidward in the audience], Citizens of New Kelp City. I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets or how to be a ""leader"". I'm not exactly sure what a ""mayor…is."" But I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat, it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of New Kelp or my name isn't CheeseHead BrownPants.
,Sandy:, CheeseHead BrownPants?
,Man #3:, New Kelp City has brown-pants mania. [some people rip off there own pants to show them wearing brown pants like the mayor's, everyone cheers until Sandy interrupts]
,Sandy:, Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here, but Bikini Bottom needs you back, SpongeBob.

,Sandy:, Surprised I found you?
,Mayor CheeseHead:, No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel.
,Sandy:, ,[gasps], It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob.
,Mayor CheeseHead:, Sorry, Sandy. But I'd probably remember another underwater, talking weasel.
,Patrick:, You may not remember the weasel, but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you? ,[Patrick rips off the mayor's sleeve to reveal half of a tattoo that reads, ""Best Friends, Spring Break],
,Mayor CheeseHead:, I have no idea how that got there. All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, I'm mayor.
,Sandy:, You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back.
,Mayor CheeseHead:, Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave. These people need my leadership. In fact, I'm late for a meeting.
,Sandy:, ,[Mayor CheeseHead BrownPants enters a limo], SpongeBob, wait! ,[As the limo leaves it turns around, which reveals Squidward is the one driving],
,Squidward:, Don't just stand there, get in.
,Sandy:, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Hurry up! ,[Patrick and Sandy enter the limo], Decorative egg, here I come. ,[limo is leaving New Kelp City, then reaches the Krusty Krab],
,Sandy:, Here it is! You must recognize this place.

,Mr. Krabs:, All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg.
,Squidward:, Ohh It's BEAU-TI-FUL! ,[Squidward sobs with excitement and is admiring his egg until he slips on a greasy spatlua, which sends the egg flying], STOOOOOP! ,[when the mayor leaves the Krusty Krab, the egg crashes onto his head. Squidward is upset that his egg is destroyed, a bump rises on the yellow sponge's head],

,Sandy, Mr. Krabs and Patrick:, What? / Huh? / Oh, not again.
,Squidward:, He's leaving, again!
,Perch Perkins:, Stop what you're doing and don't go out that door. ,[SpongeBob stops and looks at the TV in the Krusty Krab], This is a KNKC special report.

,Construction Fish:, If I ever see Mayor Brown Pants again I'm gonna grab his little, yellow head and literally rip his!-- ,[screen changes to ""We Are Experiencing Technical Difficulties. Share the frustration.""],
,Mr. Krabs:, Where's SpongeBob?
,[SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, ,[rings a bell], Order up! ,[hands a Krabby Patty on plate], Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town? And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friend? 
,Patrick:, Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, Krabby Patty! ,[he eats the Krabby Patty], SpongeBob, another masterpiece.
,Sandy:, It's great to have you back, Spongy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever.

"[opens up with Pearl sleeping until the radio wakes her up],
,Radio:, Good morning, Bikini Bottom! It's a very special day today because we have got the new single from Boys Who Cry: 'It's All About You'.
,Boys Who Cry:, ,[singing], It's all about you girl, On your sixteenth birthday! Pay attention to you girl, Everyone has to do just what you say. ,[A spotlight shines on Pearl], You get your very own spotlight tonight, Cuz it's all about you! Yeah, it's all about Pearl! You're the birthday girl!
,Pearl:, ,[singing], Yeah! It's all about me. On my 16th birthday, I want music, clothes, and shiny things. So give it up right away, Everybody in the whole wide world. They have to pay attention to me. It's all about me, me...and guess who? Me! ,[wakes up from her dream], Oops!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Pearl crashes through the ceiling and into the kitchen on the ground floor], Neptune's trousers!
,Pearl:, Morning, daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a room on the ground floor?
,Pearl:, Oh, daddy. I'm just excited because tomorrow's a very special day.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gulps], It is? ,[Pearl glares at him], Oh, I mean, it is! Very special! Very, very special, indeed!
,Pearl:, You have no idea what day tomorrow is, do you?
,Mr. Krabs:, None at all.
,Pearl:, IT'S MY 16TH BIRTHDAY! ,[outside Mr. Krabs house is lifted over the bubble],
,Mr. Krabs:, I knew that! How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?
,Pearl:, I'm going to be 16! It's only the most important birthday in my entire life. If I don't have a completely awesome party, my whole high school reputation will collapse. I'll have to drop out, I won't go off to college, I'll never leave home. You'll have to support me for the rest of my life.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[nervously chuckles], Well, we don't want that to happen.
,Pearl:, Then promise me you'll give me a real party this year. And don't be cheap! ,[Mr. Krabs nods. Later at the high school], Hi, girls.
,Friend #1:, Hi, Pearl.
,Pearl:, Are you guys coming to my totally coral birthday party tomorrow?
,Friend #1:, I don't know, Pearl. Is this going to be as totally coral as last year, when your dad passed out paper clips as party favors? ,[the girls laugh],
,Judy:, Remember the time we all had to share one balloon? ,[balloon floats up], Please.
,Friend #2:, Remember the pony ride? ,[wooden horse with a paint can as a head and a broom stick as a tail],
,Friend #1:, I can't wait to see how he ruins this year. ,[the girls laugh as Pearl runs out of school, crying. She heads towards the Krusty Krab],
,Pearl:, Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-oh. Everybody, brace for impact!
,Pearl:, Tell me you've got something totally coral planned for my birthday party.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors, bubble wrap! ,[pops the bubble wrap], This year's gonna be a blast.
,Pearl:, Daddy, you ruined all my birthday parties, but you better not ruin this one. Now promise me you won't be cheap!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gulps], I promise.
,Pearl:, Good, because I made a list. ,[list rolls out of the Krusty Krab and down the road. Mr Krabs rolls it up], Now I want everything on this list at my party. ,[kisses her dad], Bye. I'll be at the mall with my friends.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present. ,[takes out his credit card], Here you go, boy.
,SpongeBob:, What's this, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.
,SpongeBob:, I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?
,Mr. Krabs:, Exactly.
,SpongeBob:, Wow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.
,SpongeBob:, Detective work. I'm going undercover.
,[later at the Bikini Bottom Mall],
,Pearl:, So, that's when Marcy told me that Julie said that Angela did like Brad.
,Friend #1:, Oh.
,SpongeBob:, ,[peeking through a plant as he writes something down on a notepad], Angela likes Brad.
,Pearl:, ,[holding up a purple, plastic comb], Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing I have seen in the whole world.
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up to the cashier], I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic. ,[giggles],
,Cashier:, ,[looking at the credit card], Mr. Krabs, huh? Quick, how do you spell ""Krabs""?
,SpongeBob:, Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.
,Cashier:, Close enough. ,[swipes the credit card through the machine], There you go, kid.
,SpongeBob:, That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance.
,Pearl:, ,[holding up lip gloss], Wow, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in the whole world. Glitter gloss!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, I bought the wrong present.
,Judy:, Pearl, you have got to see this.
,Pearl:, Coming, Judy.
,Mary:, Oh...hmmm... ,[mirror flips around revealing SpongeBob. He takes the glitter gloss away from the elderly fish and the mirror flips back around],
,SpongeBob:, Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.
,Pearl:, ,[squeals], This is the greatest thing in the whole world! ,[SpongeBob sighs. Back at the Krusty Krab where Squidward is nailing down a banner],
,Squidward:, The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale.
,Squidward:, I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs.
,[back at the mall],
,Pearl:, This sea pony is the cutest thing ever. Do you want to come home and be my pony? ,[pony imagines Pearl being on its back], Whee! ,[pony shakes its head],
,Judy:, Pearl, come here. This is so coral. ,[SpongeBob is disguised as a dog fish next to the pony],
,Pearl:, Oh my gosh, it's Billy Fishkins.
,All:, Hi, Billy!
,Billy:, Meep. ,[all sighing. SpongeBob, dressed up as a girl, sighs after they do],
,SpongeBob:, ,[girly voice], Isn't he dreamy? ,[SpongeBob takes Billy and hands him to the cashier],
,Cashier:, Price check on 4.
,Billy:, Meep.
,[Back at the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece. ,[reveals a meat sculpture of Pearl],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.
,Squidward:, Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.
,Squidward:, Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.
,Mr. Krabs:, You're a real fan, huh?
,Squidward:, Oh, yeah, I know all their songs.
,Mr. Krabs:, All their songs?
,[Back at the mall where Pearl and her friends are gazing at a bunch of things and SpongeBob buys them all, including a dress, sunglasses, a pair of platform shoes, and other gifts.],
,Pearl:, Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?
,Friend #1:, It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not. ,[laughs],
,Pearl:, Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples. ,[SpongeBob appears on the boat.],
,[back at the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's almost time for the party to start!
,SpongeBob:, I'm back, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?
,SpongeBob:, The delivery truck will be here momentarily.
,Squidward:, Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Everybody, get into position. ,[Pearl and friends enter],
,All:, Happy birthday! ,[everyone is standing in front of the banner that reads 'IT'S A ,BOY, GIRL'],
,Judy:, ""It's a boy""?! ,[the girls laugh],
,Pearl:, Daddy! ,[Pearl’s friends walk over to the popcorn machine and try a bite. All gag & cough up the popcorn],
,Friend #1:, Stale popcorn. ,[they walk over to the punch bowl and take a sip], It tastes like dishwater.
,Squidward:, It is dishwater. ,[the girls cough out the punch],
,Pearl:, ,[notices the sculpture], Is that supposed to be me? ,[head falls off], It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross!
,Mr. Krabs:, Who wants cake?
,Pearl:, Well, the cake does look good. ,[all take a bite, but spit it right back out], It's made out of cardboard!
,Mr. Krabs:, And frosting.
,Friend #1:, Well, Pearl, sixteen lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.
,Pearl:, Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, even better, sweetie. Hit it. ,[curtain unfolds as R & B Music beings to play with Squidward standing on the stage],
,Squidward:, Hello, ladies. ,[sings], When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!
,Friend #2:, Hey, that is not Boys Who Cry.
,Judy:, Yeah!
,Friend #2:, Boo!
,Friend #1:, What a rip-off!
,Judy:, This stinks!
,Pearl:, Daddy, how could you? I... gave... you... a list! ,[runs out crying],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pearl, come back! ,[crowd throws Pearl’s meat head at Squidward],
,Pearl:, You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me. ,[cries],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.
,SpongeBob:, That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go! ,[the dump truck full of presents unloads them all],
,Pearl:, You bought me a boat?
,Mr. Krabs:, I did? I mean...I did?!
,Friends:, Wow.
,Pearl:, Oh, daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.
,SpongeBob:, Just watch. ,[signals on his walkie-talkie], Hit it, boys! ,[big present at the top opens up],
,Endsong:, Boys Who Cry ""It's All About You""
,It's all about you girl, On your sixteenth birthday! Pay attention to you girl, Everyone has to do just what you say. You get your very own spotlight tonight, Cuz it's all about you! Yeah, it's all about Pearl! You're the birthday girl!
,Mr. Krabs:, Boy, how much is all this costing me?
,SpongeBob:, Here's the receipt.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[freaks out], I ought to...
,Pearl:, Oh, daddy, you got me everything I wanted. ,[kisses her dad],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.
,SpongeBob:, You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't push your luck, boy.

"[The episode opens with Squidward sleeping at the Krusty Krab with a magazine on his face until Mr. Krabs takes it off],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[screams], What is your problem?
,Mr. Krabs:, My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!
,Squidward:, Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?
,Mr. Krabs:, Tentacles, I mean it! ,[pointing to Squidward again], You get back to mindin' that register!
,Squidward:, Minding it for ,[pointing at an empty Krusty Krab], which customer?
,Mr. Krabs:, I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob's got that covered.
,SpongeBob:, ,[mops the floor while humming, and as he sweeps, he comes across the window, causing his eye to protrude out, then he gasps], Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered! ,[generates an extra arm with a window wiper and wipes the window], That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking! ,[makes his way to the kitchen sink by stretching his body and begins humming again],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!
,Squidward:, I ,was, busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!
,SpongeBob:, Already done, sir! ,[comes sliding off the wall, then a shot of a sparkling Krusty Krab is shown],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task.
,SpongeBob:, Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!
,Mr. Krabs:, Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep-- ,[hears a noise in the ducts and looks up at them and a dirty SpongeBob coming out of the ducts],
,SpongeBob:, Done and dusted! ,[coughs up a puff of smoke],
,Squidward:, Nice working conditions, but, no thanks! ,[grabs his magazine],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, is that so? ,[lifts the bottom of one of the tables with gum underneath], Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!
,Squidward:, Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes.
,SpongeBob:, ,[while pulling off a piece of gum from the underside of another table], Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't. ,[pulls on the gum, then sticks on a giant ball of chewed gum], Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars! ,[puts a pair of shoes on the edge of the cashier boat], Like shinin' me shoes!
,Squidward:, Sorry, all out of polish.
,SpongeBob:, ,[appears out of the boat, then polishes the shoes], Well, I'm not!
,Mr. Krabs:, Wash me boat! ,[spots SpongeBob outside the Krusty Krab, filling himself up with water and washing the boat while humming], Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another.
,Squidward:, It doesn't matter what you ""want"" me to do, I won't do it!
,[Mr. Krabs gets really angry and his face turns purple, however, he gets an idea.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible.
,SpongeBob:, ,[coming in from washing Mr. Krabs' boat], Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, For...for... ,[thinks for a second], ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gulps], The Yeti Krab?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[comes close to SpongeBob], Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab... ,[pulls his eyebrows longer], ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs... ,[shows his teeth], ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers. ,[comes close to Squidward], He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You ,will, be eaten!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward and I are as close as brothers!
,Squidward:, Ludicrous.
,Mr. Krabs:, You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya! ,[chuckles], Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute. ,[while putting dirty clothes on the order boat], But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or...
,SpongeBob:, Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!
,Mr. Krabs:, Precisely. See ya, boys! ,[steps out of the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, Whatever. ,[relaxes],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, what are you doing? ,[sniffs], Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!
,Squidward:, ,[picks up a pair of underwear], You sure it's not ,these, you're smelling?
,SpongeBob:, If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna... ,[his nose pops like a balloon], you know, ,[whispers], eat us!
,Squidward:, Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!
,Squidward:, You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies.
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Squidward! ,[SpongeBob forms into a washing machine and takes Mr. Krabs' dirty laundry], Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay. ,[puts the laundry in his mouth, then puts laundry soap through his head, turns his eye like a knob to delicate, and pulls his nose to start the washing process],
,Narrator:, Just then... By sheer coincidence...
,[Cuts to the mountain tops where a mysterious monster with red crab claws and white fur is lurking. The monster is revealed to be the Yeti Krab that was mentioned by Mr. Krabs earlier. The Yeti Krab sniffs the air and walks menacingly towards Bikini Bottom. He stops and sniffs a sign with an arrow and the word ,Bikini Bottom, on it. He smashes it with his claws and continues walking. He stops and sniffs at a mailbox. He takes a bite of it but spits it out. He continues walking until he stops at a department store named ,Gramma's Closet,. He sniffs the window and growls at it. He continues to walk until he feels a growling motion in his body. It shows his heart, lungs, and stomach. The stomach looks more agitated than the heart and lungs.],
,Yeti Krab's stomach:, Let me out of here, you hairy brute! I can find my own food!
,[The Yeti Krab roars in disgust and hunger until he smells the scent of Krabby Patties. He immediately runs to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob in cleaning the tables.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[hears someone at the door], Good day, sir. Are you ,Yeti, to order? ,[notices the Yeti Krab is behind him and runs towards Squidward who is sound asleep], Oh, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[wakes up], What? What? What? Wha... huh?
,SpongeBob:, You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed? ,[The Yeti Krab roars at SpongeBob and Squidward in the faces], Didn't brush this morning. Did we?
,SpongeBob:, Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!
,Squidward:, ,[sits back and relaxes], Oh, yes I am.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness! ,[runs to the tables and pushes some chairs in. The Yeti Krab walks up to SpongeBob as the young fry cook chuckles nervously. However, the table starts to wobble], A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that! ,[SpongeBob sticks a door stopper underneath one side of the table stand, but the table continues to wobble. SpongeBob places another door stopper on the other side, but it still continues to wobble.], Come on. No. ,[SpongeBob continues to fix the table as the Yeti Krab grows impatient and growls.], There! Perfect! ,[The table now has a huge stack of door stoppers underneath. SpongeBob walks to the condiment dispensers and opens the mustard.], Yikes! Time to top off the mustard! ,[SpongeBob pulls a large bag of mustard, rips it open, and over fills the dispenser. SpongeBob then runs into the kitchen towards the spice rack.], See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color! ,[The Yeti Krab sniffs some of the spices, but sneezes really hard. The force of he sneeze makes SpongeBob bounce around the kitchen. SpongeBob slams on the wall and slides down next to the grease trap door.], Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again. ,[opens the door and reveals bubbling grease underneath. SpongeBob takes a large barrel and begins to absorb the grease with his left arm and foot. He uses his right arm and foot to fill up the barrel and SpongeBob sighs in relief. The Yeti Krab takes one sample of grease, sniffs it, and eats it with his claw. SpongeBob becomes startled and grease spits out of his body.], I'm not lazy! Don't eat me! ,[The grease is sprayed on the Yeti Krab and he aggressively roars. The scene cuts to the lazy Squidward reading the newspaper.], I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod. ,[Then drops of varnishing liquid splatters in the newspaper and on Squidward's hat], What the? Do you mind?
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob is upside-down, mopping the ceiling with varnishing liquid], Sorry, Squidward! Just varnishing the ceiling!
,Squidward:, ,[turns to the Yeti Krab], Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane! ,[The Yeti Krab growls at Squidward], Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever. ,[The Yeti Krab roars real loudly until sparks causes him to back away. The sparks burn Squidward's newspaper to the crisp.], Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob is burning the metal shut on Mr. Krabs' office door],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Takes off the mask], Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!
,SpongeBob:, Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do! ,[SpongeBob gets off his chair and carries a pile of toilet paper to the bathroom], I can replenish the toilet paper! ,[Then runs with a bucket of paint and a paint roller], And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office! ,[Then sits to the table and makes origami with some napkins], And refold the napkins into origami figures! ,[Then knits some things with yarn and needles], Knit straw cozies! ,[The straws are covered in knitted cozies. SpongeBob then sprays a bar of soap with the dishwasher hose], Clean the soap! ,[Then cleans grill with a surface waxer], Re-clean the grill! ,[Goes outside the kitchen], Washing inside the walls! ,[Slides into the wall and comes back out covered in filth. Then takes a vacuum and sweeps the table with it.], Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant! ,[SpongeBob sucks Squidward's newspaper with the vacuum.],
,Squidward:, Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!
,SpongeBob:, Lost it? ,[chuckles nervously], Lost it? ,[chuckles], What a silly thing to say! ,[His vacuum sucks SpongeBob's hat. SpongeBob becomes more nervous and runs in panic],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], Guess I'm down to the comic section. ,[SpongeBob backs up in fear and jump in front of Squidward.],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do! ,[hugs Squidward], I have done it all! ,[The Yeti Krab slashes the newspaper in pieces with his claws and roars viciously], Which means he is gonna eat us! ,[The Yeti Krab chases SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, That does it! ,[Squidward goes to through the back door where the dumpster is], I have had it with this ridiculous ruse! ,[He takes an empty trash bin and stuck his feet through. Then he jumps on two empty shoe boxes and made them look like shoes.], Using fear to prey on a feeble mind! ,[Digs through the garbage and pulls out an old cushion.], Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that! ,[Takes some of the stuffing out and puts some on his face, arms and legs to look like fur. He then takes a mop and rips it off the stick.], Enjoy spooking the witless, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it. ,[Puts the mop on his head and sticks his eyes out through like crab eyes. The Yeti Krab is about to attack SpongeBob until Squidward bursts in with his disguise.], Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too! ,[The Yeti Krab roars in Squidward's face.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Sweats uncontrollably], T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs! ,[SpongeBob cringes in fear as his brain pops and releases air. SpongeBob then passes out.],
,Squidward:, ,[Squidward is now on top of the Yeti Krab pulling his head], Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody! ,[At that same moment, the real Mr. Krabs shows up at the front door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm back, fellas!
,Squidward:, ,[Still pulling on the Yeti Krab's head], Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, Squidward?
,Squidward:, What? ,[Squidward looks for a minute at Mr. Krabs and the Yeti Krab. He is finally convinced that the Yeti Krab is real, not Mr. Krabs in disguise. He shrieks as the Yeti Krab glares at him. The Yeti Krab grabs Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and the unconscious SpongeBob, ties them to the grill and turns the heat up to cook.],
,Mr. Krabs:, We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Regains consciousness], Guys, do you hear that?
,Squidward:, You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp? ,[The Yeti Krab's stomach growls],
,SpongeBob:, No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me.
,[SpongeBob takes out a can of ""Emergency Krabby Patties"" out of his pocket with his feet and open it with his nose. He puts three patties on the grill and cooks them. Then he uses his feet to flip the patties with the spatula, puts them in buns with tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mustard on a plate and serves them to the Yeti Krab. The Yeti Krab sniffs the patties, eats them and is now fully satisfied with the meal he wanted.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Way to go, boy! He loves it! ,[The Yeti Krab pays Mr. Krabs with a dollar.], And look, he's a paying customer. ,[The Yeti Krab walks happily out of the Krusty Krab and heads back to the mountains.], Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab! ,[Mr. Krabs turns to SpongeBob and Squidward.], Hey, what are you two doing standing idle? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob takes a broom and runs.], Done! ,[Cuts to the outside of the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Refinish me floors!
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, Done!
,Mr. Krabs:, Build me a new safe!
,Squidward:, Nuh-uh.
,SpongeBob:, Consider it done!

"Narrator:, A slow day at the Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, check this out. ,[holds up a patty in each hand], Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become... ,[throws them on the floor and Patrick slides the patties across the room],
,Patrick:, A one-way ticket to pain! ,[slams into the wall by Mr. Krabs' office. Mr. Krabs' window breaks off the wall caused by the impact.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[puts down his writing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[slides while on Patrick's mouth], Heave-ho! ,[slams into the wall and the place shakes],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[exits his office], What the devil fish is going on out here?! ,[SpongeBob is on Patrick's mouth], Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money! ,[walks up to SpongeBob], And that's just sick!
,SpongeBob:, But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
,Mr. Krabs:, What stupid barnacle told you that?
,Squidward:, Uhh… ,[nervously holds up his magazine over his face],
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me. ,[scene cuts to the three of them standing in front of Mr. Krabs' house], Now, are you men ready for your Super...?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Super?
,Mr. Krabs:, Special...?
,Both:, Special?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[whispers], Secret...?
,Both:, ,[whisper], Secret?
,Mr. Krabs:, Assignment?
,Both:, ,[screaming], Assignment?!? I beg of you, Mr. Krabs! Put us out of our misery! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick get worried],
,Mr. Krabs:, The two of you are to paint the inside of me house! ,[opens his front door],
,Both:, Yay! ,[jumps out with excitement],
,Mr. Krabs:, But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent. ,[while showing paint cans, shoves cans toward SpongeBob and Patrick], It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off... ,[holds up two empty plaques, each with their names on it], …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job. ,[shuts the door with them inside his house],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Yeah, SpongeBob? ,[They see Mr. Krabs' wall; it is covered head to toe in memorabilia],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. ,[puts his paint on the floor], Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
,Patrick:, ,[puts his paint on the floor as well], No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.
,Patrick:, Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
,Patrick:, Good, just don't pay me.
,SpongeBob:, First, we need to set up the tarp. ,[holds up a tarp],
,Patrick:, Tarp ahoy! ,[spreads the tarp on the floor, but the camera pans to reveal it's a tiny piece],
,SpongeBob:, We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick. ,[scene cuts to more tarp on the floor but not the entire floor], Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
,Patrick:, That will never ever come off.
,SpongeBob:, And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
,Patrick:, And mount them on the wall. ,[SpongeBob takes a screwdriver and tries opening the lid], Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob! ,[screaming], Careful, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds the lid], Patrick, the lid's already off.
,Patrick:, Oh. Now it's my turn! ,[takes out a battle ax and hits the paint can with it. SpongeBob grabs the can],
,SpongeBob:, I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick! ,[carefully opens up the lid. When he does, a paint drop bounces on the tarp],
,Both:, ,[Screaming as the paint drop bounces on a tarp. Screaming again as the drop bounces on every tarp and then back into the can],
,Patrick:, Well, that was a rip-off. ,[SpongeBob wipes sweat off],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready. ,[holds up his big brush], Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush. ,[throws the big brush to the right of him then takes another small brush and gets a hair out of his nose. Patrick gets all his hairs out of his nose on his brush. SpongeBob dips the brush into the can and then faces the wall], All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.
,Narrator:, One hour later...
,SpongeBob:, ,[still standing in the same spot, while sweating nervously], Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.
,Narrator:, Two hours later...
,SpongeBob:, ,[still standing in the same spot and sweating], I'm getting to the painting.
,Narrator:, Three hours later... ,[Fourth wall breaks between these two lines],
,Patrick:, ,[Carrying the “Three Hours Later” time card], Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.
,SpongeBob:, ,[still standing on the same spot and sweating], No problem. Here I go. ,[makes a line of paint going down the wall. He smiles. The paint starts going down, but SpongeBob blows it one direction then another then another until he gets a blow dryer and blows the paint off the wall. Blows the steam off the hairdryer like a gun creating a giant paint bubble], Yeah! Huh?! ,[notices the big paint bubble], Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!
,Patrick:, Oh, I know! ,[takes a wand, dips it in the paint then blows a big bubble], Two giant paint bubbles!
,SpongeBob:, Noooooo! ,[two giant paint bubbles merge into one], Patrick?
,Patrick:, Yeah, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!
,Patrick:, ,[finds a bicycle pump and attaches it to the bubble], Nonsense! ,[starts pumping the bubble, inflating it further],
,SpongeBob:, Pat, no! ,[The bubble pops and the paint splatters all over the wall, covering up all the old brown spots. SpongeBob moves out of the way for the last bit of paint to splash on the wall], We did it! ,[checks the area], We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the-- ,[shocked], Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?! ,[Mr. Krabs' dollar on the wall has a dot of paint on it upon closer inspection. SpongeBob's eyes crack, break, and drip on the floor. He then falls over. He then wakes up and his eyes recover], We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
,Patrick:, Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
,SpongeBob:, That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
,Patrick:, I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, ,[takes the dollar off the wall], this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off. ,[tries to wipe the paint off with his tie but makes the paint even more noticeable], There! I think I got it. ,[notices the paint more. He becomes nervous so he wipes it more but the dollar becomes completely covered in paint. He screams],
,Patrick:, Oh, now I see it!
,SpongeBob:, This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar… ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick's butt on the wall while Mr. Krabs is enjoying some tea by the fire],
,Both:, ,[Both shriek while holding their butts],
,Patrick:, Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!
,SpongeBob:, But Mr. Krabs said…
,Patrick:, ,[claps his hands over SpongeBob's mouth], Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a washing machine],
,SpongeBob:, Did it work? ,[Patrick comes out from the washing machine with the dollar, still with paint on it, in his hands; he also has a bra on his head],
,Patrick:, Nope. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob sanding the dollar in Patrick's hand],
,SpongeBob:, Did it work? ,[Patrick's hands are gone],
,Patrick:, Nope.
,Patrick:, ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob squirting sulfuric acid out of a fire hose. Patrick screams in pain],
,SpongeBob:, Did it work? ,[Patrick holds up the dollar that left a hole in his body from the force of the acid, except for the part blocked by his arms],
,Patrick:, Nope. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob banging on the dollar Patrick is holding, while Patrick is wearing a neck brace and has a black eye; behind them is a huge assortment of weapons and tools that apparently didn't work either], Oof! Oof! Oof!
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds a club], Nothing's working!
,Patrick:, Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen! ,[walks over to a computer], We have technology! ,[picks up the computer and angrily grunts as he smashes it on the dollar],
,SpongeBob:, It didn't work.
,Patrick:, ,[Ranting as he puts the computer down], This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...
,SpongeBob:, Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
,Patrick:, I don't see where you're going with this... ,[takes out his wallet and pulls out a dollar], hey, a dollar!
,SpongeBob:, Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no! ,[Patrick puts his dollar in a vending machine], Patrick! No…why did you put it... ,[his dollar comes out], Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry! I... ,[Patrick pushes it back in], Aww, Pat, no, no! ,[dollar comes out again], Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it! ,[Patrick pushes it back in again and covers the hole so the dollar won't come out again], Oh, no-ho-oh!
,Patrick:, ,[eats a chocolate bar as he approaches an annoyed SpongeBob], Wanna bite?
,SpongeBob:, Okay, okay, we still have time! ,[looks in a mirror], Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome! ,[Mr. Krabs is approaching the door while singing, offscreen],
,SpongeBob's reflection:, You're on your own, pal. ,[walks away],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams as he runs in circles around Patrick], Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea! ,[Mr. Krabs enters his dark house where all the lights are off],
,Mr. Krabs:, What the…?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stammering], We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
,Patrick:, Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you. ,[lights turn on; they are grinning suspiciously],
,Mr. Krabs:, You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going... ,[he and Patrick are about to leave],
,Mr. Krabs:, Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops leaving as he and Patrick kneel down and beg], Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!
,Patrick:, ,[begging], Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?
,SpongeBob:, ,[begging], It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
,Patrick:, ,[begging], We didn't do it on purpose!
,Both:, ,[begging], Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!
,Patrick:, ,[begging], I don't want to be butt-less!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own. ,[wall is decorated with tiny ships], That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar... ,[runs over to a bunch of dolls lined up perfectly], ...rama! ,[Patrick and SpongeBob are confused], All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned! ,[straightens one of the dolls to an upright position],
,Doll:, Mama.
,Mr. Krabs:, And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go. ,[runs into a long pile of paintings], Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all. ,[takes the painting of a crying clown off], Or this one. ,[takes the painting of a car race off], Or this one. ,[takes the painting off. SpongeBob and Patrick are anxious], Or this one. ,[takes it off], Or this one. ,[takes it off], Or this one. ,[takes the painting of a banana off], Or this one. ,[takes Painty the Pirate off. SpongeBob is behind the painting he just took off],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you know, just hanging around.
,Patrick:, Boo!
,Mr. Krabs:, Get down onto the floor, boy. ,[SpongeBob stretches his body to the floor. Mr. Krabs is now annoyed], Alright, now you're just being silly.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Mr. Krabs takes him off the wall and throws him aside], No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[angrily], Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?!
,SpongeBob:, We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
,Patrick:, We're so sorry!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looks at the dollar again then looks at SpongeBob and Patrick], And then did you draw on it with crayon?! ,[dollar has a smiley face and two dollar signs drawn on with green crayon],
,Patrick:, ,[holding a green crayon as SpongeBob looks at him], I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it.
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, boys... you know what I've gotta do now?!
,SpongeBob:, You mean our butts?
,Patrick:, Can I use mine one last time? ,[Mr. Krabs takes the dollar and licks it. The paint comes off then Mr. Krabs puts the dollar back up on the wall],
,Mr. Krabs:, There we go, good as new.
,Both:, ,[They are shocked beyond belief. Stammering], But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[frowns then smiles], Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
,Mr. Krabs:, Nah, I just like to mess with ya! ,[Laughs. SpongeBob scowls. He and Patrick glare at Mr. Krabs; they storm out in disgust. Mr. Krabs laughs so hard he spits all over the walls], The old man's still got it! ,[continues laughing, but the paint comes off the wall from all the spit. He finally stops laughing to see his whole place a mess], Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.

"[The episode begins at Mr. Krabs' house. A boat drives up to the curb where a handsome narwhal named Dylan is dropping Pearl off.],
,Pearl:, Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan. ,[blinks her eyelids],
,Dylan:, No problem, Pearl. You still going for that party tonight? ,[waves his hair],
,Pearl:, ,[gasps], Oh-ho! You bet! ,[melts herself out of the boat],
,Dylan:, Nautical. ,[clicks his tongue], I'll pick ya up at eight. ,[drives away],
,[Pearl is incredibly head of heels with her new boyfriend. She sighs and gently floats to the door, leaving a trail of dust that forms the word, ""Swoon"". Pearl's floating crashes through the front door and floats over to Mr. Krabs. She stops floating when she wakes up from her daydreaming.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Again? Come on, Pearly-girl, we're running low on doors here! ,[picks out a door from the closet and pastes it to the front door],
,Pearl:, Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm just so excited about going to the big party tonight!  I—I—I just had to...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cuts Pearl off], Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Sorry, sweetie. ,[puts on his hat], Daddy's going out to play cards with the boys tonight. ,[his teeth is full of cards, his spits them out, and puts them in his sleeve],
,Pearl:, But, but Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, No buts! I can't be worrying about you all night, honey.
,Pearl:, ,[begins to tear up], But, Daddy, I just want to go to the party! ,[her eyes fill up with tears],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, shrimp.
,[Mr. Krabs takes cover and Pearl cries a huge fountain of tears.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa!
,[Pearl's tears destroyed everything it touched. The tears destroy a plant and a picture on the shelf. The tears destroy the picture of Grandpa Redbeard, a grandfather clock and Mr. Krabs' first dollar. The grandfather clock coo-coos three times. Mr. Krabs hiding under a footrest. But Pearl's tears destroy it. Mr. Krabs cowers himself from the tears.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whew. ,[his pants rip off], Hmm? ,[sees his butt showing], Ahh! ,[covers his ripped pants with tape], There, there, me little beluga. It'll be okay. I hired Mr. Squidward to babysit just like when you were little.
,[Pictures of Squidward babysitting Pearl are shown. The first one shows Squidward pushing baby Pearl in her cradle. The second one shows baby Pearl crying while flooding the house and Squidward swimming for his life. And the third one shows Squidward holding baby Pearl in his lap.],
,Pearl:, Ew, Dad! Squidward is so lame.
,Mr. Krabs:, Lame, schmame. You and Squidward will have so much fun. You won't want to go anywhere. But just in case. ,[pushes the button and barricades the doors and windows with prison bars], You won't be able to go anywhere! ,[cackles until he hears a knock at the door], Oh, just in time.
,[Squidward is knocking on the door with a confident smile. He looks at the door and wonders why it's barricaded. Just then, Mr. Krabs answers the door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! Thanks for keeping an eye on me little Pearl tonight.
,Squidward:, No problem.
,Mr. Krabs:, Remember our deal, Squidward. Keep Pearl out of trouble and I'll give you one shift a week without SpongeBob. But if anything happens to my little angel...
,[Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out from his pocket. SpongeBob laughs and makes crazy, but creepy faces at Squidward.],
,Squidward:, No! Please! Anything but that! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. ,[Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob back in his pocket], You can count on me.
,Mr. Krabs:, I knew I could. ,[gets into his boat and drives away],
,Squidward:, Whew!
,Pearl:, Oh, thanks for watching the house tonight, Squidward. I'll be back late. So, you know, don't wait up for ,[gets snagged by a fishing hook], me!
,Squidward:, ,[grunts as he struggles to reel Pearl back], Your dad said we have to stay in tonight! ,[grunts], But that doesn't mean we can't have ,[grunts], fun!
,[Pearl flops around like a fish and Squidward drags her back in the house. The scene changes to Squidward and Pearl sitting at a table together.],
,Squidward:, ,[digs through his backpack], Look. ,[takes out a whale-shaped doll], We can play with this setaceous Sally doll. ,[takes out crayons and a coloring book], Or we could color this princess coloring book. ,[holds up a tape cassette], Or we could sing along with—Ahh!
,[Squidward notices that Pearl is gone and sees the ripped up doll on the floor.],
,Squidward:, Uh, Sally!
,[Squidward goes to look for Pearl and sees the coloring book and crayons on the floor.],
,Squidward:, ,[picks up the book, looks in it, and screams], Outside the lines! ,[drops the book],
,[Squidward rushes upstairs and goes to Pearl's bedroom door.],
,Squidward:, ,[knocks on the door], Pearl? ,[peaks in], Hello? ,[goes in her room and sees Pearl ripped wall paper and posters as if she is secretly making piñatas], Hmm, hey, uh, Pearl. Um, whatcha' up to?
,Pearl:, Arts and crafts!
,Squidward:, Hey, I dabble in the arts myself. Maybe I can help.
,[Pearl turns one of her crafts around and reveals the words ""R.I.P Squidward"" with skull and cross bones.],
,Squidward:, ,[freaks out], Uh, never mind. Uh, you seem to have that under control. I'll just, um, be out here if you need me. Or not. Definitely not. ,[leaves Pearl's room and sits on a chair], That is one morbid teen.
,Pearl:, That outta keep him out of my hair.
,[Pearl hears a horn honking outside the house. She opens the curtains and sees Dylan parked outside waiting for her. Dylan picks his teeth with a toothpick and looks at his watch. Dylan honks the horn again.],
,Pearl:, It's go-time!
,[Pearl takes out her little mirror and takes a look from outside her room. She sees Squidward sound asleep near the door. She goes to put her craft-shaped head on the bed to fool Squidward. She lifts her Boys Who Cry poster, drills a hole through the wall with her tears and sneaks into the wall. She climbs down through the wall and comes out from below the house. She accidentally slams the house really hard and wakes up Squidward.],
,Squidward:, ,[screams], Oh. ,[gets up], What's happening? ,[opens her bedroom door], Pearl? Oh. You asleep? Aw, she must've tuckered herself out.
,[Squidward taps on the Pearl's head-shaped craft and it slides off the bed.],
,Squidward:, ,[screams], Oh, no! Maybe if we get it on ice, then can reattach it—,[backs into the wall where Pearl made the home to escape], Ahh!
,[Squidward falls through the wall of the house and landed near the bottom of the front door. He digs himself underneath and comes out of the ground with the craft on his head. He pokes his eyes and mouth through the craft when he sees Pearl about to drive away with Dylan.],
,Squidward:, Huh?
,Pearl:, Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan.
,Dylan:, No prob.
,[Dylan drives away with Pearl. Squidward breaks free from the ground and des the craft.],
,Squidward:, She's gone! Krabs is gonna kill me!
,[Squidward rushes to his recumbent bicycle. He pumps air in the back tire, puts on elbow pads and a helmet. He checks the tire and adds more air in it. He puts the air pump in the basket and hastily hops on the bike. He looks both ways and goes after Pearl. Meanwhile, Dylan is driving past a sign that says, ""surface"".],
,Pearl:, Um, that sign said ""surface."" Are you sure this is the way? ,[giggles],
,Dylan:, For sure, babe. We're going to a breach party.
,Pearl:, Oh, I've never been to one of those before. Sounds exciting.
,[Dylan hits the accelerator and quickly drives the boat up a high cliff.],
,Dylan:, Whoo!
,[Meanwhile, Squidward is riding his bike trying to look for Pearl.],
,Squidward:, Hmm. Mm-hmm. ,[stops and picks up some dirt], Hmm. Still warm. ,[sees the sign that says ""surface""], The surface, eh? That SpongeBob-free shift will be mine! ,[He starts to go up the high cliff, but only gets a few hundred yards before his legs start to buckle. He slips back down but he doesn't dare let his bike reach the bottom. Groaning, he keeps biking up that vertical stretch of road], SpongeBob-shift—,[grunts], mine!
,[At the breach party near the surface, the party goers are having a great time. Some are watching television, eating pizza and drinking soda. Pearl, Dylan and other teenagers are roasting marshmallows over a hydrothermal vent. Pearl munches on the marshmallow on Dylan's narwhal tooth.],
,Pearl:, Mmm! Oh-ho, Dylan.
,[Several teens are having a breaching contest by chugging down soda and jumping to the surface. One teen chugs down some of the soda.],
,Teens:, ,[chanting], Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
,[The teen stops chugging and a bigger teen shakes him up to have him breach the surface.],
,Teens:, ,[chanting], Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach!
,[The small teen floats to the surface and burps. Then he falls back down in the water.],
,Teens:, Whoo-hoo!
,[Pearl, Dylan and the other teens dance to the music on the radio. Moments later, Squidward makes it up the cliff and his completely exhausted.],
,Squidward:, Pearl!
,Teens:, ,[stop dancing and gasp], Huh? What?
,Squidward:, You have to come home right away! We can do whatever you want if we go back now! I'll even play us some jazz! ,[pulls out his clarinet], Kids love jazz!
,[Squidward attempts to play music on his clarinet, but his lousy music makes Pearl, Dylan, and the party goers cringe.],
,Squidward:, ♪Come on, Pearl. Let's go home. I can't be here all alone.  Let's get back, before we're dead. ,[one teen covers his face with his hood and another hides in the beach umbrella], Skiddle-bobba-doo-diddle-bop-bop, yeah!♪
,[Squidward's ""jazzy"" music creates agony to the teens.],
,Teen #1:, No! Jazz making me nerdier! ,[his face grows pimples, his arms grow smaller and his shirt changes from ""cool"" to ""school""],
,[One teen grows braces and his clothing turns into band clothes. Another teen's sunglasses becomes reading glasses. Pearl and Dylan cover their ears from Squidward's music.],
,Pearl:, Oh, this is so embarrassing!
,Dylan:, Forget him, Pearl. Let's breach.
,[Dylan leads Pearl away from Squidward and goes to the breaching competition of the party. One teen breaches upward over the surface and comes back down into the water.],
,Teens:, Yeah! ,[gives high-fives to each other], Yeah! Yes! Yeah!
,Pearl:, Uh, I don't know. Is it dangerous?
,Dylan:, Uh-uh, babe. It's nautical. ,[waves his hair],
,[Pearl gasps and giggles.],
,Squidward:, Pearl! What about yo-yos? Kids love yo-yos! ,[gets tangled up in the yo-yos],
,Pearl:, Okay, let's do it! One, two, three, ,[breaches up really high over the surface], yahoo! This is so coral! ,[falls and ends up beached on Bikini Atoll's shore; she gasps and flops around], Dylan, help! This isn't nautical!
,[The teens see Pearl's feet dangling at the surface.],
,Teen #2:, Oh, man! She's beached!
,Dylan:, We're gonna be in so much trouble!
,Teen #3:, Leave her! Let's cheese it!
,Teen #4:, Let's get out of here!
,[Dylan and the teens ditch Pearl and leave.],
,Pearl:, ,[continues to flop around], Oh, no!
,Squidward:, Pearl, are you alright?
,Pearl:, Oh, Squidward, I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.
,Squidward:, It's okay! Let's just get you outta' here.
,[Squidward grabs Pearl's feet and struggles to pull her back down. But he ends up pulling her shoes off and he goes flying backwards. He tries pulling her again, but ends up tearing his own arms off.],
,Squidward:, Okay, okay, just hold on a second![He darts off]
,Pearl:, Hold on? What are you—Ahh!
,[Squidward plugs her blowhole with the air pump. He pumps air through Pearl's blowhole, making her inflate like a balloon. Pearl floats up high in the air. Squidward pulls the air pump out of Pearl's blowhole.],
,Pearl:, Huh?
,[Pearl flies around all over the sky until she runs out of air. She falls back down into the water and lands gently into Squidward's bike. The party is completely trashed and all of the party goers including Dylan are gone.],
,Pearl:, ,[tears up and cries], I can't believe Dylan ditched me! My life is over!
,Squidward:, Oh, I don't think it's that bad.
,[Pearl violently cries a fountain of tears. The tears rip of some of the leave of Bikini Atolls palm trees, scaring several seagulls in the process. Squidward cowers himself in fear.],
,Squidward:, I'll, um, just get you home.
,[Squidward struggles to paddle his bike to bring Pearl home.],
,French Narrator:, Many, many minutes later...
,[Squidward manages to bring Pearl home after a really long and exhausting ride. The bike's tires break into pieces and Pearl gets off to go in the house.],
,Pearl:, ,[sighs], Guess I'll just wait for my dad to get home.
,Squidward:, You know, there is a way we can still have a little fun tonight.
,Pearl:, Really?
,[The scene changes to Pearl and Squidward running up to Dylan's house with a bag. Pearl rings the doorbell and she and Squidward hide behind Dylan's boat.],
,Dylan:, ,[answers the door], Like, hello?
,[Dylan sees the bag and picks it up. He goes to look in the bag. When suddenly, the bag explodes, revealing SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob laughs and makes the same crazy and creepy faces from before.

"[The Krusty Krab at night. The lights are still on],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, SpongeBob! It's quittin' time! ,[the lights turn off and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk out], I've got a card game tonight. ,[he locks the doors],
,SpongeBob:, Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs? ,[we see the Chum Bucket across the street, with its lights still on],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton. ,[SpongeBob gasps],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Gasps], Plankton?! ,[a thought bubble appears over SpongeBob's head with Plankton inside], But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy! ,[he picks up a Krabby Patty], He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years! ,[the Plankton in the thought bubble sees the Krabby Patty and goes to get it, but SpongeBob squishes him with a fly swatter],
,Plankton:, Ouch. ,[the thought bubble disappears],
,SpongeBob:, Why would you play cards with him?
,Mr. Krabs:, Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom! ,[cut to him and Plankton holding cards and a giant stack of money on the table], Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years! ,[Mr. Krabs puts his cards down on the table and rakes in his money with his claws. Back to the present, Mr. Krabs' eyes have turned to dollar signs], I never lose! ,[the two start laughing and walk off their separate ways. Cut to the morning where Mr. Krabs walks to work crying, and SpongeBob walks in laughing],
,SpongeBob:, Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one! ,[Mr. Krabs leans against the Krusty Krab doors], How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I lost.
,SpongeBob:, Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?
,Mr. Krabs:, I didn't lose any money. ,[he sheds away a tear], I lost...
,SpongeBob:, Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!
,Mr. Krabs:, I lost... ,[SpongeBob grabs him],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!
,Mr. Krabs:, I lost... ,[he points to SpongeBob], you!
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Mr. Krabs:, I bet your contract and I lost. ,[SpongeBob stares blankly, then laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties. ,[he begins to walk to the door, but Mr. Krabs' claw stops him.], ,[after continually walking and getting nowhere, he falls to the floor],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm afraid you don't work here anymore. ,[Squidward runs out the door to the two],
,Squidward:, Please tell me this isn't a joke.
,SpongeBob:, Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke. ,[Plankton walks over],
,Plankton:, As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking. ,[he points at SpongeBob], You work for ,me, now, SpongeBob. ,[he whips out a bucket with the initials ""CB"" on it], Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet. ,[he jumps onto SpongeBob's head, kicks off the Krusty Krew hat and puts the bucket on his head. SpongeBob screams and runs to Mr. Krabs while knocking Plankton and the bucket off his head],
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him! ,[he tugs at Krabs' shirt collar], I wanna work for ,you, here at the Krusty Krab! ,[he and Krabs start crying loudly and hug],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!
,Plankton:, ,[pretending to sound genuinely sad], What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship? ,[whips out a crowbar], ,I, would! ,[he jumps up and uses the crowbar to pry SpongeBob off Krabs. SpongeBob goes flying with Mr. Krabs' arms still clung to him],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! ,[he slams into a cage and Krabs' arms fly off him. Plankton walks over and shuts the door],
,Plankton:, This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em! ,[a propeller emerges from the cage], I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs! ,[the propeller spins and pilots SpongeBob into the Chum Bucket],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! ,[he cries], Can I have my arms back? ,[Plankton walks over and throws the arms on Krabs' head. Cut to the cage hovering over a spotlight and dropping SpongeBob into it],
,SpongeBob:, What is this place? ,[the lights turn on and screens with wires and gizmos start starting up. SpongeBob gasps. A giant boiler turns on. SpongeBob yelps. A light turns on and a calendar entitled ""Science!"" appears and the photo of the month is some nerd in front of a blackboard. SpongeBob screams. Plankton bursts open the doors],
,Plankton:, Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty! ,[he walks over to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...
,Plankton:, Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now ,[he jumps onto SpongeBob's knee], and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef! ,[we see a giant robot that bears a slight resemblance to SpongeBob], So get cooking. ,[he twangs SpongeBob's nose. Later, SpongeBob is in front of a weird looking grill. He picks up a spatula with a spring end. He puts his fingers to one of the holes in the grill and steam bursts from it. SpongeBob screams. He looks at a digital sign reading ""KITCHEN""],
,SpongeBob:, The sign says ""kitchen"", but my heart says ""jail"". ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say.♪
,SpongeBob:, ♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪And fries should be fries, either way.♪
,SpongeBob:, ♪But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.♪
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.♪
,Unison:, ♪This kitchen's not the same without you.♪
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪It's just a greasy spoon♪
,SpongeBob:, ♪It's just a greasy spoon...♪
,Unison:, ♪...without you.♪ ,[SpongeBob cries],
,Plankton:, What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.
,Karen:, You know that never works! The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want.
,Plankton:, Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.
,[We see SpongeBob struggling to make a Krabby Patty with one of Plankton's cooking machines],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Sound of surprise],
,Plankton:, Hi!
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!
,Plankton:, Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.
,SpongeBob:, Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.
,Plankton:, Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I usually cook on a grill.
,Plankton:, You got it! ,[Plankton brings a grill into the Chum Bucket], Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.
,Plankton:, Say no more, I'll take care of everything. ,[Plankton pushes the grill], How about here?
,SpongeBob:, A little more to the left.
,Plankton:, How's this, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Move it over a little more.
,Plankton:, Here?
,SpongeBob:, Keep going.
,Plankton:, Here?
,SpongeBob:, Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.
,Plankton:, ,[cut to a blindfolded SpongeBob], Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Okay, go ahead, take it off! ,[he removes the blindfold], It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!
,SpongeBob:, It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs! ,[his face turns sad. wailing], Oh...Mr. Krabs!
,Plankton:, Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?
,SpongeBob:, Well...there is one thing I've always wanted... ,[cut to SpongeBob with some fancy vibrating shoes on], Wow!
,Plankton:, So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
,SpongeBob:, Well... ,[cut to SpongeBob in a bubble bath, licking green mint ice cream],
,Plankton:, You ready to make some patties?
,SpongeBob:, Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream! ,[cut to SpongeBob riding a toy car, with Plankton pushing him],
,Plankton:, ,[while pushing him], How about those patties?
,SpongeBob:, Faster! Faster! Faster! ,[cut to Plankton reading to SpongeBob a baby book],
,Plankton:, And then the littlest sea-elf said... ,[drool drops on Plankton. SpongeBob is sleeping. He wakes up], Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?
,SpongeBob:, All this preparation is making me hungry.
,Plankton:, Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
,SpongeBob:, Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?
,SpongeBob:, ,[yawning], No, I don't really feel like it!
,Plankton:, But I don't understand. ,[SpongeBob drinks soda from a cup], You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair. ,[loses his cool as he exposes his hands with fumes rising out], I rubbed your putrid feet!
,SpongeBob:, Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!
,Plankton:, ,[growls in fury], I command you to make me a patty this instant!
,SpongeBob:, ,[crossing his arms in refusal], No!
,Plankton:, Don't back sass me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[mocking Plankton], Do ba da ma!
,Plankton:, What?! ,[SpongeBob blows a raspberry as he moons at him], That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges. ,[cut to Plankton outside of a lab], Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants... ,[to the audience], I put the brain in the robot, you know. ,[to Robot SpongeBob], You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want ,you, to make me a Krabby Patty!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Beeping], Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?
,Plankton:, ,[going mad], What? What?!
,SpongeBob:, Get welded.
,Plankton:, ,[pressing the button on the control], Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
,SpongeBob:,  ,[Robot SpongeBob reads a comic and drinks oil], I don't wanna.
,Plankton:, ,[screams out of madness],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cut to the Krusty Krab], Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter. ,[holds up an ""Out of Business"" sign], Huh?
,Plankton:, ,[crying], I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
,Mr. Krabs:, Um...Well... ,[taking off the ""Out of Business"" sign off the doors], a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.
,Plankton:, Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!
,Mr. Krabs:, How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.
,Plankton:, It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, be gone with you, you puny pest! ,[Mr. Krabs throws Plankton back inside the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, Thank you! ,[a crashing sound is heard], Ouch.
,SpongeBob:, My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Yawns], I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby? ,[laughs; Mr. Krabs glares at him], I mean...I'm working all day for free! My treat! ,[runs to the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's what I thought you said.

,Karen:, Whoops, sorry! I'm just so excited about our cruise, cruisey cruise cruise, ha ha ha! Cruise, cruise! ,[Plankton turns down Karen's vacation settings], Cruise, ha ha ha, cruise...
,Plankton:, Gotta rethink that vacation algorithm when we get back.
,[The next scene is on the huge luxury ocean cruise ship. A band is playing and fish are relaxing on deck],
,Plankton:, ,[Plankton and Karen are relaxing on deck], Nothing tops kicking back next to my loving computer wife and soaking up the rays.
,Karen:, Oh, I hope I don't get screen burn.
,Plankton:, Let me give you a hand with that, honey. ,[Plankton puts sunscreen on Karen's screen],
,Karen:, Oh, Plankton, you're such a sweet husband when you aren't obsessing over that stupid secret formula! ,[Plankton sees SpongeBob pushing Mr. Krabs along the deck in a mobile chair],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whee, ah ha ha!
,Plankton:, There he is, that swabby fool. Your turn now, Krabs.
,Karen:, Plankton, what are you denouncing now?
,Plankton:, Um, oh, the d'oeuvre guy, he's late with my nibbles again.
,Karen:, Oh, don't get all worked up, Plankton. Let's just focus on spending some quality time together alone for a change. ,[Plankton spots Mr. Krabs again],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, ha ha ha! Now push me back to the top, push me to the top!
,D'oeuvre Guy:, Would you like a nibble, sir?
,Plankton:, Is that Kelp Cheese? ,[Plankton grabs the cheese, but it's to heavy for him, so he falls with the cheese on his head. Karen takes a photo of him],
,Karen:, That snack is as big as you are! Ha ha ha ha!
,Plankton:, Very funny, Karen. Perhaps you should of married a pile of cheese. ,[He gets an idea], That's it!
,[Plankton shapes the cheese to look like him and sneaks away. He once again sees Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob:, Ha ha ha!
,Plankton:, ,[Trying to get up the stairs], Un! Eh! Un! Un! Eh!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah ha ha! Whee! Ha ha ha! Ar ar ar ar!
,Plankton:, ,[panting], AHHHH! ,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob run over Plankton.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you hear that? ,[Plankton moans and hides from them, leaving squash marks behind.], I could've sworn that I heard Plankteron!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, me too.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, well. One more time around the deck!
,[Plankton comes back to where he was relaxing before. He gets rid of the cheese],
,Plankton:, I'm so exhausted! How's it going, honey?
,Karen:, Zzzzz...yawn... hi, Plankton, I must of activated sleep mode. Oh, what a great idea this was getting away from your usual shenanigans.
,Plankton:, Yeah, heh heh, sure is. ,[He spots Mr. Krabs], Uh, just sit back while I massage your wheels. ,[He massages her wheels],
,Karen:, Now your making me so tired...zzzz....zzzz...
,Plankton:, Sleep well, babe, he he he he.
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are in the sauna. Plankton is in the water bowl and nearly gets scooped up by SpongeBob],
,Plankton:, Whew, that was close. ,[A fish scoops him up],
,Bubble Bust:, Boy, I'm so sweaty. ,[The fish pours the water down his back. Plankton slides down his back, fast approaching the fish's butt.],
,Plankton:, AGGHHHHH! ,[Plankton plunges into the fish's crack. He is now plastered against his butt in a very uncomfortable position.], I hate you, Krabs.
,[Now Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are playing shuffleboard on deck. Plankton is under one of the pucks],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wahoo!
,Plankton:, You're not getting away this time!
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm feeling lucky! ,[Mr. Krabs hits the puck that Plankton is under],
,Plankton:, AGGHHHH!
,[Mr. Krabs is now water-skiing behind the ship. SpongeBob and Plankton are watching him],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh yeah!
,SpongeBob:, Go Mr. Krabs!
,Plankton:, I don't care anymore! Formula or no formula, I'm taking you down! ,[Plankton takes out a knife to cut the rope attached to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ar ar ar ar!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Just then, the ship malfunctions and tips left and right], Whoa! Aahh!
,Plankton:, ,[Plankton then falls into the water], AAHHHHH! ,[Underwater, Plankton comes to close to the propellor and gets cut in half], Alright, alright! I give up! I know what I'm beat!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oo, what's all this? Free Land Food, sounds so exotic. ,[He picks up a piece of corn. he sniffs it], Huh, this looks promising. ,[He takes a bite, but immediately spits it out. It lands in SpongeBob's mouth], That tastes like putrefied coral stems dipped in rotten butter sauce.
,SpongeBob:, ,[with corn in his mouth], Yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, I don't know how anyone can stand this slop. It makes me miss our grub over back at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob, be a good man-servant and fix me up a Krabby Patty, would ya?
,SpongeBob:, A good fry cook is never far from his grill, sir. ,[SpongeBob takes out a suitcase that transforms a grill],
,Sadie Rechid :, What is that delicious smell?
,Fred Rechid :, I don't know, but I want it, whatever it is!
,SpongeBob:, Order up, Mr. Krabs!
,[Mr . Krabs is about to eat the Krabby Patty when suddenly tons of people line up to order a Krabby Patty],
,Mr. Krabs:, He he hey! Looks like we have a business venture on our hands. This vacation just got a whole lot more lookerin' if you know what I'm sayin'. Krabby Patties! Come and get your Krabby Patties!
,Plankton:, ,[dressed up as an old English folk], Ahem, good day sirs, I would like to pilfer your, I mean, purchase a Krabby Patty.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hm, watch me sucker this guy. That will be a mere one hundred dollars.
,Plankton:, That's all? Why certainly, he he he. ,[Plankton hands Mr. Krabs $100 and Mr. Krabs hands Plankton the Krabby Patty],
,Mr. Krabs and Plankton:, Ah he he he he...
,Mr. Krabs:, Come to daddy! ,[Mr. Krabs sniffs the $100 bill], Hey, wait a minute, there's chum all over this bill. Hey, buddy! Where did you get this?
,Plankton:, From the same place this is going, the Chum Bucket laboratory! Nice doing business, Krabs! he he he he! ,[Plankton gets away on a jet-pack],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nooooo!
,SpongeBob:, Stand back, sir. Leave this to your trusty man-servant. ,[SpongeBob starts to chase Plankton],
,Plankton:, Ah ha ha ha ha! ,[Plankton sprays smoke into SpongeBob's face], Choke on that, you big..omf! ,[Plankton hits Karen's screen. SpongeBob takes the Krabby Patty back],
,Karen:, I knew that you were up to something! I can't believe you'd try and fool me for your own selfish needs! My second honeymoon, ruined! ,[Karen cries],
,Plankton:, Well, technically it's your first.
,Karen:, Oh, would you can it already? I guess I have no choice, but to turn up the settings on my vacation set. ,[She turns up her own vacation settings],
,Plankton:, Bu...but I don't think that's such a good...,[Karen goes crazy once again and starts firing a laser beam through the middle of the ship. The ship splits in two and starts sinking as people start jumping over the edge and paddling away in lifeboats. As people row away in lifeboats, the captain of the ship is one of the many on the lifeboats],
,Cruise Ship Captain:, Oh, if I wasn't on parole!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[He and SpongeBob were looking over the edge of the ship], Me costumers! Aw, this vacation is a total bust!

,Lou:, Sorry, kid. We're all out.
,SpongeBob:, Aww, barnacles. ,[he hears crying coming from Plankton, who's sitting on a bench with two ice creams], Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?
,Plankton:, Oh, hi, SpongeBob. ,[blows his nose], I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one! ,[cries], I don't know what to do with the other one! ,[SpongeBob is confused; Plankton cries then stops for a second and looks at SpongeBob and cries again.],
,SpongeBob:, I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
,Plankton:, SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
,SpongeBob:, Sure! ,[starts to lick the ice cream],
,Plankton:, SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob is still licking the ice cream], SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob eats the whole ice cream and is now licking what's left inside. Plankton uses his megaphone to get SpongeBob's attention], SPONGEBOB!
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns towards Plankton], Yeah? ,[spits out ice cream as he talks],
,Plankton:, Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance. ,[SpongeBob licks his fingers], You can have anything you want with a little training. ,[SpongeBob licks his fingers again],
,SpongeBob:, Training?
,Plankton:, Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
,SpongeBob:, Assertive, huh?
,Plankton:, That's right.
,SpongeBob:, Anything I want. ,[licks his lips], Sounds great! ,[spits more ice cream at Plankton when talking],
,Plankton:, Wonderful. ,[laughs evilly then SpongeBob joins in the laughing. Then an adult fish sits on SpongeBob], SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
,SpongeBob:, Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.
,Plankton:, No, no, be assertive! ,[SpongeBob puts his fingers in the guy's pockets],
,SpongeBob:, Beep Beep! ,[Plankton facepalms],
,Plankton:, Not in-sertive! ,[adult fish checks his watch, then walks away], SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!
,SpongeBob:, But I'm a spo...
,Plankton:, Don't say it! ,[Plankton spots the eel that took SpongeBob's ice cream], There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?
,SpongeBob:, Ice cream! ,[Plankton gets up and runs behind Electric Eel],
,Plankton:, Listen, you! My friend's got something to say! ,[Electric Eel turns around],
,Eel:, What, who said that? ,[talks to SpongeBob], Was it you?
,Plankton:, Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
,SpongeBob:, That's my ice cream cone!
,Plankton:, Great! Now let him have it!
,SpongeBob:, ,[misunderstanding what Plankton means], You can have it.
,Eel:, Say, thanks! ,[walks off],
,Plankton:, No! ,[jumps inside SpongeBob's mouth], I'll show ya how! ,[voicing for SpongeBob, SpongeBob stands still.], Hey, pencil neck! ,[Electric Eel turns around], Yeah, you. Slither over here! ,[Electric Eel walks over to SpongeBob], Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery! ,[Electric Eel looks scared; he throws the ice cream onto SpongeBob's face and runs away crying],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that guy was crying!
,Plankton:, Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah!
,Plankton:, You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.
,Plankton:, Whatever.
,SpongeBob:, Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it! ,[throws ice cream on  his tongue, hitting Plankton who is still on it. Later, he is using a metal detector, and it beeps], I found something!
,Scooter Like Fish:, Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours? ,[SpongeBob hands the equipment to him],
,SpongeBob:, Sure!
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
,SpongeBob:, ,[misunderstands], Do you want to take a hike with me?
,Scooter Like Fish:, Yeah.
,Plankton:, ,[angry], Now, look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sees a ditch], Hey, go check in that ditch! ,[points to the ditch beside them. The fish jumps down in the ditch and finds a treasure chest],
,Scooter Like Fish:, Wow, buried treasure! Thanks!
,SpongeBob:, Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!
,SpongeBob:, Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!
,Fish:, But I'm wearing sandals!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, never mind! ,[Plankton jumps off of SpongeBob], It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?
,Plankton:, ,[putting things into a suitcase], Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. ,[puts on a black hat], I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
,SpongeBob:, No it's not!
,Plankton:, Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
,SpongeBob:, But what about airline food?
,Plankton:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night! ,[rimshot], See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? ,[Plankton throws his hat down],
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!
,Plankton:, Okay, but this is your last chance! ,[points to people trying to get a tan], Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
,SpongeBob:, Just watch me! ,[runs over and waves a blanket up and down and builds up sand to make the beach-goers run away], Man, this thing is sandy!
,Fred:, My leg! ,[after everyone runs off, SpongeBob is laying on his back with a funnel acting as a sunlamp],
,Plankton:, Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach! ,[SpongeBob now has a tan and looks brown], SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
,SpongeBob:, Well, not all of me.
,Hot Dog Man:, Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
,Plankton:, Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
,SpongeBob:, I'll do better than that! ,[he stretches his tongue to eat everybody's hotdogs],
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Plankton:, Breaking your wind! ,[SpongeBob uses one of his teeth to boomerang it into cutting the strings off the kites],
,Larry:, Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball. ,[SpongeBob pops the volleyball and trumpets like an elephant. Everybody leaves the beach],

,Plankton:, Exactly.
,SpongeBob:, You didn't tell me everyone would leave.
,Plankton:, Oops. ,[he presses a button in his crane, and the ""Mega Bucket"" sign comes out from the ground],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development! ,[voice cracks], That wasn't nice!

,SpongeBob:, Well, what about aggressively nice people?
,Plankton:, Huh? What are you doing? ,[SpongeBob brings out the hot dogs he ate earlier and puts them back where they belong. Then he puts the kites back where they were], Wait, SpongeBob! Stop! ,[a girl is crying because she has sand on her ice cream. SpongeBob takes it and wipes the sand off with his eyelashes], Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting! ,[Scooter is crying at his broken surfboard],

,Scooter:, Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.
,Plankton:, Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting! ,[bunches up into a ball], Need hatred. ,[crawls away],

,Narrator:, Ah, dawn breaks over the primordial sea. ,[We submerge into the prehistoric Pacific ocean to see a muddy swamp], It's here that millions of years ago, life began taking its first clumsy steps out of the darkness, opening its newly- formed eyeballs to stare into the blinding light of intelligence, in order to- Umm... never mind.

,[We pan over to prehistoric Conch street, where three houses similar to SpongeBob's pineapple, Patrick's rock, and Squidward's Easter Island Head, except SpongeBob's house has a fern growing out of the top, Squidward's is more like a monkey-shaped head, and Patrick's has no bamboo weathervane. These are prehistoric homes to the three's cavemen ancestors. In caveman SpongeBob's house, it is one large, empty room with cave drawings of him jellyfishing on the walls and rocks and bones on a shelf above his blanket, which he sleeps under. Back outside, a giant purple dinosaur fish wakes up under a beam of sunlight to gurgle out a call similar to SpongeBob's foghorn alarm clock. The sound waves cause the rock to rattle off a shelf and it falls on the prehistoric sponge's head. Alarmed, SpongeGar shrieks, but calms down when he notices the rock. He laughs and shoves the rock back on the shelf. He then takes his hide blanket from on the floor and puts it on as a pair of caveman pants. He puts one arm through a sleeve and walks outside of his pineapple, dragging a vine behind him],

,[He is about to run outside, but stops],
,Squog:, ,[speaking complete English], Wait a minute...
,[He imagines himself babbling in anger at Gary, and Gary smashing him. Giant Gary smashes him again. Squog tries to get up, but Gary smashes him repeatedly. He hops onto Squog, and slithers off, leaving nothing but a slime trail.],
,Squog:, Hmm...
,[He runs over and picks up two clubs. He debates with himself over which one to use. He takes the bigger one and walks out chuckling deviously. The club left behind cries. Squog approaches SpongeGar and Gary, who are out in the clearing],
,Squog:, SpongeGar! SpongeGar! Manaka! ,[Dino Gary rolls his eyes and slithers away], No tabonga Gary pooga! ,[Squog displays a small pile of snail slime and points to his front walkway, covered in the snail goop], Tabonga as a go o saila! Tabonga doo!. Tabonga doo!
,SpongeGar:, Tabonga doo? Hmm... Tabonga doo...
,[Squog fumes and stamps off, but slips on the snail slime, sliding as if on a ""Slip 'n' Slide"", screaming for SpongeGar's help. But SpongeGar is too busy pondering the meaning of Squog's demand. Squog slams into caveman Patrick's rock, which opens, revealing Patrick's ancestor sticking to the underside of it as Patrick often does],
,Patar:, Patar!
,[He walks over to Squog, who is covered in snail slime, but not sliding any longer],
,Patar:, Hmm... Yuck! ,[He sniffs his slime coating], Bleh! ,[He tastes some of the slime cautiously], Blecch! ,[He then takes out a salt shaker and adds some salt to the slime and tastes it again. This time it appears to be somewhat palatable, and he is satisfied, giving a thumbs up], Mowonga!
,[Squog, gets angry and shakes the slime off himself],
,Squog:, Patar! Grrr...
,Patar:, Squog! ,[He laughs and hugs him], Patar unga Squog! ,[He squeezes him so tightly, that the veins in his arms pop out, and Squog is slightly strangled],Squog!

,[Patar sees him and lets go of Squog, and Squog passes out onto the ground. The two run up to each other],
,Patar:, SpongeGar! ,[SpongeGar smiles and hits himself on the head. Patar smiles and punches himself in the face a couple times. SpongeGar pulls out his nose and lets it go, slamming it back into his face. He screams, then his nose pops out. He stops suddenly and smiles. Patar pulls his lower lip over his head, and it tears off. He screams, then smiles], SpongeGar!
,SpongeGar:, Patar.
,[Patar and SpongeGar hug],
,Squog:, Pfffffttt! SpongeGar and Patar no ga malonka palinka. Heh, heh. Palinka... ,[He is about to walk home again, when he slips on the slime trail again, and slides for a moment longer before sliding into his clay monkey head house and crashing into the back wall, where cave paintings of hunters with arrows point at his exposed rear], Wima soe... ,[Back in the sand field across from the row of homes, SpongeGar reaches into his pants and pulls out half of a coconut shell with juice inside. He howls in glee. Patar sniffs it. SpongeGar gets a log and pours the liquid into it and blows into a hollow branch sticking out of the top of it, producing a bubble in a hole on the other side of the log. Patar tries to take cover from the bubble, but then sees it pop and realizes it's harmless and that there is no need to protect himself from it. So he claps and howls in delight. Then, clouds appear and it begins to rain. Patar then claps again and the rain stops, and the clouds relocate themselves. Patar smiles. SpongeGar tries his hand at it, but the rain stall. A few moments later, the clouds re-appear and it rains. Both cheer. Patar claps, and the rain ceases once more. The two get excited, and clap excessively. The rain begins, but won't stop. Next, thunder sounds, and the two stop their howling. Patar claps again, and lightning flashes, making the two panic. Squog watches them from the second story window in his house], Patar and SpongeGar bawannagog. No pooca Squog. Squog tay taila foo.
,[Squog starts to do art with a chisel when thunder sounds. Lightning strikes the log. Squog looks out his window and gasps to see that the bubble-blowing log has been ignited in flames, and Patar and SpongeGar have been injured by the lightning],
,Squog:, Patar! SpongeGar!
,[Both get up and run behind a rock, startled. They peek out from behind it to see the fire. SpongeGar, Squog, and Patar slowly approach it, quaking. Squog sniffs it and sticks his hand into it. His hand burns and he takes it out and sucks his hand. SpongeGar and Patar put their hands in],
,Both:, Huh? Hmmm... Uh-huh, Uh-huh... Ahhh...
,[Sigh in relief. Then, suddenly, both scream in complete pain. Then, Patar sniffs his, and turns away from it. Then, he adds salt and gnaws on his hand, growls at SpongeGar and crawls away, thinking that SpongeGar and Squog will eat it. Patar continues gnawing his hand and growls at them once more like a bulldog. They don't want it, but they do get hungry. SpongeGar sees two plants],
,SpongeGar:, Fongar!
,[As he runs over to get them, Squog calls him a protozoa],
,Squog:, Monga.
,[SpongeGar is walking back when he trips and the plants fly into the fire],
,Squog:, SpongeGar!
,[He angrily speaks gibberish. When he's done, he turns to see that Patar is salting his burnt hand. When Patar goes to bite Squog's hand, Squog smashes his head in with a stick],
,Squog:, Patar! Chonga!
,[Patar crawls away disappointedly. SpongeGar stares at Squog's stick, the two plants in the fire, then the stick again, then the plants, back and forth. We hear mystical music as he looks at the two faster and faster. Then, we see the live-action singers in barbershop garb with gray mustaches. Suddenly, SpongeGar gets an idea],
,SpongeGar:, Aha! Squog! Squog! ,[Motions towards the stick], Tooka SpongeGar? Hmm? ,[Squog nods happily and hits SpongeGar on the head with the stick], Nah! Nah! Nah! ,[takes Squog's stick],
,[He slowly impales one of the plants with the stick. He sniffs it and then eats it. He then begins jumping up and down in delight, hooting. Apparently, it tasted good. Squog watches him. Then, SpongeGar offers the other plant to Squog, who hesitantly takes it and eats it.],
,Squog:, Yumma
,[Squog ends up liking it, and hoots and jumps up and down as SpongeGar watches. He and SpongeGar then shake hands.],
,Squog:, Taila foo, SpongeGar! Taila foo! SpongeGar na dumbo.
,[A speech balloon appears from Squog's mouth with Albert Einstein in it. Later, SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog have a cookout. SpongeGar sticks a marshmallow-like plant through the stick, and roasts it in the fire and eats it. Squog does the same with a piece of green coral. Patar toasts a stick and eats it, puncturing his lips],
,SpongeGar:, Patar! Mm-mm. Wa SpongeGar!
,[Mr. Krabs' ancestor scuttles by],
,Prehistoric Krabs:, Money! Money! Ooga booga! Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Ooga boo...Agh! ,[SpongeGar steps on him, takes Patar's stick, and impales him.],
,Patar:, ,[Takes the stick, puts it in the fire, and then eats it. He burps. The three jump up and down hooting and hollering. The scene freezes.],
,Narrator:, Hooray! It looks like our prehistoric pals have just discovered fire, but they will soon learn that when you play with fire, you may get burned. Stay tuned. ,[cut back to Patchy, who is laughing hysterically],
,Patchy:, I told you prehistoric times were fun! Hey! How's about I teach you kids how a caveman makes a fire with ,[holds up two sticks], two sticks? ,[he rubs them together], Yeah… Doesn't get any cooler than that, huh? Chalk one up for Patchy! ,[an 'I' is chalked up on the wall below a sign reading 'Prehistory'], Rubbing… ,[he pants. Nothing is happening, and he eventually gives up], I guess this is a type of wood that doesn't burn. ,[a laser shoots through and lights the two sticks on fire, startling Patchy], Potty! ,[we see Potty with firing lasers using a laser cannon on his back],
,Potty:, ,[squawks], Laser technology. Score one for the future. ,[cut to the digital screen next to the prehistory chalk labeled 'The Future.' The score goes from '00' to '01'],
,Patchy:, Well, I have something that you'll never find in your little ,[air quotes], future: a real live caveman. Hmm… ,[the caveman walks in from behind], Hey, there he is! Come on in, little troglodyte fella. Come on… ,[the caveman is very slowly approaching], You see, kids, I found him frozen in a block of ice and then I spent three days thawing him out with my mom's hair dryer. I call him Cavey. ,[the caveman approaches the camera, and recoils in horror. Patchy chuckles], Isn't he something? It's okay, Cavey. ,[another 'I' is chalked up for 'Prehistory'],
,Potty:, That's nothing, old timer. Make way for the future. ,[a door swings up and a robot enters the room],
,Robot:, Greetings. I am the X-29488. How may I serve you? ,['The Future' score goes from '01' to '02'],
,Patchy:, Where do you keep getting all this stuff?
,Potty:, Never you mind, pops. Let's go see what Cavey thinks. ,[squawks. Cavey slowly approaches the robot, and touches it. The robot's eyes start flashing red. A siren goes off],
,Robot:, Attack! Attack! ,[Cavey starts to run off and the robot gives slow chase, shooting lasers at him. For every shot, 'The Future' score keeps going up from '02' to '06'],
,Patchy:, Potty! You're ruining me caveman show!
,Robot:, Attack! Attack! ,[the robot continues to shoot lasers. Cut to the exterior, which is rumbling],
,Narrator:, Will Patchy ever get control of the special? ,[cut to SpongeGar, mesmerized by the fire], What will SpongeBob do with fire? ,[cut to the SpongeBob B.C. screen], Stay tuned to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. and find out! ,[fade on a black screen. Cut back to Patchy's cave house, the house still rumbling],
,Narrator:, Welcome back to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. Sounds like things have gone from bad to worse for Patchy. Let's watch. ,[inside, the robot is still firing lasers, and Cavey throws a giant rock at him. Patchy is huddled behind the couch. Potty watches with a soda and popcorn],
,Potty:, ,[squawk], This is great.
,Patchy:, Ahoy, glad you're back. ,[ducks a laser], Let's watch the rest of SpongeBob B.C. while I get things straightened out around here. Whoa! ,[he ducks as a giant rock falls on him. He comes up dazed], Or… maybe not. ,[he collapses. Cut back to the freeze frame of SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog],
,Narrator:, When we last saw our hungry troglodytes, they just discovered fire. How long will it take for them to mess it up? Let's see. ,[scene continues as SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog continue to jump up and down hooting. They all run off. SpongeGar impales some long grass, toasts them, and eats them. Squog impales some primitive flowers and leaves, toasts them, and takes a bite out of them. Patar impales his loincloth, toasts that, and eats it. He burps up a charred piece and wipes his mouth with it, and then eats it. The three continue to find things to eat. SpongeGar twirls up some vines on the stick, toasts it, and slurps it up. Squog puts some rocks in a pan, toasts it, and it becomes popcorn. He eats some. Patar lifts up a rock, and a bunch of Prehistoric Krabs, who are simultaneously saying, ""money,"" crawl out. Patar drools. SpongeGar draws a circle in the sand, impales it, and lifts it, revealing a sand Krabby Patty. He toasts it. Cut to the three chewing vigorously. They all continue to eat, and they belch.],
,Squog:, Bolapa. ,[SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog continue to run off, get something, toast it, and eat it. Over and over and over and over and over and over again, until eventually, they are on the ground, their stomachs extremely full, satisfied. They yawn and get up],
,Squog:, Ganoga, Patar. Ganoga, SpongeGar.
,Patar:, Ganoga, Squog. Ganoga, SpongeGar.
,SpongeGar:, Ganoga, Squog. Ganoga, Patar.
,[The three walk back to their houses, but then halt. The three turn and look at the fire. Squog runs over and picks up the fire],
,SpongeGar:, No Squog fwee fwee! SpongeGar fwee fwee!
,Squog:, SpongeGar fagonda!
,[SpongeGar shoves Squog. Squog is shocked and sets the log down and shoves him back for revenge. SpongeGar shoves Squog again. Squog whacks him with his club, so Sponge rubs his head. SpongeGar hits Squog with his own club, so Squog rubs his head. The two continue to whack each other with clubs, while Patar retrieves the fire. SpongeGar and Squog stop whacking each other and they look at Patar. Patar hoots excitedly as he runs back to his rock. Patar looks behind him to see if Squog and SpongeGar have caught up, and turns to see two of them in front of him], 
,Both:, Patar!
,[Patar screams, throwing the log into the air, where it stays. Squog is about to catch it when SpongeGar jumps on Squog's head and takes it instead],
,Squog:, Grrr... ,[SpongeGar runs off with it, but Patar takes it, then Squog, then SpongeGar takes Squog by mistake and chuckles nervously when Squog glares at him. Patar takes the log. Squog takes the log while vine swinging, but he hits a tree. The log rolls to the ground and it is then taken by SpongeGar who runs off. Squog's body slides to the ground. SpongeGar falls into trap Patar made and Patar grabs it instead. He then is scared off by a picture of a monster held up by Squog], Dumbo Patar. Fwee fwee Squog! ,[He picks up the log, runs back to his house, but it's locked so he searches for the key in his pocket. He gets it], Aha. ,[notices that the log is gone], Huh?! Grrr...
,[He sees SpongeGar running away with it, but he falls victim of another one Patar’s trap and drops the log. Patar grabs it and runs off happily],
,SpongeGar:, Patar! ,[Patar is upside-down], Bawana, Patar! Bawana. ,[the vine snaps, and SpongeGar thuds to the ground], Aah! Oof!
,Patar:, Patar fwee fwee!
,[Squog extends his four tentacles to trip Patar, and the log flies off. Squog chuckles and runs after the log as it rolls away. Patar joins Squog, all chasing the log again],
,Squog:, Fwee fwee Squog! Fwee fwee Squog!
,Patar:, Patar fwee fwee!
,SpongeGar:, SpongeGar fwee fwee!
,[The three chase it up a cliff, but it rolls back down and the log chases them],
,All:, Fwee fwee go bonga!
,[They trip on a vine and the log rolls past them. They stand up and the chase is again reversed as the three follow the log. When it stops rolling, they all tug on it],
,SpongeGar:, SpongeGar fwee fwee!
,Squog:, Squog fwee fwee!
,Patar:, Patar fwee fwee!
,[The fire is suddenly extinguished by more rain. They all sit],
,SpongeGar:, Oh, Patar...
,Patar:, Oh, SpongeGar...
,[SpongeGar and Patar cry],
,SpongeGar:, Oh, Patar...
,Patar:, Oh, SpongeGar... ,[they hug and cry],
,Squog:, ,[mumbles angrily], Sutaka jakasa! ,[He pulls out his club, but is struck by lightning. He collapses the ground, charred], ...Tabonga do.
,[SpongeGar and Patar roast marshmallows over Squog's blackened body],
,Narrator:, Perhaps certain events in history are better left untold. ,[cut back to Patchy, depressed sitting on his front step of his prehistoric house],
,Patchy:, Now I know how Squidward feels… ,[Potty comes in],
,Potty:, ,[squawk], Why the long face?
,Patchy:, I think you know perfectly well, you little winged vermin. All I wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were. But all they got was technology-induced chaos!
,Potty:, Come back inside. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
,Patchy:, You got rid of the robot android cyborg?!
,Potty:, Nope, even better. ,[the two walk inside],
,Patchy:, Potty, I guess I really misjudged you… ,[he looks], What the-?! ,[Cavey is at a drum set, and the robot is DJ-ing, as strobe lights go off],
,Song:, ""When Worlds Collide""
,When worlds collide
,Potty:, ,[Patchy is still shocked], Pretty sweet, eh? Brawk.
,You can run
,But no can hide
,When worlds collide
,You'll laugh so hard
,You'll swear you've died
,When worlds collide
,Hold my hand
,I'll be your guide
,When worlds collide
,Buckle...buckle...buckle up for the sweetest ride
,And prepare to have your mind blown wide
,When worlds collide
,Potty:, Yo, check it out!
,When worlds collide, it's a curious thing
,Bet you never heard a robot and a caveman sing
,In his metal chest are some working parts
,How is that different from my beating heart?
,I'm from the future, and I'm from the past
,But that don't mean this friendship wasn't built to last
,He was made in a lab, and I was born in a cave
,So let me hear you holler for this inter-era rave
,Squidward:, ,[Scene from ,SB-129,], Future!
,Potty:, Word!
,SpongeTron:, ,[Another scene from ,SB-129,], I am SpongeTron.
,You, you, you, you can run
,But you can't hide
,When worlds collide ,[Patchy shuts his mouth with his hook. The lighting returns to normal],
,Patchy:, Well, Potty, I guess you were right. The future is cool.
,Potty:, Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I got you a present from the prehistoric times.
,Patchy:, Ooh! What is it? A new loincloth?
,Potty:, No.
,Patchy:, An enlarged forehead?
,Potty:, No. ,[Potty flies off],
,Patchy:, Aww, what is it? ,[Potty opens the door, revealing a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which roars at Patchy. Patchy screams, his eyes bugging out, then he runs off with the Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing him], Potty! ,[he continues screaming as he runs off. Potty watches from the window, with popcorn and a soda],
,Potty:, ,[squawk], This is great. ,[the dinosaur grabs Patchy, who screams. Patchy is on his side, his feet inside the Tyrannosaurus Rex's jaws],
,Patchy:, Well, thanks for watching SpongeBob B.C., kids. ,[waves], Bye! ,[he continues screaming, then laughing. The Tyrannosaurus Rex tickles Patchy with his teeth], Now he's tickling! ,[he laughs], Cut it out, you rascal! ,[he continues laughing],

"[at the Barg'N-Mart, SpongeBob is whistling while putting a box of Kelp cereal in his shopping cart],
,SpongeBob:, What's this? ,[reads box label], It says a free prize! ,[braying laughter. Takes Gary and his box of cereal home and immediately dumps out all the cereal in the bowl and munches it all down], Huh? Where's my prize? ,[reads cereal box again], ""Free Prize."" ,[gasps], ""Offer inside""! Just send in 99 box tops! ,[cuts to SpongeBob eating more cereal with a bunch of cereal boxes all around him], How you doing over there, Gary?
,Gary:, Meow. ,[SpongeBob opens up a box and pours the cereal in Gary's bowl], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Send in the box tops... ,[swallows the cereal in his mouth], ...before eating all the cereal?!? ,[pause], Gary, you are a genius! ,[cuts to SpongeBob stuffing the envelopes with box tops.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Cuts to SpongeBob outside by the mailbox], I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

,SpongeBob and Patrick:, We're waiting. We're waiting.
,SpongeBob:, We're waiting.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, what are we waiting for?
,SpongeBob:, We're waiting for the mailman. He's bringing me a free toy.

,SpongeBob:, Why, sure.
,Both:, We're waiting. We're waiting. We're waiting.
,Patrick:, There's the mailman!
,Mailfish:, Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
,SpongeBob:, Yup. ,[shudders with excitement as the mailman hands him 3 envelopes and SpongeBob throws them away], Isn't there anything else?
,Mailfish:, Nope, sorry kid. ,[walks off whistling],
,SpongeBob:, Guess we'll have to keep waiting. ,[both wait by the mailbox. After a while, both of their stomachs growl and bark at each other],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, I'm hungry.
,SpongeBob:, Me, too.
,Patrick:, Let's go down to the Krusty Krab for a Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, Great idea, Patrick. Krusty Krab, here we... wait a minute. What if the mailman comes when I'm gone? ,[clings onto the mailbox],
,Patrick:, What's wrong SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, If I leave, the mailman might come and I might miss him.
,Patrick:, Oh, I'm gonna take off then. I don't think my arm can stand much more of this. ,[Patrick's stomach is biting his arm],

,Sandy:, Hiya! Hey, SpongeBob, want to do some karaaaaaa...! ,[SpongeBob grabs her arm and flips her on her back],
,SpongeBob:, Not now, I'm busy. ,[Sandy, looking pretty upset, brushes herself off and walks away. SpongeBob checks the mailbox again. Gary pushes his bowl by SpongeBob's foot], Oh, Gary, not now. Can't you see that I'm waiting for the mailman?! Doesn't anyone understand this?!? ,[checks the mailbox again then pants as a scared Gary takes his bowl away], So tired. ,[stomach growls], So hungry. ,[tries to perk up], But... must wait... for toy.

,SpongeBob:, My birthday cake.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Let me just get you a fork so you can eat it. ,[SpongeBob giggles], Uh, let me just hold the cake like this, ,[holds the piece of cake between his teeth], so I can get you a fork. ,[digs in pocket], Huh, I wonder where I put that fork. ,[notices he ate the cake], Oops.
,SpongeBob:, ,[disappointed], That was my cake. ,[sniffs back tears], What is the present?

"SpongeBob:, ,[opens his house door with a bunch of hearts in his arms], Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom! ,[throws hearts everywhere. He hands one to Squidward, but he rudely tears it up.

,Sandy:, ,[floating toward the carnival in the balloon], I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?
,SpongeBob:, Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
,Sandy:, ,[chuckles], You are such a kidder. Sandy out. That SpongeBob... ,[a group of orange flying oysters are heading toward the balloon], Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!

,Patrick:, ,[giggles], Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'. ,[runs up the mountain and falls off then runs back to SpongeBob], It wasn't there either!
,SpongeBob:, Are you sure? ,[runs up mountain and falls off again; SpongeBob uses his walkie-talkie to tell Sandy something], SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now. ,[Sandy is using a whip to shoo the scallops away],
,Sandy:, Uhh, SpongeBob, we got ourselves a little problem. I got a pack of chocolate-eating scallops trying to rustle the balloon! Hi-yah! Get away, you sweet-toothed varmints! Hi-yah! I'm going to be a little late!

,Patrick:, What's that?
,SpongeBob:, It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
,Patrick:, A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake?
,SpongeBob:, A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day! ,[Patrick shakes his hand and stares it and makes a grumpy looking face. SpongeBob laughs and throughout their playtime in the carnival, Patrick has the same grumpy look on his face. Later, the scene cuts to them sitting in the bench.],

,Fran:, Hey, SpongeBob, I just wanted to thank you for this box of chocolates.

,SpongeBob:, Are you kidding? ,[SpongeBob put his one thumbs-up on Sandy's helmet.],
,SpongeBob:, The thumbs-up is an iconic, internationally-recognized sign of positivity and affirmation. Boop!

,SpongeBob:, How's it looking, Dr. Manfish?
,Dr. Manfish:, Well, I'm afraid it doesn't look good, SpongeBob. It seems you've severely damaged your ulnar collateral ligament, possible from some kind of repeated action.
,SpongeBob:, An action like a thumbs-up?
,Dr. Manfish:, Certainly that is one possibility. Hitchhiking could be another.
,SpongeBob:, But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?
,Dr. Manfish:, ,[Dr. Manfish takes both his eye lenses off.], SpongeBob, I can't say that for certain. I'm only a board certified thumbologist. I don't know everything.

,Squidward:, Okay, fine, I'll just take your old pineapple. Huh? ,[suddenly notices Patrick eating SpongeBob's old house],
,Patrick:, Sorry, Squidward, but this is my house now. ,[eats a chunk of SpongeBob's old house],
,Squidward:, Well, then, where am I supposed to live?
,[The scene changes to Squidward living in Patrick's rock at night.],
,SpongeBob:, Night, Squidward.
,Squidward:, ,[grumbles and sneezes as he gets squished by the rock], Ow.

"Mr. Krabs:, ,[scene starts at Krusty Krab], ,[to Nat], And how is everything for you today, sir?
,Nat:, Oh, it's great! Just great!
,Mr. Krabs:, Fine, fine.
,Nat:, I just love this Krabby Patty!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, okay, always nice to hear. ,[starts walking away],
,Nat:, My Krabby Patty is a Krabby Patty and both buns are also Krabby Patties! ,[Krabs suddenly stops walking, eyes widen], So luxurious!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs back, takes the patty from Nat, and looks at it as his pupil turn into dollar signs], You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that!
,Nat:, No extra. It's the same low price as a regular Krabby Patty.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pupil dollar signs rip], Argh! ,[faints. Squidward sprinkles salt on him and he screams], Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?! ,[Squidward sprinkles more salt on him and he screams again],
,Squidward:, I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt.
,Fred:, Hey, my Krabby Patty is just a bun! And the two buns... are also buns. Stale buns.
,Tom:, ,[teary-eyed], My patty tastes like sadness.
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors... ,[gets up, grunting], ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?!
,Squidward:, What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offense.
,Squidward:, None taken.
,Mr. Krabs:, Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it. ,[walks to the kitchen],
,Squidward:, Let me grab a pencil. ,[to himself], Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha.
,[there are patties, covered in condiments, smushed in the window. SpongeBob is sobbing, lying on the floor],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[enters], Avast there, lad! ,[steps on SpongeBob's foot, causing him to stand up], You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief.
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. ,[sniffles], Oh, I can't even cry right! ,[sobs],
,Mr. Krabs:, There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I've been in driving school as long as I can remember, and I still don't have my license!
,Mr. Krabs:, How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops crying], Oh, about $100 a semester.
,Mr. Krabs:, $100 a semester?! ,[pupils again turn into dollar signs], Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time!
,SpongeBob:, ,[happily], Really?
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel.
,[Pearl drives through the kitchen, moving the grill and the vat of grease from its spot, all while putting on makeup],
,Pearl:, Hi, Daddy! I need money for shoes.
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl. ,[gives Pearl money from his wallet],
,Pearl:, Thanks, Daddy! ,[drives out of the kitchen, leaving a hole in the other wall],
,[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs in a driving boat],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, are you sure about this, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a... ,[air quotes], ""professional"" to teach you how to drive.
,SpongeBob:, You know, Mr. Krabs, at boating school, Mrs. Puff...
,Mr. Krabs:, Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps in shock], It is?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[points to SpongeBob], And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gives a thumbs-up], Okay! ,[starts the boat, but then accidentally reverses it, destroying the Krusty Krab sign],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[nervously chuckles], Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time.
,SpongeBob:, It does?
,Mr. Krabs:, No, but you got the right fire in your belly.
,SpongeBob:, I do?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles], Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue.
,[bubble transition to the Mr. Krabs driving the boat in an empty parking lot],
,Mr. Krabs:, This empty parking lot is just the ticket. ,[parks the boat], Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes. ,[switches places with SpongeBob, making him the driver and Mr. Krabs the passenger],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you're so wise.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles before putting his seatbelt on], Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear! ,[SpongeBob again quickly reverses the boat, destroying the Krusty Krab entrance], Hmm.
,SpongeBob:, Rookie mistake, right?
,Mr. Krabs:, I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage.
,SpongeBob:, Inch, inch. Inch, inch, inch. Inch, inch. ,[does so, but doesn't notice an anchor in the back, destroying the whole front of the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[checks his mirrors], Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand. ,[sees Squidward hitting a customer, Harold, with a spatula], Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh. ,[his eyes deflate, but they quickly return back to normal], ,[thinking in his head], ,All right, Krabs. Get a hold of yourself. You've been in worse fixes than this. Why, you've stared down the cannon's mouth, haven't ya? Look at that face., ,[sees SpongeBob's smile], Bleah! ,Is this the face of your final defeat? Is it, Krabs?, ,[sees SpongeBob's smile more creepy, while also heavily breathing],
,[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's house driveway],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'll say.
,Mr. Krabs:, Just take a look around, boy-o: home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night. ,[sees SpongeBob asleep with covers and Beary the teddy bear before waking him up with the horn], Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to Patrick's house. ,[starts buckling his seatbelt, until...],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick's house! ,[crashes into Patrick's house, flipping Mr. Krabs off the boat and makes a crash landing into the Krusty Krab],
,Harv:, ,[steps over Mr. Krabs], I'll have one Krabby Patty, please.
,Squidward:, Okay.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[to Squidward] ,Upsell!
,Squidward:, ,[sighs] [to Harv], Would you like fries with that?
,Harv:, Yeah, sounds good.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[to Squidward], Better.
,[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, ""Put 'er into gear."" ,[opens the passenger door, but after he said ""put 'er into gear,"" SpongeBob drives the car away from Mr. Krabs, causing the passenger door to come off the boat. SpongeBob then crashes into the Krusty Krab again. The boat is on top of a destroyed table],
,Squidward:, You missed one. ,[the engine of the boat falls off it and destroys a before unbroken table],
,[bubble transition to the boat parked on SpongeBob's driveway],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs], A simple trip to Patrick's house: a line so straight and true.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, let's just leave the boat here and walk.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat. ,[gets an idea], Or can ye?
,[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob at the arcade],
,Mr. Krabs:, You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator.
,[shot shows SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing in front of a driving arcade game],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now hand me one of them tokens. ,[SpongeBob takes out a token. Mr. Krabs inserts it in the coin slot. The game turns on. SpongeBob sits in the seat], You'll need your protective headgear. ,[Mr. Krabs puts a helmet with goggles on SpongeBob],
,Computer on Screen:, Ready? Drive!
,[the screen shows pixelated SpongeBob driving a boat to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, I'm doing it, Mr. Krabs! I'm driving the boat! ,[the screen shows The Krusty Krab spproaching SpongeBob], Uh-oh. ,[brakes and a crash are heard. SpongeBob puts up his googles and sees that the arcade game has crashed into the top of the real-life Krusty Krab],
,Computer on Screen:, Sixth place! ,[the arcade game falls in the Krusty Krab],
,[bubble transition to the boat parked on the road again. A worker goes down a ladder while fixing the broken Krusty Krab, when SpongeBob drives into the Krusty Krab sign, breaking it. The worker climbs back up the ladder. Bubble transition to SpongeBob driving the boat yet again],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, look, Mr. Krabs. I'm driving!
,Mr. Krabs:, Great job, boy. ,[gasps as the boat goes up a ramp and crashes into the Krusty Krab sign, which flips the boat into the Krusty Krab, destroying it yet again],
,[bubble transition to the boat now going through a pipe on the roof of the Krusty Krab, then smashing its doors, while the worker hammers the roof],
,Worker:, Phew. ,[the boat crashes on the worker],
,[bubble transition to the boat breaking a ""One Way"" sign as Mr. Krabs gasps, then screams with SpongeBob as SpongeBob drives the wrong way on the road, avoiding other boats and a gasoline truck. The boat then goes out of control for a few seconds before stopping on the road again],
,SpongeBob:, Well, at least I didn't hit the Krusty Krab that time. ,[chuckles nervously. The scene cuts to the other boats that were avoiding Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob crashing into the Krusty Krab, including the gasoline truck exploding the Krusty Krab with Squidward left standing],
,[bubble transition to the worker giving Mr. Krabs a bill until SpongeBob crashes into the Krusty Krab once more and the worker then increases the bill],
,Mr. Krabs:, Saw that coming.
,[bubble transition to a sad SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. The fire in my belly has gone... ,[imitates explosion],]
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia?
,SpongeBob:, You never!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping. ,[snaps his claws],
,SpongeBob:, ,[while snapping his fingers], Snapping!
,[bubble transition to a busy highway with many signs around],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, my gosh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest!
,SpongeBob:, ,[shocked], Man, I don't think I'm ready for this, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hugs SpongeBob], Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it. ,[puts Gary on the steering wheel],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, I thought you were just using Gary as a colorful example, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go! ,[Gary drives on the roundabout successfully, watching a lot of signs, while SpongeBob covers his eyes], Atta boy! ,[after a few seconds, Gary pulls over,] There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens his eyes], Uh, yeah, some of it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Buck up, me boy-o. ,[points to SpongeBob], It's ,your, turn next.
,SpongeBob:, ,[happily], My turn? Gee, Mr. Krabs, you must really believe in me.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[while he and SpongeBob get out of the boat], Not really.
,[a police motorcycle stops by the boat],
,Police officer:, Sir, is this your vehicle?
,Mr. Krabs:, Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is.
,Police officer:, And did I just see you let a snail negotiate this vehicle through a dangerous intersection?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles], You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example. ,[pats SpongeBob], I was teaching the lad to drive.
,Police officer:, By putting a snail behind the wheel.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Officer, I don't have the boating handbook with me, but...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[interrupts SpongeBob], Quiet, boy! Let me handle this.
,Police officer:, Are you a licensed driving instructor, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles], Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer?
,Police officer:, ,[while writing on a piece of paper], No, I'm married to my job.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together.
,Police officer:, Well, we've had our ups and downs, but after some couples counseling, we think we've worked out our issues. ,[continues writing on the paper],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looks at a smiling SpongeBob], This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[happily], Whoa! My first real traffic ticket.
,Police officer:, ,[to Mr. Krabs], Oh, this is going to require something more than money, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha! What could be worse than spending money? ,[looks at the written paper, then gasps],
,[scene cuts to Mrs. Puff's Boating School],
,Mrs. Puff:, All right, class. Please say hello to our newest classmate...Mr. Krabs!
,Class [except SpongeBob]:, Hello, Mr. Krabs.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers to Mr. Krabs], Don't worry, Mr. K. I'll show you the ropes.

,Intercom System:, Please keep your arms and legs inside at all times. And do not leave the boat until the ride, is over. Thank you!
,SpongeBob:, Uhm, Pearl. Your arm... it's outside the boat.
,Pearl:, Ugh, I will put my arm in the boat. But don't touch me, don't talk to me, don't even look at me!

,Metal Angel:, Will my arrow find her heart?
,Pearl:, Ugh, this ride is lame! Hey! You're allowed to speak now!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Unzippers eyes and mouth], ,[Quickly], I bet Mr. Krabs would get a kick out of this ride, don't you think? I mean he's so tough on the outside, but he's got a soft side, too. You know, this one time I was upset because my snail Gary he was sick and he let me leave 5 minutes early. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard? ,[Mouth becomes microphone], Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
,Narrator:, Two very boring minutes later...
,SpongeBob:, And theeeen, there was that time that Mr. Krabs yelled at me for getting to work before he did, and he didn't even dock my pay. What a sweet man!
,[Pearl gets very annoyed and even more bored],
,Pearl:, ,[screams], You are making this ride even more boring! Is such a thing is possible!
,[Pearl begins to climb out of the boat, but SpongeBob tries to stop her],
,SpongeBob:, You're supposed to remain seated until the ride's come to a COMPLEEETE- ,[SpongeBob is launched up onto the ceiling and knocks over a few hearts. One lands in the water. SpongeBob lands next to a stunned Pearl] Stop! [one of the hearts lands in one of the ride's controls, jamming it. Then, the ride stops],

,Voice over Microphone:, Attention sweethearts! We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain seated.
,[Pearl then becomes frustrated],

,Perch Perkins:, Breaking News! The Tunnel of Glove has turned into a Tunnel of Terror! Just hours ago, the mechanism that controls the boats mysteriously stopped, trapping the doomed couple inside. We have the youth's friends here, who escaped the tunnel before tragedy befell the two sweethearts.
,Nancy:, ,[Crying], It's true! We barely escaped with our lives! It was horrible!
,Perch Perkins:, And what was the name of your friends?
,Nancy:, ,[Still crying], Pearl, and her boyfriend SpongeBob! ,[Both walk away giggling],
,Perch Perkins:, So there you have it. As time quickly runs out ,[Scene zooms out to a big screen with Patrick sitting next to it eating a whole bunch of junk food], still no word from the imperiled whale girl and SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, ,[Startled], Oh, no! I'm out of coral on a stick! ,[Throws stick away], Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!

Once inside, he then looks around], SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh, there you are! ,[Camera zooms in on a control that looks like SpongeBob. Patrick runs to it and grabs it], Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles! ,[He then pulls it off, and bursts through the left wall], You're okay now, buddy! Go to your happy place! ,[Back inside, sparks begin to fly, and then the wires explode, causing the lights in the tunnel to turn off.

,Pearl:, That wasn't me, that was SpongeBob!
,Policeman:, Thank you, little boy!
,SpongeBob:, It's okay, Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's what's in the dark you gotta watch out for ,[scared],. Monsters, creeps, ghouls, CLOWNS, witches, werewolves, CLOWNS, crawly things, CRAWLY CLOWNS, those are the worst CRAWLY CLOWNS.
,Pearl:, Well, whatever, SpongeBob, I'm gonna find my way out! ,[Gets out of the boat],
,SpongeBob:, Pearl! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness.
,Pearl:, Fine. After you. ,[Puts her arm in front],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way...,[screams], Snakes!
,Pearl:, Those are streamers, fool!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Climbs on top of Pearl], Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies.
,Pearl:, Oh, grow up, SpongeBob! ,[slides SpongeBob off her head and SpongeBob falls], There aren't any creepies, there aren't any crawlies, there aren't any snakes! So stop whining so we can look for a way out of here!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire bat fish, and sharks, and...
,Pearl:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ...And I won't talk about ZOMBIES! ,[Scared, obviously],
,Pearl:, ,[Scared], SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks like a pirate], Or ghostly pirates!  ,[Pearl starts being scared, SpongeBob looks like a Frankenstein Monster], Or laboratory creatures!

,Gary:, Meow!
,SpongeBob:, Gary, I just said the pet store was completely sold out of Snail Bites! What am I supposed to do?
,Nat Peterson:, Well, you can try going to the factory where they make them.
,SpongeBob:, ,[picks up Gary and leaves], Thanks a lot. ,[bubble transition to factory], You're what?!
,Factory Worker:, We're closed! Do I have to spell it out for you? C-S-L-O-S-Z-E-D. Cuh-losed! Not only that, but the very last box of Snail Bites shipped out days ago! They were such a hit they flew out of the stores and now, we've run out of ingredients! From what I hear, the owner even dropped out of the pet food business entirely! Yeah, I mean, why wouldn't he, huh? He's made his money!
,SpongeBob:, You see, Gary? There are no more--
,Factory Worker:, I mean, it's not like I wouldn't do the same thing if I were in his shoes!
,SpongeBob:, So, you see, Gary, there...
,Factory Worker:, Why would anybody go around punishing themselves, just for the sake of the happiness of a few pets or...
,SpongeBob:, Would you mind being quiet for one second, please!
,Factory Worker:, Sorry.
,SpongeBob:, Gary, they're completely sold out. There are no more Snail Bites left in the entire world and there never will be!
,Gary:, Meow!
,SpongeBob:, ,[frustrated], What do you want me to do, Gary?! ,[flails his arms in annoyance and frustration], Travel the Earth, checking every pet store in existence to see if they happen to have a box of Snail Bites left? Is that what you want?!

We've been to every single one of them, Gary! And not one of them has the treats you are after! Not one! I can't keep looking, Gary. I just can't.
,Gary:, Meow, meow, meow! ,[bubble transition to SpongeBob's house], Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob! Your snail's still meowing? I have experience with these situations. You're the sponge. He is the snail. You just have to say ""no"" in a very firm voice!
,SpongeBob:, But I don't want to say no to my wittle Gare-Bear! I want him to be happy!
,Patrick:, Well, you gotta be firm, SpongeBob! Sometimes, you have to no when to say know. Oh, wait, wait, wait, it's the other way around. You have to know when to say ""no"". Yeah, that's it!
,SpongeBob:, But I don't know how to say no, Patrick!
,Patrick:, No problem, SpongeBob! You can practice on me! Pretend I'm Gary and tell me ""no"".
,SpongeBob:, ,[grunts], I can't! You're so cute!

Oh, Gary, It's a photo, it's a framed photo of the moment I picked you up at the pound! ,[takes photo and looks at it], I remember that day like it was yesterday. Oh, and a photo of the time you built me a castle made of glitter and lollipops. ,[sniffles], Gary, this is the most special-- Oh! Nice try, Gary.
,Gary:, Meow!
,SpongeBob:, Gare-Bear, we looked everywhere! There are no more Snail Bites. I'm sorry, Gary, but the answer is... no. ,[Gary meows and goes back into house to take a nap, leaving SpongeBob surprised that he won't have to get distracted again. Cuts to Patrick's rock.],

Mr. Krabs:, ,[mimicking SpongeBob], Yeah, yeah, nobody's treasure. You're such a nice boss. You expect me to believe this malarkey?! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick nod], You're a stonewall, eh?

SpongeBob:, Okay, but, would you mind keeping this worthless hunk of junk a secret? Wouldn't be much of a secret if we had a million people showing up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself. People want to see the real thing! It's not like a million people just show up to an old amusement park ride for fun. ,[turns away but stops], Wait a minute. That's exactly what they do. Oh-ho-ho, brace yourself, fellas.

[Patrick opens his mouth and releases an awful odor. Dr. Mundane sees that one tooth is smaller than the rest and pokes it with his dental tools.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Mundane:, Mm-hmm. I see the problem. Your friend here still has a baby tooth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, I wanna see!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob jumps on Patrick's chest and goes in his mouth. In Patrick's mouth, there is a sunken ship in his left cheek and bats fly into his throat. SpongeBob looks and sees Patrick's baby tooth wearing a blue cap sleeping in his jaw.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Aww. Coochie coo!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick's baby tooth cries and Patrick bites SpongeBob in half. He spits out the other half of SpongeBob and puts him back together. SpongeBob giggles.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I still have a baby tooth?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Mundane:, Yes. ,[pulls down his x-ray and shows a bigger tooth trying to push the baby tooth out], And the pain is coming from your adult tooth trying to push your baby tooth out of the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[gasps and pushes the x-ray away], That's not right!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Mundane:, It's the natural way of things. ,[holds out some bigger pliers with sharp edges], If you want the pain to go away, then I need to extract the tooth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Dr. Mundane uses the bigger pliers to open the door and takes out smaller pliers to pull the baby tooth out.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You leave my baby tooth alone, you monster!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick runs away.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, come back!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob follows Patrick out of the dentist office.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Nobody's gonna tell me what to do with my baby tooth! This tooth is staying in my mouth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick. But that means your tooth won't be going to Tooth Island.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Tooth Island?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah! Tooth Island! It's where the Tooth Fairy takes all the baby teeth that are left under pillows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob images up an island with baby teeth swimming in calcium lakes, sleeping in gum trees and swinging on floss-like vines.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Tooth Island is a wonderful place where teeth can bee free! They can soak in the calcium pools all day or sleep in the comfort of the pink gum trees. They get to swing on floss vines and never ever have to worry about cavities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Baby teeth:, Hey, come on over! Come on!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Of course, I guess your baby tooth could be happy in your mouth all alone by itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick's baby tooth cries upon seeing how lonely it is.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I don't care, SpongeBob! I know what's best for my tooth! I can make it happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick walks off. The scene changes to nighttime at Patrick's house. Patrick is wearing a bath robe, has hair on his face, and has hair curlers on his head. Patrick is still suffering pain in his mouth as rubs his cheek and his baby tooth continues to cry. Patrick moves his jaw back and forth.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ♪Rock a bye baby on the treetop♪,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Nothing helps. He grabs some keys and jingles with them. The baby tooth stops crying and giggles at the keys. Patrick accidentally drops the keys.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The keys hit the baby tooth's head and it goes back to crying. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. Patrick is eating a Krabby Patty. But as he chews, he continues to feel pain in his mouth.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob, who is at the grill making Krabby Patties, hears Patrick screaming.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hmm. My friendship sense is tingling. Patrick must be in trouble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick moans in pain.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's the matter, pal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[swallows], Nothing! Just, uh, practicing being a seal! ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick claps and barks like a seal. Craig Mammalton is offended by Patrick's stupidity and angrily walks off.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Ow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, Dr. Mundane always says," """"If you can't bite"," things ain't right.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Okay, SpongeBob. I guess I have to get my tooth to the Tooth Fairy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Ha! You rube. There's no such thing as a Tooth Fairy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob and Patrick gasps],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Squidward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, It's all a bunch of made up baloney.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It is not baloney!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, It is baloney!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Who's got baloney?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[groans], There is no baloney! Just like there is no Tooth Fairy. In fact, if you could prove there were a Tooth Fairy, I would eat, oh, a bucket of chum!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob and Patrick:, Eew!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Squidward, why would you want to do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I said I would, only if there was a Tooth Fairy, and since there isn't a Tooth Fairy, I will never have to eat a bucket of chum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, I've been your friend for a long time. I would never lie to you. You need Dr. Mundane's help so you could get your tooth to the Tooth Fairy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, That's okay, SpongeBob. I think I can manage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick takes out a blender, grinds a Krabby Patty into a smoothie, puts a tiny umbrella and a straw in it, and drinks it through his nose. As he swallows it, a drip of the smoothie falls on his baby tooth and it starts crying again. Patrick cries in pain and falls to the floor.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You see, Patrick? We have got to get that tooth out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You'll have to catch me first!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick runs away.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, wait!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob chases Patrick. But in doing so, he jumps on the barrel and begins rolling in place with it.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Ha, ha! Tooth Fairy! What a couple of molar morons!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob kicks the barrel in Squidward's face and resumes chasing Patrick. Patrick is running down the road. SpongeBob, with some help from two worms, chases Patrick like a cowboy chasing a rustler. SpongeBob takes off his glasses and looks around for Patrick.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, The worms!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick runs through a grassy field. SpongeBob and the worms plow through the field. Patrick jumps over a wire fence. SpongeBob and the worms break through the fence. Patrick stops at a lake, grabs a bamboo stick for a snorkel, jumps in the lake and sucks water in his body. SpongeBob and the worms stop and looks for Patrick. The worms spot Patrick at the lake and Patrick spits water at them, which makes him flying into a tree. On the tree is a wanted sign with Patrick's picture on it. Patrick takes a pencil and writes on the sign.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Not wanted. That fixes it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick sees SpongeBob and the worms catching up to him and frantically climbs up the tree. The worms jump up and down to try to reach Patrick. The worms turn out to be smaller worms.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old Lady:, Mipsey, Pipsey, you bad girls! You get back on this leash!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The two worms go back on the leash and the old lady walks off.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You may have called off your worms, but I'm not coming down!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, they weren't mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, A likely story!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], Patrick, can I show you something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob climbs up the tree and pulls out a scrapbook.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, What's that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It's a scrapbook of all my baby teeth. ,[shows a picture of himself with his baby tooth], Ha. That was a good one. I remember every tooth. Even though they're no longer in my mouth, I still keep the memory of them in my heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[laughs], I thought you kept them in the scrapbook!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, don't you think your baby tooth wants to see all his old friends on Tooth Island?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old Lady:, Don't listen to him! I still have all my baby teeth and look at me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The old lady shows them her teeth and they look incredibly hideous. SpongeBob and Patrick freak out.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Okay, SpongeBob. We can go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the dentist office again.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I'm ready, Doc. Do what you have to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Dr. Mundane extracts Patrick's baby tooth from his mouth with the pliers.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Mundane:, I'm done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, That's it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Mundane:, That's it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Dr. Mundane gives Patrick his baby tooth which it wrapped in a blanket. His baby tooth is now happy.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You're going under my pillow so you can go to Tooth Island my sweet boy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The scene changes to SpongeBob opening Patrick's house open. Patrick is sleeping while his baby tooth is under his pillow. SpongeBob attempts to take the tooth until a light appears and Patrick wakes up.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, SpongeBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[holding a spotlight], Ha! I was right! The Tooth Fairy isn't real!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squidward:, Oh, that's a good one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It's true!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, How can I believe you? All the lies! ,[holds out his dictionary], The chicanery! ,[cries],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[SpongeBob takes Patrick and Squidward to the docks.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, This is where parents and friends take teeth so they can be ferried to Tooth Island.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, There really is a Tooth Ferry!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward drops his jaw in surprise and his eyeballs fall on his tongue.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, Oh, here. This is yours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Could you wait 'til I'm asleep and put it under my pillow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Mm, sure Patrick. Anything for a pal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob puts the dollar in his pocket. Squidward, who is shocked at the sudden revelation, tries to run away.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey! Where do you think you're going, chum chewer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick grabs Squidward and holds him up. Patrick and SpongeBob are now angry at Squidward for what he tried to do.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Hey, come on! This is just a big misunderstanding! Ferry, fairy: They're two different words that just happen to sound alike!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob holds up a bucket of chum meat.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you! ,[flies then digs to Sandy's Treedome, but is stopped by Fuzzy Acorn's stinky feet.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, Who is this intruder that fails to attack me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, That's my friend: SpongeBob SquarePants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Whoa...what was that stench?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, That is what we in karate call; the Smell of Death!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[gets up], You know kah-ra-tay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, He just doesn't know karate, he IS karate. ,[Fuzzy Acorns takes down a fly using his eyebrows], He is the legendary karate master, Fuzzy Acorns. Fuzzy is here to test me for the highest belt in karate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But, Sandy, you already have a black belt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Yes, but there's one even higher than that! ,[points to Fuzzy Acorns' belt], The blacker belt!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gee...I wish I had a karate belt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, ,[quickly moves beside SpongeBob], If you want a belt, you must earn it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Okay? How do I do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, You got caught in the eyes? What do you think I'm here for!?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, I am the mighty oak, and you are but a sapling!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Um...sorry. I'm confused.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, I am here to separate that wheat from the chaff! No? ,[SpongeBob shakes his head], That last one usually works...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, What Fuzzy is trying to say is that he is here to judge whether anyone is worthy of getting a karate belt or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, It is simple. I conduct a series of tests, and if you pass, ,[takes out a red belt], I'll give you a belt that shows you know karate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[bubble transition to a log on two blocks],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, The first test is simple. Split a log with one hand chop, like so. ,[easily chops the log in half], Your turn, ,[places another log down], Karate Man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[walks over to the log], Mm-mmm! Yeah, okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, In turn I will! ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, Just do the thing with the thing please! ,[SpongeBob jumps onto Sandy's wheel and starts to ride around on it while Nat Peterson is seen playing a piano and SpongeBob runs into Sandy], We shall settle this on the battlefield tomorrow!

SpongeBob:, Oh, wait! Sensei!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sandy:, ,[leads SpongeBob out of her tree dome], Better run on home and practice SpongeBob! See you tomorrow! ,[closes the door],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[bubble transition to SpongeBob running up and down stairs. He then lifts weights and runs up stairs more getting tired. SpongeBob karate chops a brick wall but he ends up breaking apart.

He then punches a punching bag but punches it too hard and it slams into him.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Narrator:, Early the next morning...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, My match! ,[tries to open his door but he cannot get a grip on it], I can't get outta here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow...,[opens the door using his mouth],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sandy:, You sure you want to do this buddy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[SpongeBob slowly chops at Sandy but she easily grabs his arm and chops it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Alright! Brace yourself Sandy! 'Cause it's about to get rough and tumble!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[quickly moving behind and in front of SpongeBob], Okay, SpongeBob! You gotta catch me first! ,[SpongeBob starts to spin around and she forces him into the ground],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, Most impressive, Sandy.

SpongeBob:, Okay Sandy! ,[karate chops a picnic table and jumps onto the wooden pieces close to Sandy], Prepare for my finishing move! I call it The Sleeper! ,[falls asleep on the table],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, Very good, Sandy! You put your opponent to sleep in under a minute! ,[touches the table and it falls apart causing SpongeBob to wake up], Too bad your opponent didn't put up a fight. I was prepared to give you the lowest of belts, ,[takes out a transparent belt], The Clear Belt! ,[chuckles], But now, I realize you're unfit to wear a belt of any kind, including the one that holds up your pants! ,[takes off SpongeBob's belt which causes his pants to fall down],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Don't be disappointed, SpongeBob. A belt isn't the most important thing in karate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Easy for you to say, Sandy. Your pants aren't down right around your ankles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, ,[takes Sandy's black belt], And I'm revoking your black belt!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Hey! You can't do that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, Oh, yes I can! For wasting my time bringing me this sorry, excuse for a student! Stick to something you're good at, son.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yes Sensei...,[walks off sadly],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, That was pretty low-down, Fuzzy. The way you humiliated my friend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, The Sponge-One will never earn his belt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, I know SpongeBob will impress you if you give him one more chance!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, Silence! No more chances! Sensei never gives two chances! If you really want to impress me, show me where I can get a decent meal around here. Lunch time approaches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, That's it! I'll take him to the Krusty Krab and then he might just find himself impressed by a certain sandwich maker!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, Who're you talking to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squidward:, ,[sighs], Which is why I keep telling you: Never try anything new, ever! Stick to what you're good at! And stick to it soon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Stick to what I'm good at? Hey, Squidward's right! ,[quickly and easily makes Krabby Patties together. Sandy and Fuzzy Acorns are seen at a table],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, You sure you don't need an air helmet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuzzy Acorns:, This won't take long. Fuzzy has trained himself to go hours without air. ,[SpongeBob is seen jumping through the air throwing Krabby Patties to customers],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, How about them moves?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potty:, Brawk! That's the mariachi band button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick:, Squidward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[screams], That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen!

Patrick:, Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. ,PFAH!, They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement. ,[rides into a cement truck full of cement], Oh. ,[cement unloads on top of Squidward. Squidward tries to get unstuck and is launched through coral field, a sewer pipe, and into a colorful group of jellyfish, who sting him. The cement around him dries and becomes concrete. He falls over and screams out a bubble, then he talks in his thoughts.], Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob. ,[reads sign], Jellyfish Fields. ,[sighs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What is that thing, Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I dunno. Let's get a closer look. ,[both run up to the thing as it's trying to escape],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob. ,[sniffs in the odor coming from Squidward then flushes the tears away. Squidward’s muffled growling causes SpongeBob and Patrick to scream], Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Yeah, help him. Go away! Can't you tell nobody wants you?! You're endangered!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him. ,[muffled shouting coming from Squidward. Cut to SpongeBob's house], Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly. ,[muffled whimpering from Smelly], Here's your food bowl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, And some kibble. ,[pours in some food],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick:, I don't think Gary likes Smelly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Ah! He can come live with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, That's a great idea, Patrick. You’ve always wanted a pet. ,[Smelly tries to escape through the door, but keeps falling down], Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house. ,[opens the door], Bye, Smelly. Have fun at Patrick's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick is dragging Smelly to his house while Smelly tries to get into Squidward's house, but Patrick pulls him away.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets. ,[cut to under Patrick's rock], Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch? ,[throws ball at Smelly], Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. ,[throws ball at Smelly again], Almost. ,[throws ball at Smelly again], Again. ,[throws ball at Smelly again], So close. ,[throws ball at Smelly again but it gets stuck in his eye], Yeah, now you're... ,[Smelly throws the ball at Patrick, knocking him down], Smelly!

Smelly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police:, Freeze! ,[more police cars arrive],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Police:, You're surrounded. There is no way out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Smelly. ,[tries walking through a crowd of policeman], Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police:, Wild animals don't belong here, son. They belong in the zoo. Get 'em, boys. ,[Smelly is taken away in a truck marked 'ZOO' with a vicious, giant clam],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Smelly. ,[cut to the zoo where people are around the habitat of Smelly. Smelly is locked behind a cage marked 'Species Unknown'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Isabelle:, Mommy, what is that thing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sadie:, I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it? ,[everyone laughs. Smelly angrily goes back inside his cage],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, This isn't good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You're absolutely right. ,[takes out a hot dog], It needs mustard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is. ,[whispers to Patrick. Cut to night where Patrick and SpongeBob are wearing black ski masks], Okay, Patrick, remember the plan?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, yeah. ,[takes out a hotdog], This one, right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[grabs hotdog], No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[takes a bite out of the hotdog], Mmm, good plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[ties rope to rail], All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me. ,[climbs down the rope],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You're my hero. ,[gets tangled in the rope], SpongeBob! Help! Ah! ,[screams and makes lots of noises],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Shh, we'll get caught.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, What?! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud! ,[SpongeBob pulls the rope which causes Patrick to fall straight to the ground which, in turn, wakes up Smelly],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[tip-toes over to Smelly's cage], Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home. ,[draws a home with his fingers. Smelly moans], Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick. ,[he does so. Cage door opens and they carry him out], Smelly, you're free! ,[lights are shining on them, they jump out a little with a seal barking sound],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police:, You're surrounded. There's no use trying to run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Run, Patrick, run! ,[as they do, the police climb down into the habitat and chase them], Faster, Patrick. ,[notices a manhole cover and opens it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I'll let Smelly go first. ,[throws Smelly down the sewer. Smelly bounces around before hitting the ground],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us. ,[Patrick closes the manhole cover as police run by it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I think we lost them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob and Patrick:, La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. ,[Smelly moans and whimpers],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much. ,[muffled screaming and wailing from Smelly],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey, I see light.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we? ,[a group of creatures are gathered around in the distance], Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us. ,[creatures turn around to reveal they look like Smelly], Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way. ,[push Smelly on the ground as the group of creatures take him away],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[sniffs], I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Me too, buddy. Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong. ,[the group of gray creatures put Smelly down to where the squid on TV from earlier is playing jazz],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kelpy G:, Ah... salutation, my children. Are you ready for your daily dose of smooth jazz? ,[excited murmuring from the creature. Kelpy G plays. As he is playing, Smelly's exterior breaks and reveals Squidward underneath],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[chuckles nervously], Um... hi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:,7,6,5,4,3,2, ,whoa!, Open for business!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yeah, whoo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, can I do it today? Huh? Can I? Can I do it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], I suppose you can have the honor today, lad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob turns the closed sign to open and laughs and whoops],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[counting money], 37... 38... ,[SpongeBob steps on Squidward's face causing it to get stuck in the register, takes a key, opens up his pants, pulls out a container, opens it, pulls off the plastic wrap, revealing lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Freshness, check. Buns, check. ,[throws the buns on the table with his butt], Fresh patties. ,[throws spatula into the freezer. It spins around and takes a stack of patties back to him], Check. ,[flips the patties on the table], Oh, silly me, I'm forgetting one more minor detail. ,[squeezes his hat out of his head], Oh, yeah. Is it getting hot in here? ,[laughs], Or is it just you? ,[points to the grill. His eyelashes burn off], Ah! ,[takes an order off the line and reads it]," """"Two Krabby Patties. P.S.", SpongeBob, you're an idiot. Love," Squidward."""" Aw", love you, too, Squiddy. Two Krabby Patties, coming right up! ,[twirls Spat], Whoa! ,[it gets stuck on the ceiling. He tries jumping for it], Hmm. ,[cuts to a scene where a pile of stuff is stacked up to the ceiling. He tries to reach it, but it is unsuccessful. Suddenly, some jars of tartar sauce from the pile break causing swords and scissors to fall. Meanwhile, SpongeBob goes up to the ceiling and reaches for Spat. He takes it off by putting his hands on his hips but he doesn't know it], Whew, this thing is stuck pretty good. ,[puts it back in. He gets it out of the ceiling but then he accidentally falls and is about to land the swords and scissors], Whoa! ,[screams], I guess this is it. ,[he is saved by Spat, who gets stuck on a single sword. It slides off the sword and SpongeBob gets on the ground safely], Oh, you really saved me! ,[slips on some tartar sauce, which results in his finger getting run down on a splinter in slow-motion], Whoa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go. ,[he cannot take it off], Oh, that kinda' hurts. Come on. Ooh, that really hurts. Oh, barnacles, this hurts! Conch-shelled manatees, this is painful! ,[tries to use Spat to take it off but fails], ,[ screams and pants], Okay, you're tough, you're smart, and you're charming, but you are still no match for me! Look! A bald eagle with a mustache! ,[tries to pull it off with his teeth, but his face skin rips off revealing his skeleton], Okay, fine, stay. But I hope you like making Krabby Patties.
Nat:, ,[talking to Squidward], Excuse me, sir, but, um, I ordered a couple Krabby Patties a while ago, and I'm wondering when they'll be out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,"[""""crushes"""" Nat's face with his tentacle and laughs]", Looks like I'm crushing your face. ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peterson:, So, will they be ready soon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't move too much, it ruins it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[gets a crumpled note thrown at him. He tries to hold Spat, but the splinter prevents him], Ow. Ow. Ow. You're making this a little bit difficult. Luckily, I am ambidextrous! ,[presses a button on Spat. A string comes out, and he ties the spatula to his nose. He puts two spatulas on the grill using his spatula and flips them, then he picks up one of the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce with his three good fingers. He throws them up in the air and holds up a plate with a patty on a bun on it and the cheese, tomato, and lettuce fall on it. He puts the other bun on top with his pinky], Perfection! ,[puts the Krabby Patties on the window desk and dings the serving bell four times. Before he can ring it a fifth time, Squidward puts his hand on it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I hear you! I hear you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[faces Squidward, causing his spatula to go in his eyes], Okay, good, 'cause these two Krabby Patties are ready!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[growls and goes in the kitchen], SpongeBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Can I ask you something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[smiling with a calm, relaxed voice], What's that? ,[pointing to the spatula tied to SpongeBob's nose],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, You know. ,[flicks the spatula],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Know what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, This.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, This thing here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What thing where?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, The spatula ,[shouting] tied to your nose!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], This! Well, you see, this got stuck up there ,[points to the ceiling but hits Squidward in the nose], so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip ,[holds out his hand but pushes Squidward to the ground], and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead, but then I wasn't, but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all? ,[shows Squidward the splinter], I got this really bad splinter, you see? ,[some pus falls from the splinter into Squidward's left eye], And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose. ,[Squidward gets up], Makes sense now, huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. You're a half-wit who injured himself at work being a nitwit. ,[growls and walks away],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Good one, Squiddy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[grumbles], Injury. Your brain is injured! ,[stops and gets an idea], Wait a minute. Did you say that you got that splinter injury ,at work?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That's ,not, good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I know, it hurts so bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yeah, when Mr. Krabs finds out, oh, man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Finds out what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Finds out about this injury.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You mean my splinter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, He'll be forced to send you home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, H-h-h-h-home? But I'm fine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Here, let me take this for you. ,[takes SpongeBob's hat and spatula],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Why? Hey, wait, I'm fine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, It was a good shift while it lasted. ,[walks into the bathroom. SpongeBob follows him],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, While it lasted? What are you doing? ,[both of them walk into a stall. Squidward flushes his hat and spatula down the toilet.], W... What are you...?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I know it's hard to say goodbye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But, but, but, Squidward, I'm fine! ,[starts tap dancing], I'm fine! I'm okay! Look at me, nothing's wrong! See? See? ,[takes some toilet paper and wraps it around his splinter], See? See?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, I believe you, SpongeBob, but, unfortunately, ,[the toilet paper falls off], the rules clearly state that you must be sent home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, anything but that. ,[goes onto Squidward], Please, Squidward, you can't let this happen! ,[cries], You can't let them force me away!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Sorry, the rules are the rules. ,[SpongeBob continues crying as he clings onto Squidward, who goes into the kitchen], Yeah, it'll be pretty quiet around here with Mr. Krabs sending you home early and all. I just hope we'll make it through the whole rest of this day without you here. ,[smiles. SpongeBob takes deep breaths so hard that he blows air in his face],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Please, Squidward! Don't tell Mr. Krabs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, What? Me? Tell Mr. Krabs? Oh, ,no., No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wew.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, maybe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[screams and holds his heart emitting from his chest],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I don't have to tell Mr. Krabs. ,[SpongeBob is relieved. Squidward leans close to his ear], Because he already knows. ,[SpongeBob's eyes open wide and his nose droops. Squidward grabs two pillows and places them over his ears],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[screams so loudly that the sound waves blow Squidward out the front door, and then comes back in through the back door], He does?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, yeah. Mr. Krabs has preturnatural instincts when it comes to situations like this. It's almost as if when something's amiss in his restaurant... ,[leans close to SpongeBob], ...he can smell it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob and Squidward look out the kitchen window at Mr. Krabs, who is sniffing around. Mr. Krabs smells Frankie's wallet, and two quarters get stuck in his nostrils],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, These quarters smell sad. You're not planning on getting a refill with them, are ya?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frankie:, No, I wasn't. ,[slurps his drink and throws it on the ground and exits],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], You're right, Squidward. I need help! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob dialing a phone number], Please pick up, please pick up, please pick up. ,[Patrick answers but doesn't say anything. SpongeBob taps his foot while waiting], Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Yeah?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], Thank goodness you're there. I got a splinter on my thumb and...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Mm-hmm. I see. Well, I'm pretty booked today, but I think I can fit you in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[opens the back door and sees Patrick sitting in the dumpster with the phone], Thanks, Patrick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, No problem. ,[hangs up. He goes into the garbage and comes back up wearing a doctor outfit],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[putting on gloves], You called the right person, Mr. SpongeBob. ,[grunts], Now, let's see where the problem's at. ,[grabs SpongeBob's leg and inspects it], Hmmm... interesting. ,[sniffs his leg],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uh, Patrick...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[puts SpongeBob's foot in his mouth], Hmmm... interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick? ,[Patrick licks SpongeBob's foot then gurgles and swishes it around like mouthwash],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, this isn't helping!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, I'm sorry. ,[pulls SpongeBob's foot out of his mouth], I didn't realize you were a doctor. Hmph!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'm not!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, but I'm sure you can figure it out with your 12 years of med school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, you didn't go to med school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, So?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm sorry. I really need your help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, no, no, it looks like you have things under control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Please, Patrick! I don't want to go home early! ,[cries],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Okay. But we play by ,my, rules, SquareBob. ,[SpongeBob smiles and nods. Patrick inspects SpongeBob's splinter with a magnifying glass], Well, here's your problem. Don't you worry, buddy. ,[takes out a huge wooden spike and a hammer], We're gonna make it go away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Phew, thanks, Patrick, you're a lifesaver. ,[Patrick places the spike on top of the splinter and lines up the hammer, then he slams the splinter further into SpongeBob's thumb], Ow! ,[his thumb swells up horrifically and grows ten times in size. Patrick is looking down at it. It reaches up to his face],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, There appears to be a little bit of swelling. ,[Patrick picks up a lump of trash], This garbage compress should help that go down. ,[Patrick drops the garbage on the swollen thumb. The garbage slides off of it and the area where the splinter is inserted fizzes a sickly green ooze and turns SpongeBob's thumb a dark purple], That doesn't look good. ,[Patrick's watch beeps], Yeah, but my shift is over. ,[takes off the outfit and puts his hat on], Call me in the morning... if you can still dial the phone. ,[walks away. SpongeBob walks back inside],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Ah. ,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward are there. He gasps],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What's that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Behind your back?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You mean this? ,[pulls his splinter out from behind his back, but it is covered by his hat],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Put your hat on, boy! Show some company pride!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[puts his hat on], Heh, company pride, of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Uh, SpongeBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Have you always had three legs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob has a sock and shoe covering his splintered thumb], Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[believing him], Interesting... Well, what's this about a splinter that Squidward's been telling me all about? ,[SpongeBob screams], All right, boy, let's see it. ,[SpongeBob whimpers], Come on, SpongeBob, it's just a little splinter. I mean, how bad could it...? ,[SpongeBob reveals his massive, swollen thumb which has a slight area of pale green fizz around the impaled center. His thumb is now red. Mr. Krabs gags], Oh, merciful Neptune! ,[Squidward moans and faints], Okay, no problem. No problem. ,[easily picks out the splinter. There is a brief pause and the tip of SpongeBob's thumb pops and shoots out confetti], Problem sol... ,[green pus shoots out of SpongeBob's thumb onto Mr. Krabs' face. He takes out an umbrella as it dies down. There is a close-up of SpongeBob's free hand, bending his splinter-free thumb], Whew. For a second there," I thought I was gonna have to pay you workman's """"compersation.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's worker's compensation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You know, when you get paid for sitting at home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[his eyes shoot open. He gets up], You mean I can get paid while I'm at home?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Yeah," what do ya' think """"compersation"""" stands for?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[gets the cash register out of the boat counter and slowly smashes it onto his head two times], Ow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Uh, Squidward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[smashes the cash register on his head another two times then throws the cash register up into the air and gets crushed by it]," Can I get my """"compersation"""" now?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, No. Sorry, Squidward, your shift ended over two minutes ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward groans, then the episode ends],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Narrator:, Ah... the Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual Free Day. Free balloons...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Narrator:, Free light bulbs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Mr. Krabs unscrews a light bulb from a lamp post and puts it into his pants just as the police arrive],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Aha! Top of the mornin', boys! ,[Laughs nervously], Whew! Next stop: gift shop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Mr. Krabs runs into the gift shop, then SpongeBob and Patrick walk by wearing zoo hats.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[Like an announcer], He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob crumples up his hat and spits it into the air and into a little fish's ice cream],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The two run into the stadium],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob and Patrick:, This is the greatest day of our lives!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Clamu is snoring and gurgling],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You're right, Patrick. We came to see ,[Announcer voice], pearls 100 feet in the air! ,[normal voice], Right? I'll try my oyster call.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob makes a strange noise, but he gives up, because the oyster is asleep.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick walks away.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Come on, come on, wake up already! ,[He pulls out his bag of sea peanuts. He looks left and right and then throws one at the oyster. The oyster stirs.], I think it's working!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The oyster frantically looks around],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, boy, did I miss it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, the show's about to begin!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The oyster suddenly cries at the top of her lungs. SpongeBob and Patrick get blown away to the seats. The oyster hops around while bawling. Two zoo employees come running into the arena.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zoo Worker #1:, What's wrong with Clamu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joe:, Easy, girl! It's me, Joe! Remember?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Clamu snarls as if it sounds like a belch and uses her tongue to throw Joe out of Oyster Stadium. Patrick and a nervous SpongeBob wait at the stands],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Now, this is a show!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Outside...],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Announcer:, Attention, zoo patrons! Clamu, the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage! Please scream and run around in circles. ,[everybody runs for their lives and screams], Thanks for coming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[In the stadium, Clamu is still smashing things and making snarling belch noises. The zoo worker goes up to SpongeBob and Patrick],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zoo Worker #1:, You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster. ,[The worker points menacingly at SpongeBob], You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uh...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob hides the peanut bag],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something? ,[He peers out the window at Oyster Stadium, where we still hear Clamu's wailing], This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do? ,[Cut to SpongeBob knocking on Squidward's door], Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squidward:, You mean you know the guy who did it?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sandy:, Hey, SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[SpongeBob runs down the block panting. He runs to the house and tries to open the door. Patrick approaches him to talk],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob is startled and he falls apart. His limbs and facial features all reattach in different places], This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot, and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it! ,[Zoom in on Patrick's mouth licking what appears to be SpongeBob's head. It is revealed to be instead licking a yellow ice cream pop that appears to be shaped like SpongeBob's head], Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow Popsicle hits the spot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Back at the sewers, the sewer snake continues chasing after SpongeBob and Squidward. They both continue running until they have reached a tunnel.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, In here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob and Squidward enter the tunnel, but it turns out to be the mouth of the sewer snake. The snake closes its mouth, leaving SpongeBob and Squidward trapped inside.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[points to a map], Ooh! Look! You are here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Why is the diagram shaped like a giant sewer snake with an arrow pointed to its stomach?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob is writing on his schedule],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, What are you doing?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh. Crossing digested by a giant sewer snake off of my to-do list. ,[draws a line on his list],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh. That makes sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward then starts to panic and starts to run around inside the sewer snake's stomach.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Snake food!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[As Squidward continues to panic and run around, the sewer snake starts to feel Squidward's moments from inside.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Good going, Squidward! You're tickling him! I'll help ya!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob joins Squidward in running around the snake's stomach. SpongeBob sees the safe on the ground as he runs.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Squidward, the safe! Squidward! Safe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Don't bother me while I'm hysterical!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The sewer snake starts to become sick from the movements in his stomach and vomits everything out including SpongeBob, Squidward, and the safe. SpongeBob and Squidward land safely in the water.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I'm alive? I'm alive!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I guess we're just lucky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The safe lands on Squidward's head.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, look! You found the safe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Just my luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Back at the Krusty Krab Stadium, half-time is about to begin. All of the customers in the stadium head to the restrooms as Charlton frantically runs through the hallways.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, Egads!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The customers flush the toilets as the red siren goes off.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, Too much flushing! She's gonna blow! ,[runs to the sewer control center], How's she holding up?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nat Peterson:, Sir, every tunnel is flooded except for the reducer pipe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The reducer pipe is under pressure from all of the flushing.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, The pinch point!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. Is that bad?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The pipe cannot hold anymore and it explodes with water. SpongeBob and Squidward are carrying the safe back up to the surface until they hear something.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob and Squidward:, Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The flooding water is heading towards them and they get caught inside of it.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, Gaskets blown, manifold mangled, backflow everywhere!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crupski:, Oh, you're overacting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, You flushed it all away, Crupski! You two better hope that fail safe I installed works!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Charlton leaves the control center as water explodes out onto the field. The stadium begins to flood and all of the customers fly into a panic.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food Vendor:, Hot dogs! Popcorn! ,[water surrounds him], Snorkels?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[While everyone panics, Charlton stands near the speaker booth and notices axes on the ground.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, Good thing today was Free Axe Day at the stadium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Charlton puts an axe in his mouth, rips his shirt off, and bravely dives into the water. He swims down to the failed safe, breaks the lock with the axe, and pulls down the lever. The failed safe activates a giant mechanical hand holding a plunger. The hand unclogs the stadium with the plunger and the water flushes down the hole. All of the customers are saved. Charlton pops out of the hole and is very angry. The customers gasp in fear. Charlton climbs out and straightens out his back.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, This is what you get when so-called fish kind and all its humorous and ignorance stooped so low! ,[points to Mr. Krabs and Crupski], As to cut corners and its plumbing system! Extinction is the result of being cheap!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What a bunch of malarkey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlton Hawkfish:, At least we didn't waken the great sewer snake. ,[Charlton sees the sewer snake behind him.], Check that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[All of the customers run out of the stadium upon seeing the sewer snake, but Charlton does not go back down. He throws the axe, pulls up he sleeves, and runs heroically towards the snake. However, he has an idea on how to defeat it. He points to his nose.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sewer Snake:, Uh-oh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Charlton pokes the snake with his pointy nose and the snake flies around like a balloon and falls back through the hole and into the sewers. Back at the Krusty Krab, the toilet erupts with water and floods the restroom. The water bursts out of the restroom with the safe covered in filth. The safe is opened by Squidward who along with SpongeBob are covered in sewage.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Hey, everybody. The cook's back from the toilet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Who's hungry?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The episode ends with the customers freaking out and running from the Krusty Krab.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,[as he runs to Patrick's rock], Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing? ,[Patrick comes out of his rock with a box, doing an acrobatic trick],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, boy, am I!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Here's your net. ,[Patrick glances at his box], Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, First, I have to put away my secret box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box! ,[SpongeBob tries to peek in the box, but Patrick pulls it away],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh! ,[opens the box, laughs at it, and shuts it as SpongeBob tries to peek it], Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life! ,[SpongeBob gets behind Patrick to see what's inside the box, but Patrick holds it to himself],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I've got a gazillion secrets!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Like what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly. ,[Patrick drools as the top of his head has lightning bolts coming out of it, showing that he couldn't understand the whole sentence],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You wanna hear one of my secrets?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Do I?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uhh... Let's see... ,[he runs up to Patrick], Did you know that you're my best friend? ,[he runs away],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh. ,[SpongeBob clears his throat and taps on Patrick's box], Tell me some more secrets!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think jellyfishing and bubble-blowing are the... ,[transition to SpongeBob still telling secrets as Patrick lays his head on the box], ...overbite. I've never been late for work," I've said the word """"fancy"""" in conversation", I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now. ,[he shows his three pairs of underwear to Patrick],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Gasp. I never would have guessed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma. ,[Patrick imagines a carton of milk spilling itself],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh… ,[close-up of SpongeBob's socks], I've got my secret socks on. ,[he runs away and comes back with Gary's bowl], And my secret Gary's bowl! ,[he runs away then comes back, pulling his television], My secret TV! ,[turns on the TV], And my secret TV channel. ,[the TV shows an off-air color bars screen], What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[he giggles, then laughs loudly after a gander at the box and then stops to breathe. He looks again and laughs harder and wildly. He stops to breathe], Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret. ,[he shows the box to SpongeBob], Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box. ,[SpongeBob tries to peek inside the box, but Patrick slams it shut], Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house. ,[scene zooms out to show Squidward's Tiki Head home looking down at SpongeBob and Patrick, but it goes back to normal], It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna… ,[gasps when he finds out his box is gone, The scene cuts to SpongeBob running with Patrick's secret box, but then he bumps into Patrick's belly], SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But, Patrick, I must know the secret!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, For the last time, SpongeBob, no!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Come on, Patrick, just a peek?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Never! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick strain as they fight over the box. Eventually, SpongeBob's arms pop off and he gasps], So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club! ,[he shows his finger with the ring on it and then the camera zooms in on the ring. He grabs one of SpongeBob's arms and points it at SpongeBob], Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants! ,[as he pokes SpongeBob's nose with his arm], If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But... we're supposed to be... ,[his eyes get big and sad], friends forever. ,[flashback to SpongeBob and Patrick as babies in a crib laughing, then we see them as kids riding on a bike, then as they are now, riding a bike, then as older men in rocking chairs, then we see a shot of two gravestones with their names and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing, but they are buried. The flashback ends.], I feel so filthy! ,[he starts to cry], I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself! ,[he jumps on Patrick], I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever? ,[we see a close-up of Patrick's box], The most amazing... ,[as he sticks the box in SpongeBob's eyes, the eyes pop out of him and then back in], mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom. ,[he eyes are glued to the box for a moment, and then goes back to him],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Friends. ,[they shake hands. Cuts to a night view of SpongeBob's house, then inside as SpongeBob talks],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish! ,[he slides down in his bed], Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds. ,[he sits up], Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box. ,[he hides himself in the blanket and shivers], Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party! ,[screams, then jumps onto the bedroom window and talks a little muffled], I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do! ,[SpongeBob's face pops off and sticks onto his back], That's it! How do you look in a secret box? ,[he jumps off the window], Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back. ,[he turns around to show only his nose. He turns back around], Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary? ,[Gary narrows his eyes],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meeh… No. ,[cut to the outside],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, what do you know? You're a snail! ,[SpongeBob sneaks to Patrick's house, puts gloves and a ski mask on him, crawls up the rock with his back, and tears him in half and gets both halves under the rock. He then lands and notices Patrick. He then screams gibberish, drools and SpongeBob hides behind the portrait of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob then peeks and then the wall starts to crack. Patrick mumbles, the wall breaks even more and then the nail falls off. He then grabs the nail with his foot and puts it back.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[as the camera zooms in on the box], Seee... cret.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[thinking], I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up. ,[slides down the wall from the portrait and makes a loud noise upon touching the floor. Patrick stretches and then goes back to sleep. SpongeBob then lifts his leg and then Patrick makes another noise. He then tosses himself over on the bed. SpongeBob puts his leg down, which makes a loud noise],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Duh... who's there? ,[he mumbles then goes back to sleep.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[talking to his foot], Shhh! ,[SpongeBob steps on a potato chip and makes a broken glass sound],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Eh?! ,[gibberish], Who's that?! ,[Patrick is back asleep. SpongeBob sweeps his sweat drops off him and they land, causing a loud splash sound.], Mmm... water. ,[he licks his mouth dry," then tosses himself on the bed. SpongeBob takes another step and makes an """"AWOOOOGA!"""" noise. He then steps again", making a loud machine gun noise. Steps again, making the sound of an elephant. He then stretches his leg near the side of the bed, then takes the step, making a very loud crashing noise. He then peeks above Patrick to see the box. He gets ready to reach for the box, but Patrick takes the box before SpongeBob could grab it. He then slides onto Patrick, grabbing the box], Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside. ,[opens SpongeBob's mouth and pulls out his tongue, then laughs. He lets go of his tongue], Nighty-night, boxie. ,[he puts SpongeBob on the side of the bed. SpongeBob gets off the bed and then trips on a shoestring, causing him to bounce around Patrick's house, making a lot of loud noises until his head hits the wall, causing the portrait to fall off the wall, hitting him in the head, breaking the portrait half. The box then lands on SpongeBob and makes a loud noise. The scene cuts back to Patrick, who, despite all the noise, continues to sleep],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper. ,[Patrick wakes up],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uh…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box! ,[he runs up to SpongeBob], Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life! ,[he cocks his pillow like a shotgun],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop! ,[takes off his mask], It's me, SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[stares at him while clueless], Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, really, Patrick! Look! ,[Patrick gasps. SpongeBob presses a button on the ring],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring:, It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Our friendship ring! It is you! ,[crying as he covers his face with his pillow], How could you do ,thi-i-i-i-is?!?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside. ,[he throws the pillow away and snatches the box out of SpongeBob's hands],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[with a tear coming out of his eye], That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[gasps and tears up], Really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes! ,[he lifts the lid off the box], Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Well, didn't I tell ya? ,[we see a string inside the box], Isn't it great?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It's just a string.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, A secret string!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that! ,[he puts the lid back on the box], Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Good night, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob pops out of Patrick's house],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along! ,[he laughs], Wait 'till I tell Gary!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Squidward walks to the customer with his order on a tray],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frankie Billy:, Come on, man! I just want my patty!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nat:, Yeah, me too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward gives them dirty looks. As he recites his lines, SpongeBob continues to act like a garbage truck],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[gets choked up], Taken for granted, uncredited, overlooked, ignored. Disrespected, unappreciated, unloved. But worst of all...underpaid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Mr. Krabs sits at a table and laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[SpongeBob is still acting like a garbage truck. He stops and notices the patties are burnt. He screams at the sight of the ruined patties],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[He presents Squidward with a plate of burnt Krabby Patties in buns],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Squidward, forgive me. I let the glamour of the stage distract me from my true calling: Making sure that every patty I prepare is the best it can be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Uh-huh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[He takes the patties from SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Mr. Krabs gets a very happy look on his face. The crowd is waving money, also wanting to throw things at Squidward. SpongeBob steps in],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wait! Gentle patrons, Krabby Patties are meant to be eaten, not flung. Think of all the joy these greasy, juicy patties and their attendant condiments have given you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harold:, Gosh, he's right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frank:, We shouldn't be so disrespectful of our favorite meal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets. ,[gasps as he sees a blue jellyfish], Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter! A two fisted Jumper! And a gold-throated stinger!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick:, Oh, sorry. ,[hangs up. The phone rings again], Did you get your net yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net. ,[hangs up. The phone rings again],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hello?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, SpongeBob, I found your net!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick:, Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever. ,[looks out his window and notices Patrick running around with a jellyfish net],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patrick:, Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear:, Oh, maybe you should talk about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squidward:, ,[walking up to his clarinet], SpongeBob... ,[SpongeBob is laughing outside.

Gary:, Meow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kids:, Bird! Yay! ,[SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a snowflake], Snowflake, yay! ,[SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a doll], Paper dolls, yay!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Hey, that little paper does seem like fun. ,[puts his hand over his mouth], What am I saying?! I am such an idiot. ,[laughs], SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun? ,[opens up a magazine and starts reading it], Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun. ,[laughs at what the magazine says inside], Erosion. ,[laughs], Mitosis. ,[SpongeBob laughs. Later, Squidward is bathing], See, I can have fun taking a bath. ,"[the paper comes flying through the window as an airplane and flies around Squidward a couple times as SpongeBob makes airplane noises.

Later", Squidward is painting], Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything. ,[SpongeBob is laughing outside. Squidward paints, but he paints himself with the piece of paper over his nose.

Lil' Squidward:, I don't know, but have you looked in the mirror lately?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, What? What did you...? ,[SpongeBob laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try. ,[folds the paper in half], Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squidward:, Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper! ,[plays 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' off-key. Little black musical note symbols fall out of the clarinet as he plays],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[applauding], Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, What? I didn't play any wrong notes. ,[plays the song off-key again. Little black musical note symbols also fall off as he plays],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah, see, you're playing it like this... ,[plays his piece of paper as the clarinet with the note symbols coming out], ...when ordinarily it goes like this... ,[plays the song on-key at B♭ Major], I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself. ,[Plays a jazzy song with higher notes. A music sheet appears as he plays. Music sheet disappears after finishing the song.], Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[grabs the paper but SpongeBob holds onto it], Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it! ,[SpongeBob still holding on to it], Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go... ,[jumps up and down],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squidward:, I never said anything like that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Sure you did, Squidward, look. ,[folds the paper a few times to make it look like a flip-book to what Squidward said earlier in the day],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[In the flip-book], Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me… ever!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wanna see it again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise. ,[walks off], Maybe I should get going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wait! Hold on there, chum. ,[chuckles], I'm going to make you an offer. ,[SpongeBob looks to see what he has],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wow, pocket lint! ,[shows the pocket lint and rubberband in Squidward's hand], You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, The rubber band? Do I dare?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, dare, dare!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[begins to reach for it], Okay... ,[stops], Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Listen, you! ,[puts his nose against SpongeBob's nose], You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal. ,[Later, Squidward is bringing a TV over to SpongeBob's side in a wheelbarrow], Gotta get that paper. ,[walks back to get more],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bodyguard #1:, No one watches Jim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Jim rings the bell and holds out a burger through the ordering window],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, One patty! The right way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, It's a thing of beauty!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway? ,[Takes a bite out of it], Meh, it's OK. ,[His eyes widen and he is transported to a mystical world, full of stars and patties. He rides on one, but it disappears, and he falls. Suddenly, he becomes one and slides on a rainbow down into SpongeBob's mouth at the Krusty Krab], Wow! That was... amazing! ,[SpongeBob walks up to Jim, who is at a table flirting with girls], Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Oh, hey! You... You're the guy... who sweeps up, right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'm the new fry cook, sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Oh! You made that... stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Besides don't step on the food?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Now that's the way to grovel. I'll do it! ,[Later, we see SpongeBob and Jim in the kitchen, training. SpongeBob hands a completed patty to Jim, and Jim weighs it. SpongeBob is very excited, until he follows Jim into the bathroom and watches him flush the patty down the toilet], The pickle slices were too thick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob grills another one, and flips it into the air, and struggles to somehow make it levitate until Jim says to stop],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Hold it... Hold it... Hold it... Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Later, as SpongeBob is finished crafting the Krabby Patty, Jim steps on it and lifts his foot, covered in mustard],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Now, too much mustard, see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob takes his finger and licks some off. Cut to SpongeBob making more patties, Jim taste testing them, and then flushing them. Eventually, the toilet gets so full, that it backs up. After trying to flush the patties down the toilet, SpongeBob runs out of the stall, crying. Martin approaching the stall sees this],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Martin:, Oh, man!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Am I a fraud?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[He cries, and Squidward knocks on the door],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Crying my eyes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Why, Squidward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob bursts into tears],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Really? ,[Upbeat salsa music starts to play], Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob walks into the bathroom and sits on a pile of waterlogged patties],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign. ,[He clicks his spatula like a pen, and starts writing on a roll of toilet paper]," """"Dear Mr. Krabs","...""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Later, he walks out of the bathroom to see a crowd towards the front of the Krusty Krab],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[Gasps], Me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Come here. Help us cheer for Jim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All But Mr. Krabs and Squidward:, Hip, hip, Hooray!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob runs into the kitchen],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain. ,[Kisses the grease stain and runs into the freezer], Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Narrator:, 298 frozen patties later...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[Runs out of the freezer], Goodbye, freezer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob hides in the freezer as Mr. Krabs walks in], SpongeBob? ,[Smells something in the air], That smells like a resignation letter. ,"[SpongeBob leaves the resignation notice under a patty bun on the grill with a flag on the top saying """"Mr. Krabs"""" on it]", SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Jim walks in],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Hey, great idea! And you can give me a raise!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[They laugh over their own little joke, and SpongeBob watches from the freezer window],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, What are you thinking, SpongeBob? I'm not taking your job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab. It all started on a warm summer evening. Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions. ,[Flash back to Jim and Squidward, both with hair, talking at the Krusty Krab], We should open our own restaurant and stop relying on old man K's pockets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, What if it never does? Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[His hair disintegrates and falls out of his head instantly],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr. Krabs. ,[Walks into Mr. Krabs's office], Hey, Mr. Krabs, you gotta second?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Cut the gas, Krabs, and dig this: I've been bustin' my conk for you. You better lay on some extra gravy, or I'm going to agitate the gravel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, You know, lay a patch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, 'Scuse me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Give me a raise, or I'm quitting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:," A raise? That's not in my """"Hiptionary"""". Help me get with it", Jack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Stop talking like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, These sideburns aren't real.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Mr. Krabs rips them off],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Mr. Krabs starts laughing uncontrollably. When he doesn't stop, Jim leaves, not stopping to listen to Squidward's complaints about his hair.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[End of flashback, and the scene is back to the modern day Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is still laughing],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then. ,[sighs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Scene cuts to Squidward crying and sighing over his bald head],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wow! I never thought about it that way!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, So, you'll stay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Then back to work!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob runs off the screen],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jim:, Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker. The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump. Good luck, SpongeBob. You're gonna need it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh, she's a dump, alright. But she's my dump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barg'N Mart P.A.:, Attention, shoppers: We've got a SpongeBob on Aisle 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob comes out of Aisle 6 with Patrick on his head while riding his unicycle and scaring the customers. But SpongeBob couldn't see where he was going due to having a blindfold on his face.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Make a sharp left!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob and Patrick ride down the hallway where it leads to the locking dock. They bash through the door and crash land in a junkyard of boxes outside.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, We're here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[takes off his blindfold and pulls himself together], I still don't understand why you had me wear a blindfold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, um, I didn't want you to get anything in your eyes. ,[widens his eyes], See? ,[his eyeballs are covered in dead flies, hair and a string tangled on his left; he pulls the string out, which grosses SpongeBob out a little; Patrick and SpongeBob then walk over to a box with a picture of a door drawn on it], Okay, thanks, buddy. I'm going to my club meeting now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's your club, hmm? ,[giggles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Uh, it's the Empty Head Society. Eh, it's a place where guys like me can give their ,[reads card]," """"powerful intellects"""" a much-needed rest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Whoa! I'd love to rest my intellect. Can I join?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Sure! Anyone can join. It's exclusive. ,[SpongeBob giggles and attempts to go into the box by pushing it, but nothing happens], Oh, that's not how you open it. ,[pulls out a stick and draws a square in the sand], You have to step on the automatic doormat. ,[SpongeBob steps in the dirt square], Ding! ,[Patrick lifts the box up and they both climb inside],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Inside the box, there is a bunch of people, who appear as club members, acting in a goofy and idiotic manner similar to Patrick. One is eating a hot dog while being hung on a pole. The other is dancing on a blobfish member's fez. Two fish are playing with a lighting upside-down on the box's ceiling. One is dancing to the music with a chicken on the record player.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wow. They do seem blissfully brainless. ,[prepares to walk over and join],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, oh, hold it! ,[grabs SpongeBob], You have to check your smart thingy at the door.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Howard Blandy is in line at the check-in station, texting on his phone. He checks in by opening his head and give his brain to a lobster club member, who then gives him a fez. SpongeBob gets his turn. He reaches into his head and pulls out his brain, leaving his brain stems sparking. He gives his brain to the lobster club member, who also gives him a fez. Patrick gets his turn as well. He pulls out his eye and pushes out his brain, which is quite tiny compared to the others. The lobster club member gives Patrick a fez. One club member approaches SpongeBob and Patrick.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sheldon:, Hello, numbskull.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hiya, dodo!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sheldon:, Shall we do the Empty Head handshake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Okay!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick and club member dig into each other's mouths and give their handshakes with their tongues. One club member looks at the clock drawing next to him. He lifts a cinderblock and crushes his feet with it, screaming his head off in pain.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[gets startled by the screaming and hops in Patrick's arms], What was that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, The signal for the meeting to start. Come on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[All of the club members rush over to the stage, nearly knocking over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick trips on a pail and begins rolling around. The pail bumps into a fallen member and sends them flying over to pile of pails in front of the stage. The club members then pounce on both SpongeBob and Patrick. One member removes the chicken from the record player and replaces it with a ham. The club president, the Ice Cream King, walks up to the stage, but trips over his own feet. He taps on a roll of toilet paper as if he's tapping a microphone.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice Cream King:, Good, I see everyone's in their assigned places. The secretary will now read the minutes. ,[lifts his belly and pulls out his secretary],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice Cream King's secretary:, ,[reads off the back of the Kelpo cereal box], These are the minutes. One minute, twelve minutes, wait a minute, give me a minute.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice Cream King:, Hike! ,[kicks his secretary off the stage], Are there any new initiates here tonight?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[whispers], SpongeBob, go up. You always wanted to join the club. ,[launches SpongeBob up to the stage by bashing his fist on one club member's buttocks],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice Cream King:, ,[looks suspiciously at SpongeBob as he giggled nervously], Hmm, are you sure you're, uh, brainless enough? ,[SpongeBob looks around and kicks the plank below him, which hits him in the face], Perfect! You've earned your first badge. ,[gives him a bacon strip as a badge; SpongeBob giggles weakly and gives Patrick a thumb's up], It's time to pass the jar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hmm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[One club member opens an empty jar and drools saliva into it. She passes it to a blobfish club member and he wrings saliva from his tongue into the jar. He passes the jar to an eel club member and he turns his fez like a faucet and pours saliva into the jar. He passes the jar over to SpongeBob.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hmm? Uh... ,[spits a drop of his saliva into the jar],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Empty Head Society club members:, Drink! Drink! Drink!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob groans in disgust and tries to hesitate in drinking the jar full of saliva.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Empty Head Society club members:, Drink! Drink! Drink!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob gives in and drinks all of the saliva from the jar. He gags himself as he tries not to throw up and burps out a saliva bubble from his mouth.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Empty Head Society club members:, ,[shocked and grossed out], Ugh!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What? You said drink!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice Cream King:, ,[taps SpongeBob's shoulder], Ahem. ,[points to the lemonade stand next to him], Lemonade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice Cream King:, ,[takes the empty jar and puts it on the shelf where he keeps the other jars of saliva], We just save and date the drool. But that was so dopey you earned another badge! ,[pulls out used chewing gum from his mouth and puts it with SpongeBob's bacon badge], There! It's now time to go out in the community and help the citizens...,[flings his toilet paper microphone at an unseen character," screaming """"ow!""""]", of Bikini Bottom by doing our civic duty. Whatever that means.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uh, we're gonna do some civic duty?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:," We call it the """"Nitwitting."""" ",[jumps on the stage and joins in the Ice Cream King and the entire club to sing their oath],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick, Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members:, ♪We're all unfit. We must admit we're dumb as a box of rocks. ,[two club members bash each other's heads], But time permitting, we'll be nitwitting.

Patrick:, I have no idea. ,[honks the horn],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob, Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the Empty Head Society club members ride down the road in their mini boats. The townspeople scream and run away in fear. Lou hops onto his hot dog stand and rides away in it like a horse. An old lady hides into her house and zips her door shut just as the Empty Head Society ride pass. The scene changes to the bowling alley. A bowler goes to make a strike with his bowling ball.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trenchbilly Empty Head Society club member:, Hey, mister. You dropped your ball. ,[swings his hockey stick and hits the ball like a puck, crashing it into the bowler's face],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The two Empty Head Society club members create havoc in the bowling ally by flinging bowling balls at the bowlers. The scene cuts to Larry doing his workout on the treadmill at his gym.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blobfish Empty Head Society club member:, Keep running. I'll pace you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Larry tries to run away, but the treadmill was moving too fast. He then gets crushed by the blobfish club member's mini boat. The scene changes to one of the club members painting happy faces on the traffic light.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shark Empty Head Society club member:, These lights could use a smile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[This action causes a major pile-up in the middle of the intersection and all the drivers complain. One Empty Head Society club member plows through the sidewalk with a lawnmower.

SpongeBob follows by putting bowls on the broken parking maters and pour soup in them.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I have a feeling you guys are a little confused about what civic duty is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[A passing driver parks his boat and throws a quarter into the bowl of soup. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick looking at a garbage can.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Why would people throw their stinky garbage in these beautiful cans? ,[puts the garbage can on his head],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Maybe their pockets were already full.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, ,[his head short-circuits while walking], Well, that's funny. I seem to be lost. Oh, I'll figure it out. I still got so life in the ol' brain stem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob attempts to keep his brain stem alive by sprinkling water with his watering can. But since his brain's been out of his head for too long, they short-circuit and shrivel. All of a sudden, SpongeBob's head and face begin to deform and makes himself appear to be just as brainless as Patrick, the Ice Cream King, and the club members of the Empty Head Society.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[starts to sound goofy], What's a brain stem? I know! I'll just walk backwards and that should get me back to the beginning of the day. ,"[walks backwards while talking backwards; he bumps into a """"No Parking"""" sign]", I'm even more lost-er than I was before-er. ,[gasps as he sees a lady at the bus stop], Oh, I will direct asking—,[grunts in frustration], Ask directions. ,[barks like a seal, hops over to the lady in a goofy fashion and spins his body in front of her], Excuse me, large lady.

[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking alone in a dark alley. He finds an old chair and goes to sit on it. But each time he tries to do so, he ends up doing it wrong. He gives up and sulks in a puddle on the ground.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm all wetty! ,[Patrick grabs SpongeBob, stretches him and straightens him out as best as he could], I'm ready. ,[gasps as he is back to his normal self], I'm ready! I'm ready! High-five!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Yeah! ,[gives SpongeBob a high-five, but makes his spiral around and around],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[babbles in dizziness and laughs], Patrick, I know you and the Empty Head Society mean well, but man, we sure messed up a lot of things in town today. So, I'm gonna reverse all the damage that we did during the Nitwitting! ,[leaves],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey, you'd better hurry because you're getting smaller! What a guy. Hmm? ,[knocks over the old chair and climbs into it with his head peaking out from the hole], Nothing like a good sit in a chair. ,[sighs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob walks out into the street and goes to clean up the mess the Empty Head Society club members made. But much to his surprise, everything appears to be cleaned up and things are back to normal.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, that's weird. Everything's already back to normal. What? ,[looks down and sees the sidewalk repaved; he walks around and sees the parking meters repaired; he then notices one part of the city that hasn't been cleaned], Hmm. Well, it's still a mess over here. ,[he backs up and bumps into a full trash can; he then meets up with his friend, Sandy, who has been cleaning up the mess all along], Sandy? You cleaned everything up?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Of course, SpongeBob. I belong to a club called F.E.M.A. ,[holds up her membership card]," That stands for """"Fix the Emptyhead's Mess Again."""" Our civic duty is repairing the mayhem that the Empty Heads cause every month. You got some gunk on your tie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah, they're badges. ,[eats the badge the Ice Cream King gave him],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Hey, SpongeBob. How would you like to join F.E.M.A.?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No thanks. After giving my brain a vacation, I need a rest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Suddenly, SpongeBob and Sandy hear something.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both:, Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:," Uh-oh! Speaking of """"brain vacation."""" ",[grabs SpongeBob and hops into the trash can to hide from the Empty Head Society club members as they ride by],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick is among the group and honks his horn. The Empty Head Society club members cause a pile-up in the middle of the intersection and they all sing their oath.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice Cream King and the Empty Head Society club members:, ♪We're all unfit. We must admit we're dumb as a box of rocks. But time permitting, we'll be nitwitting…♪,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[drives through the club members], ♪Has anyone seen my socks?♪ ,[crashes into the screen, ending the episode],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
