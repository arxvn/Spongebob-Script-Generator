"[in Jellyfish Fields],
,SpongeBob:, Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over.
,Patrick:, Robert, Robert...uhh...Ronald, Ronald, Ryan.
,SpongeBob:, Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?
,Patrick:, Oh, wait I got it. Ringo...
,[SpongeBob sees jellyfish],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over.
,Patrick:, Hello?
,SpongeBob:, Please reply.
,Patrick:, I wonder if I can order pizza with these things.
,SpongeBob:, Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you're gonna need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be.
,SpongeBob:, I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud... ,[SpongeBob bumps Patrick and he screams], ... noises.
,Patrick:, Oops. ,[they run away. The jellyfish shrugs it off],
,SpongeBob:, Is he still after us, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I don't know, buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Should we turn around and check?
,Patrick:, Ok. ,[they both turn around and trip over something],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I think I landed on my pain center.
,Patrick:, I think I landed on a rock. ,[Patrick shows a big rock on the back of his head],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there.
,Patrick:, That's just Squidward sunbathing again. ,[Patrick points to Squidward who lowers down his sunglasses],
,SpongeBob:, No, not that, Patrick. This!
,Patrick:, What is it?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up.
,Patrick:, We?
,[cut to large piles of dirt],
,SpongeBob:, Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I'll say. ,[his entire chest is covered with hair while monkey sounds are heard.],
,SpongeBob:, Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO! ,[looks inside], Go on, you first. ,[Patrick climbs down a ladder with SpongeBob following], Kinda dark, huh?
,Patrick:, Yeah, dark.
,SpongeBob:, Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir. ,[pulls off a skeleton and proceeds to start the submarine], Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!
,Patrick:, Now hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive.
,SpongeBob:, Gimme that wheel!
,Patrick:, No! Let go! I wanna drive! ,[the submarine goes crazy. scene cuts to the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.
,Squidward:, Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.
,Squidward:, Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?
,Mr. Krabs:, Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?
,Squidward:, La la la la la la la la la la la la.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, of course! But how? ,[the submarine crashes into the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Can we park here? ,[Squidward looks up], Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey.
,Patrick:, Or even around the block!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road. ,[cuts to outside], So long, boys. Make me lots of money!
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs. ,[flirtatious], Bye, Squidward.
,Patrick:, You said ""Bye, Squidward"" twice.
,SpongeBob:, I like Squidward.
,Plankton:, ,[looking through a telescope], A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take his turn. ,[laughs and turns the fist from the Chum Bucket building into a flying vehicle],
,SpongeBob:, Hello!
,Man:, Hello.
,SpongeBob:, Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?
,Man:, No thanks.
,Patrick:, Now what?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back. ,[to Man], Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir.
,Man:, Yeah, I'm pretty sure. ,[starts to walk away],
,SpongeBob:, Wait! We'll pay ya!
,Man:, Hey, thanks again, guys. Good luck with the restaurant!
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, sir, come again!
,Plankton:, Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected. ,[an alarm sets off],
,Voice:, Customer approaching.
,Plankton:, Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?
,Boy:, Uh, does it come in raspberry?
,Plankton:, Um, no.
,Boy:, Blueberry?
,Plankton:, No.
,Boy:, Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...raspberry?
,Plankton:, Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already. Now quit wasting my time!
,Mable:, Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are?
,Plankton:, I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers.
,Truck Driver:, Hey, you can't talk about my wife that way. What do you think this is?
,Plankton:, I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is.
,Mary:, Hey, you can't talk to my grandson like that. Someone oughta put you in a mental hospital.
,Plankton:, Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma! (BOOSH ROASTED)
,Mary:, You're probably right.
,Plankton:, You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here. ,[a person throws a rock at Plankton], What the? ,[the crowd starts throwing rocks], No! Controls malfunctioning! ,[people continue to throw rocks],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Yeah?
,SpongeBob:, Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty? ,[cut to the kitchen, where the patties are burnt], Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?
,Truck Driver:, ,[sees there are no more rocks], Hey, the rocks are all gone.
,Crowd:, Aww! ,[Plankton smiles, but sees SpongeBob coming],
,SpongeBob:, Folks, have I got a deal for you. ,[the crowd sees the hard patties and eagerly buy them],
,Jack:, Alright, get 'em! ,[they start to throw the patty rocks at Plankton],
,SpongeBob:, Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick?
,Patrick:, No, but I see a sign. It says. ""Warning: Ab...eyes?""
,SpongeBob:, Here, let me see. ,[looks through periscope], No, Patrick, that says ""Abyss.""
,Patrick:, Oh, OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, An abyss is a bottomless... ,[SpongeBob turns around, the submarine falls down the abyss], ...chasm! ,[an alarm goes off], Pat, we're falling!
,Patrick:, And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!
,Plankton:, ,[he sees them falling], Yes! Yes!
,Patrick:, [the submarine loses its bolts and breaks in the water] And now a deafening warning siren! ,[SpongeBob imitates the sound. the submarine hits a sludgy item, which turns out to be the head of the Sea Monster],
,Sea Monster:, ,[shouts],
,SpongeBob:, Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss! ,[looks at the Sea Monster],
,Sea Monster:, Hey! ,[he grabs the submarine and looks into it], Who are you calling dark and depressing?
,SpongeBob:, Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?
,Sea Monster:, Hungry? I've been asleep for 79 years. Which means my last meal was 79 years ago. Yes, I'm hungry.
,SpongeBob:, Then try one of our Krabby Patties.
,Sea Monster:, ,[eats the Krabby Patty], Mmm! That's the best thing I've tasted since that sewer spill...back in '76. I'll take 640 of them.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Woo hoo!
,Patrick:, Order... uh... up! ,[the Sea Monster gives them large wads of cash],
,Plankton:, Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. ,[looks at the Sea Monster paying them big money ,[literally],, he rips off the periscope], This calls for drastic-er-est measures! ,[Plankton goes into the abyss], Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!
,Patrick:, ,[the Chum Charges explode around the submarine], SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?
,SpongeBob:, No!
,Patrick:, ,[after a pause], Neither do I!
,Plankton:, Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the... ,[Plankton sees the vehicle crashing into a cavern wall], Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow.
,Sea Monster:, Come on in there! I want more sandwiches!
,Patrick:, ,[a piece of chum enters the submarine], SpongeBob, look!
,SpongeBob:, What is it?
,Patrick:, It's a liquid.
,SpongeBob:, No, it's a solid! It's a solid!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, It's a ""lol-squid.""
,Sea Monster:, All right, what's going on in there? ,[he sees the Chum Patty], Hey, that looks like a sandwich to me!
,SpongeBob:, But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich.
,Sea Monster:, ,[eats it and likes it], Mmm! Now that's a sandwich!
,[cut to a sequence of SpongeBob making Chum-Wiches, Patrick collecting the Chum, and the Sea Monster paying them for the Chum-Wiches.],
,SpongeBob:, [the monsters belly is still rumbling] Anything else before we shove off?
,Sea Monster:, I want dessert! ,[Plankton parachutes down],
,SpongeBob:, We- We don't have desserts.
,Plankton:, ,[lands from his parachute], Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my... ,[the end of the periscope breaks off, he falls down and rolls into some wet mud],
,Sea Monster:, Hey, a chocolate éclair! ,[to audience], Now that looks like dessert to me!
,Plankton:, No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You- You've got it all wrong, see... Hey! ,[the Sea Monster chases Plankton through the abyss. cut to the Krusty Krab],
,Janitor:, ,[repairing the windows SpongeBob and Patrick broke previously], There you are, Mr. Krabs, just like new again.
,Squidward:, Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the... ,[the submarine crashes into the windows again],
,SpongeBob:, We're back, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!
,SpongeBob:, You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers!
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't care about that. Tell me about the money.
,SpongeBob:, There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy.
,Patrick:, And paper.
,Mr. Krabs:, You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?
,SpongeBob:, ,[he and Patrick nod their heads, Mr. Krabs is upset], But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!

"[Episode starts where SpongeBob feeds Gary. SpongeBob pours the organic snail food into Gary's food bowl and Gary eats the organic snail food. SpongeBob throws the can of organic snail food by the dirty dishes, and a barrel hits SpongeBob back in the living room and his can of snail food lands on his nose. Gary slithers to him.],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Okay, Gare. I'll get out of your hair, buddy. ,[pushes his nose and his Krusty Krab uniform hat pops up from his head He walks out the door], See you later, Gare. ,[Gary is seen holding a leash in his mouth], Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, buddy, I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get over the old job. You'll just have to stay here alone, little buddy. But I promise as soon as I get done we'll have fun... together. Okay.......Love you, Gare-bear. Bye. ,[goes outside and closes the door. Gary picks up a leash. He lassos the leash and opens the top cabinet and gets out a can of snail food and puts it next to them. He lassos the soda drinking cowboy hat and floats it right on top of the chair he slithers towards the chair with the remote in his mouth, while the soda drinking cowboy hat lands on his shell. He turns on the TV as we see a cowboy riding a sea horse],
,SpongeBob:, Poor little snail just wanted some fun time. ,[sighs], I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now. ,[walks away, while Gary is watching T.V. laughing and meowing. Cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is sweeping all the dust from the floor with his broom next to the customer sitting at the table eating a Krabby Patty. Another customer walks in], Welcome to the Kru- ,[notices that he has a purple pet worm on a leash which barked], Sorry, sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside.
,Customer:, Oh, I could never do that. He gets far too lonely and upset when he's left alone. ,[to his pet worm], Sorry, buddy, I guess I can't buy you that Krabby Patty you wanted. Let's just go home.
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh? ,[walks towards the customer blocking the double doors], Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price. ,[laughs], SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties. ,[we hear Gary meow inside SpongeBob's head],
,SpongeBob:, Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay. ,[walks towards the phone and answers it and calls Gary but no answer], Too distraught to even answer the phone.
,Phone:, ,[in SpongeBob's voice], Hello. You've reached SpongeBob and...C'mon Gary. ,[in Gary's Voice], Meow. ,[SpongeBob's voice], Gary. ,[laughs], The two of us are having too much fun together to answer the phone right now. so, leave the massage and will call you right back. Not as long as we take a break and have fun... together! ,['SpongeBob and Gary laugh],
,SpongeBob:, My outgoing message is a lie. ,[cut to SpongeBob's home where Gary is still watching the TV on the phone], Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up...
,Gary:, ,[meowing and laughing and drinking a soda in a cowboy hat],
,SpongeBob:, Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon. ,[hangs up the phone and sighs. cut to that night where SpongeBob changes the ""open"" sigh to ""closed"" sigh and walks out the door where he closes the double doors. Just then we see Mr. Krabs working on the tar machine],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, well, well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever.
,SpongeBob:, Really, Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot.
,SpongeBob:, You're the best, Mr. Krabs! ,[cut to SpongeBob running home], Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?
,Timmy:, Wow, Dad, is it really mine to keep?
,Fred:, Sure, son. Now you have a furry friend to give your pet without getting lonely. ,[SpongeBob stops and sees Timmy with a blue mini eel], And now Daddy can go on his business trips guilt-free.
,SpongeBob:, Maybe if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work.
,Timmy:, Hey, thanks, Dad.
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs over there], They're so precious! ,[we see a bunch of mini colorful and cute eels surrounding the mysterious store owner lady], SOLD! I'll take that one right there!
,Store Owner:, You wish to have one of my rare and extremely dangerous... huh?
,SpongeBob:, Oh yeah, this is the one. ,[picks a green mini eel which is in a small cage],
,Store Owner:, Beware, boy, this is no ordinary pet!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!
,Store Owner:, You must to understand. These pets can be very unstable. especially around other pets! ,[shows a picture of a cat next to another green mini eel which he growls at it],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye. ,[walks off],
,Store Owner:, Why bother? They never listen. ,[sighs],
,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house where Gary is still watching TV, drinking a soda from the soda drinking cowboy hat],
,T.V.:, Sheriff, I've caught the bank robber. ,[throws a small cowboy hat on the table], There's your culprit right here. Now cuff him. ,[SpongeBob appears from behind the T.V],
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Gary!
,Gary:, ,[Sees SpongeBob by taking off the drinking soda cowboy hat then gets bored], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I've brought you a surprise. ,[takes out a mini green eel from behind his back], Your very own play pal. ,[sets it on the chair next to Gary], His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other. I'll be right back.
,[He runs off to get something. Gary meows at Puffy Fluffy, who takes one look at him and snarls. SpongeBob comes back with Gary's food bowl while Puffy Fluffy returns to his cute self.],
,SpongeBob:, Eat up, you two. ,[sets food bowl down and pours a can of snail food inside it. Gary slithers to his food bowl and starts to eat but SpongeBob stops him], Gary! What happened to your manners? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy. ,[SpongeBob gets a marker and writes Puffy Fluffy's name with a slash ""Puffy Fluffy"" on the food bowl], Come here, you. ,[sets him next to the other side of Gary's food bowl], There you go, Fluffy. Now eat up, I'm gonna go make some enchiladas.
,[He walks off; When Gary starts eating his food,  Puffy Fluffy scares him, eats Gary's food bowl and Gary runs and hides behind the wall next to the TV. Puffy Fluffy chases after him and is about to eat him when SpongeBob comes back],
,SpongeBob:, Done! ,[Puffy Fluffy returns to his cute self], Oh, these enchiladas are hot, hot, hot! ,[sits down on the chair and begins to eat when he sees Gary hiding behind the TV, scared], Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends. ,[picks up Gary and Puffy Fluffy toward the toys], Why don't you two play a little? That will help you bond. ,[went back to his chair], Great, now my enchiladas are cold.
,[Gary plays with his squeaky toys with Puffy Fluffy when Puffy Fluffy scares him. Fluffy rips the squeaky carrot toy with his sharp teeth onto SpongeBob's enchilada dinner. Puffy Fluffy jaws on Gary, but Gary runs and hops on SpongeBob's head],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, what has gotten into you, boy, huh?! ,[picks Gary from behind his head], Because you refuse to show the least bit of respect for our new friend, and because you have ruined my enchilada dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight. ,[cut to the living room where SpongeBob puts Gary down on a small bed], I hope you're happy now.
,Gary:, ,[doubtful], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Good. Maybe you can extend that happiness your new friend. ,[sets Puffy Fluffy on the small bed and Gary gets scared. SpongeBob covers them up with a small green blanket], Aww, look at you two so cute together.
,Gary:, Meooooooow.
,SpongeBob:, I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night.
,[He walks off to bed when Puffy Fluffy snarls at Gary; cut to SpongeBob going in his bed in his room],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with. ,[goes to sleep when Gary bursts through the door and runs toward SpongeBob scared],

Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please? ,[sets Gary back on a small bed and covers him with a small green blanket], Good night. ,[He turns off the light and closes the door. Gary looks at Puffy Fluffy but his skin deflates, revealing that it was not him. Just then there's a noise coming from the down stairs kitchen. Gary goes into the kitchen and sees a big green thing behind the fridge eating. Gary slithers over there. It is Puffy Fluffy as a monster, and it roars.],
,Gary:, Meow!
,Puffy Fluffy Monster:, ,Rawr!, ,[sticks out four tongues with large sharp teeth],

,SpongeBob:, I don't know about this, Patrick.
,Patrick:, You must defeat your reason, before you can start... ,[jumps up in the air again, then stops], ...living like Larry! ,[he then goes into a boat], Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it! ,[he gets smashed from the sides, cringing SpongeBob until his stunt end, then cuts back to SpongeBob as the rest happens.

,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Patrick, this looks very danger... ,[Patrick attaches a skate board on SpongeBob's back, then does so with him],
,Patrick:, Here's to living like Larry!
,SpongeBob:, Well, wait a minute, Patrick, I think your missing the point. ""Living like Larry"" doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life.
,Patrick:, Don't you mean, cost us our lives, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going.
,Patrick:, I see. And that's your final word on the subject?

,Tough Guy 1:, Don't make us come in there, kid! ,[captions version Gang Member: Don't make us come in there, kid],
,SpongeBob:, Now, you just let me handle those guys out there. ,[SpongeBob walks outside], Gentlemen, Gentlemen.
,All:, What the?
,SpongeBob:, I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look ,[scene reveals Patrick is a shell], So let me assure you, his days of ""living in the moment"" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did? ,[they thin],
,Tough Guy 2:, Sure, pal. Sure. ,[Shakes Patrick's hand],
,SpongeBob:, By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky? ,[SpongeBob leans on there motorcycles, and they fall],
,Tough Guy 2:, He knocked over our motorcycles! ,[SpongeBob laughs nervously, then they chase SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, So scared! Adrenalin pumping! ,[getting excited], Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah, baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo! ,[gets knocked in the air by a motor cycle], Now I am finally living like Larry! ,[cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick on top of ballast],
,Patrick:, Are you sure about this, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, come on, Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?
,Patrick:, I don't know, SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Immediately slaps Patrick in the back], Yeah, yeah, you said it, buddy! Now we're really living like Larry! ,[Larry notices them on the ballast],
,Larry:, Well, would you look at that. Now there's two guys who know how to live!
,SpongeBob:, Prepare for countdown!
,Larry:, I'm proud of them. ,[takes a closer look], Wait a minute, with that angle of trajectory, they'll land right in...Rippers Reef! They'll be ripped to shreds! ,[runs over with a life preserver with rope tied to it], Wait, don't do it! Stop!
,SpongeBob:, 3-2-1 Lift off. ,[pulls a rope, which causes the arrow to set off],
,Larry:, Drat! ,[uses the life preserver to catch on to the arrow],
,SpongeBob:, Whooooo! Whoohooooo! Whoowoowoo! ,[life preserver catches arrow, it falls down to Patrick and notices it],
,Larry:, Whoooooa! ,[climbs rope], Look, guys, my advice wasn't meant to be taken literally! I meant to live life to the fullest, not to maim yourselves! Look! ,[then notice the reef],
,Patrick:, Uh-oh!
,Larry:, ,[panics], Aaaahhhh! ,[Shows Rippers Reef then flips back to happy SpongeBob and screaming Larry], Aaaaahhhh! ,[they crash into it and yellow stars on a black background appears, then cuts to scene of them in the hospital],
,SpongeBob:, What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more. ,[Looks crazy in eyes], What would Larry do?
,Larry:, ,[angry], What would Larry do? I'll show you what Larry would do! ,[chases SpongeBob], Come here! Come here, I said! Hey! ,[Chases him off the screen and episode ends],

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grunts], You should give up while you can, Mermaid Man.

Ah! ,[flies onto the stage like a rocket], Thank you, everyone! ,[hugs all of his friends], I loved the show! And I loved the love you showed me! And I love how you showed me the love you showed me in the show I love. ,[his eyes widen], This is my favorite episode of ""Mermaid Man"" ever!

,Old Man Jenkins:, Hey! What are you kids doing in my outdoor amphitheater?
,Sandy:, ,[screams], Cheese it, everyone! It's Old Man Jenkins! ,[screams],
,[Everyone, except SpongeBob, run off the stage.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Come back! I just wanna be in the play.

,Squidward:, How 'bout the latte sipping?
,Larry:, And what about the pumping of the iron?
,Plankton:, And diabolical conspiracies?

,SpongeBob:, I know what you mean. Sometimes it feels like I've been waiting my entire life to go on this trip!
,Patrick:, Really? Why is that?
,SpongeBob:, Probably because I have.
,Patrick:, Have what?
,SpongeBob:, Been waiting.
,Patrick:, ,[Breathing heavily], Wait... you mean so... What?

,[Cuts to the car driving on the ride with Patrick silently banging on the window.],
,Harold:, Alright, boys, alright, turn down the volume back there.
,Margaret:, ,[Turns to face the backseat], I have an idea! Why don't we play a road game to pass the time?

,Patrick,: ""Like a slide.""
,SpongeBob,: ""Bounced off a huge anemone...""
,Patrick,: ""Like a trampoline.""
,SpongeBob,: ""Hid in a nest!""
,Patrick,: ""Like a fort!""

"[The camera zooms in on SpongeBob sitting crying in the area between his pineapple and Squidward's house. He lies down face-down and his tears send him up and down off the ground. He goes back to normal crying while sitting, he then bends his top half in towards his bottom half. Patrick walks up, Picks SpongeBob up, and pats SpongeBob's back],
,Patrick:, There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.
,SpongeBob:, ,[He pops off Patrick's shoulder], Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for two whole days.
,Patrick:, Two whole days?! ,[tears pour out of his eyes like a hose as he begins to wail],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!
,Patrick:, Tejas! ,[Cries],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles, looks at his watch], She won't be back for one more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds.
,Patrick:, Oh, 47 seconds! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick cry tears in each others faces], I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles, ,[waves his arms], the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose. ,[a nose like Squidward's pops onto his face],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, that's Squidward. ,[Patrick's Squidward-like nose disappears], He's not gone, he's right here. ,[pan over to Squidward planting a flower],
,Squidward:, ,[He is shown wearing a gardening hat and holding a shovel and holding a flower in one hand and a trowel in the other. He is also digging a hole. He finishes digging the hole and looks at SpongeBob.], No, I'm not. ,[drops the flower into the ground and walks into his home, slamming the door behind him],
,SpongeBob:, I sure do miss that squirrel. ,[sniff], Her karate chopping, ,[karate chops ground], that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth? ,[his buck teeth come together and sparkle. They return to normal.], After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.
,Patrick:, Is Sandy the one I call Mom?
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome! ,[runs off, distorted trumpet fanfare plays],
,Patrick:, Wa-hey! ,[Patrick runs after SpongeBob.],
,[The scene changes to show Sandy's house. SpongeBob and Patrick sneak into it with party supplies. SpongeBob twirls the handle open and the two run in and start painting on a blue banner with light blue paint. SpongeBob writes from left to right, and Patrick does the opposite. They run out of space on the banner, and it reads ""WELCOMANDY."" Balloons rise up, transitioning to Patrick inhaling deeply. He holds an un-inflated balloon to his water helmet and tries to blow it up, failing. SpongeBob walks over, knocking on Patrick's Helmet to get his attention. He looks up at the tree. Patrick and SpongeBob jump out of the tree holding balloons. The balloons fill with air as the two float down. They stop, floating in mid-air just above the ground and start to kick their legs trying to reach it. There is another balloon transition to SpongeBob icing a cake which reads ""WELCOME HOME SANDY!""],
,SpongeBob:, Ah. ,[cake is shown, with two red hearts on the both sides of the of the word ""Home."" SpongeBob sets the icing down. The cake is missing from the tray and SpongeBob gasps. Patrick is next to him eating the cake. His water helmet is sitting on the table. He notices SpongeBob glaring at him, pulls the cake out of his mouth and sets it on the tray. The cake is now in the shape of Texas], Huh? ,[View of the cake. The two red hearts are at the top of the Texas-shaped cake, above the words ""Welcome Home Sandy!"" written in cursive. The 'y' in 'Sandy' curls down to a waving SpongeBob and Patrick decoration. The two smile, SpongeBob has a ""good job"" type smile and Patrick has a reluctant smile. There is another balloon transition to Patrick and SpongeBob pulling ropes to hang a blue ""WELCOME 'DOME' SANDY"" banner in the branches of the tree. A wooden sign points out from the top of the tree that reads ""WE MISSED YOU!"" Balloons are hung in the tree's branches as well as pink banners.], We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be about... ,[He looks at his watch], ...Whoo, right now. ,[The normal submarine-like bus comes down the road, pulls up to Sandy's house and stops. The door opens and Sandy walks out, carrying a suitcase. Patrick and SpongeBob run out from the treedome and stop in front of Sandy. SpongeBob sings], Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya.
,Nat Peterson:, ,[Off-Screen], No! ,[On-Screen], No one wants to hear you sing!
,Sandy:, Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy. ,[bus drives off],
,SpongeBob:, That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy. ,[Sandy giggles. The three go inside the treedome], First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...
,Sandy:, ,[She notices the decorations the two had put up earlier], Wow, guys. You two, uh... ,[she scratches her neck. All but her helmet is off], Really know how to, uh.. ,[scratches her back], Throw a party.
,SpongeBob:, I knew it! You have been itching to see us.
,Sandy:, Well, something's making my skin crawl.
,SpongeBob:, Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide. ,[The scene changes to show the three at the picnic table with cake.], Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return. ,[SpongeBob passes a slice of the cake to Patrick],
,Patrick:, This is gonna taste so good again.
,SpongeBob:, Dig in, Sandy. ,[Sandy is scratching her back with a fork], Uh...
,Sandy:, Looks... Tasty, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[He drops his fork], Are you okay, Sandy?
,Sandy:, I'm fine! My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air. ,[Sandy's fur begins to be pulled out with her scratching, it floats onto SpongeBob's plate and slice of cake. He moves the plate away with his fork, looking disgusted. He looks over to Patrick and sees him combing the hair on his cake, formed into a mustache and hairdo],
,SpongeBob:, Uh.. Hey, Sandy. Sandy. ,[he pokes her back, and holds up a pink box with a red ribbon on it], Surprise! ,[He sets it on the table], Patrick and I chipped in and got ya' a little somethin' somethin'.
,Sandy:, Aww, guys, you shouldn't have. ,[she rips the wrapping and lid off of the box, and lifts up a purple sandboard], A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.
,SpongeBob:, Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?
,Sandy:, Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?
,Sandy:, ,[Still scratching her neck], Rashy sore. I mean, sure.
,SpongeBob:, ,[The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Sandy in there karate gear], Ya ready? ,[Sandy scratches her back with her karate gloves on], And how 'bout now? You ready?
,Sandy:, ,[Sandy gets on the floor and scratches her head like a dog, then gets up and scratches her arm], Creepin' critters, feels like somethin's bitin' me. ,[She looks at her arm closely, her eyes move back and forth, she spots a flea. The flea is biting Sandy's skin. The flea looks up and screeches], I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight. ,[She karate chops her arm], Hi...yah! ,[The flea jumps off Sandy's arm and lands on her leg], I'll get ya. ,[She chops her leg three times and tosses her gloves away. She starts biting her leg. SpongeBob and Patrick stare at her, then look at each other. Sandy scratches her leg and her back with her hands, then turns over to scratch her back. SpongeBob walks over], SpongeBob, my suitcase. Hurry. ,[SpongeBob brings over a blue suitcase. Sandy opens it], I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea. ,[She digs around for something],
,SpongeBob:, What's a flea?
,Sandy:, A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'. ,[Flea jumps off Sandy and lands on SpongeBob's hand. The flea screeches],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], He tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad! ,[flea bites him], Ow! ,[gasps], He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?
,Sandy:, No, but you can use this one right quick. ,[She puts the collar on SpongeBob's wrist. The flea jumps off SpongeBob and lands on Patrick's belly],
,Patrick:, Ow! Ah, Ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah. ,[Breathes heavily and then laughs], Connect the dots. ,[pulls out a pencil and draws lines between the bite marks], I drawed a horsey. ,[we see the ""horse"" he drew for a moment and the flea still bites him], Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?
,Sandy:, 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.
,Patrick:, I've been bit by a vampire flea! ,[He looks up into the air], No! ,[kneels and looks down], I'm gonna turn into a vampire now! ,[lies on the ground and starts pulling out grass], It's already happening! Ah, ah! ,[growls, blows raspberry, his tongue goes around his mouth, then opens and closes mouth and has a squirrel nose],
,Sandy:, Patrick, ,[Patrick's nose disappears], there ain't no such thing as vampires.
,Patrick:, ,[scratches side like a dog], Augh! Doesn't matter! ,[Grabs flea collar off SpongeBob], Oh, this itch is killing me. Yagh! ,[puts the collar on like a belt. The flea jumps off Patrick screeching and lands back on Sandy. She starts scratching],
,Sandy:, Aah! Gimmie that! ,[She takes the collar and puts it on her neck], Phew! ,[The flea jumps back on SpongeBob and goes under his tie],
,SpongeBob:, Nyahh! Oh! Sandy, please help me! ,[Scratches],
,Sandy:, ,[holds onto the collar], I need this!
,SpongeBob:, I need it more! ,[takes the collar and wears it like a belt. The flea jumps of of him and onto Patrick.],
,Patrick:, Eee! ,[He grabs the collar],
,Sandy:, Yah! ,[The flea jumps and goes in Sandy's nose. The flea passes by both eyes and scratches the inside. Sandy screams and takes the collar. They all fight for it and at one point, Patrick throws SpongeBob aside. Sandy is exhausted from scratching. Then the flea lays eggs. The eggs hatch and two fleas emerge screeching. The three fleas jump off of Sandy's head. The Fleas land on SpongeBob and he spins around on the floor scratching], Enough! I will not take this anymore! ,[She wraps the collar around SpongeBob, Patrick, and herself], Whatcha gonna do now, punks? ,[The fleas jump off of them], Looky, it worked. Phew. I'm glad that's over.
,SpongeBob:, Um, is that what over looks like? ,[He points to an increasing amount of fleas],
,Sandy:, Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad! ,[The flea ""pile"" comes over and eats away the flea collar. Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick scream], Run!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Okay! ,[A flea ""cannon"" shoots flea ""cannonballs."" They hit the glass and go back into a pile. The ""cannon"" shoots ""cannonballs"" at the three],
,Patrick:, Wah!
,SpongeBob:, Whoa!
,Sandy:, Hey! ,[""cannonballs"" hit the glass and the flea pile grows bigger], Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla. ,[the flea pile grows even bigger and makes the shape of an ocean wave. The three scream], Run again!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Okay. ,[The flea wave hits the three of them. SpongeBob looks at his arms and they swell with flea bites. Sandy and Patrick swell, too.],
,SpongeBob:, Aah!
,Patrick:, Mraah!
,Sandy:, Aah!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go.
,Patrick:, Yeah, good to see ya. ,[They run toward the door, but a flea tornado beats them there. The tornado then chases after them],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Raah! ,[Squidward is seen walking and listening to some music], Help! Help! Help!
,Squidward:, Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
,Sandy:, Back off! ,[Sandy is squishing the fleas by stepping on them, but they overpower her and run her over. SpongeBob and Patrick rush over],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay? ,[Sandy gets up and spits out fleas],
,Sandy:, Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!
,Patrick:, It's gonna be all right. ,[picks her up], We will help you. ,[Fleas come down like planes. SpongeBob and Patrick scream], Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas, and trouble and pain and itching and a rash! And pain and fleas and itching and... pain! So... much... pain! So much pain. ,[He looks at SpongeBob], And as for you! If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess!
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute! You had as much to do with this party as I did!
,Patrick:, You call this a party? I'm beginning to question ,[He taps on SpongeBob's helmet], our friendship!
,SpongeBob:, Stop smudging my helmet!
,Patrick:, Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy!
,Sandy:, ,[Gets between the two], Would you two men stop yelling at each other?! ,[Pushes them to the ground], What does that prove?! If were gonna get out of this, we gotta work together.
,Patrick:, You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders. ,[SpongeBob does so], Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you...! ,[Straining to get on top of SpongeBob's shoulders. He sits down], Ah... ,[Munches on an apple, then burps], Ahhh... Much better. ,[the ""tower"" topples over], Whoa!
,Sandy:, I do not play games! ,[The fleas assemble to make an evil face, then laugh maniacally. SpongeBob and Patrick hold each other in fright], Quick! In the tree house. It's the only safe place left. ,[Shuts the door behind her], We should be protected here. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick look shocked as the tree house rumbles and shakes and fleas enter through the window], Hold on! ,[Sandy throws an acorn on a button labeled ""Emergency Escape Hatch."" The floor opens and leads them back outside. Fleas start to take over the treedome, and break the picnic table, and start to cover SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy],
,SpongeBob:, Is this how we will spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?
,Sandy:, ,[Her mind pings with an idea], SpongeBob! That's It. Water! ,[She puts on her helmet and karate chops her way to the door. She opens it, and water starts to fill the dome. Patrick and SpongeBob start to cry. Their helmets come off],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Water! ,[Fish are being sucked into the dome],
,SpongeBob:, It sure is good to have you back, Sandy! ,[The episode ends with the ocean empty and all the citizens stuck in Sandy's treedome],

"Mr. Krabs:, ,[Looks around the Krusty Krab with a telescope], Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!
,SpongeBob:, Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait, I saw it first! Hah! ,[Jumps onto table and sweats], Mine, mine! Huh?!
,SpongeBob:, Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
,Mr. Krabs:, What's this? Where are the doubloons?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: ""The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt"".
,Patrick:, Based on a real treasure map.
,SpongeBob:, Take a break and play around with us.
,Patrick:, Yeah! C'mon, sweaty.
,Mr. Krabs:, Have you finished cleaning the tables?
,SpongeBob:, I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
,SpongeBob:, ,[chewing gum], I already took care of it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
,Patrick:, My turn. ,[rolls dice], Five. ,[makes raspberry noise while moving piece. Reads card], One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm. ,[SpongeBob turns his eyes toward Mr. Krabs], It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Patrick, you're fired!
,Patrick:, But I don't even work here!
,Mr. Krabs:, Would you like a job, starting now? ,[puts hat on Patrick's head],
,Patrick:, Boy, would I?!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[takes hat off Patrick's head], You're fired!
,SpongeBob:, My turn. ,[rolls dice], One, two, three, four. ,[picks up card and reads it], Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. ,[looks through the hole in the tree], Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Shiver me timbers!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[rolls dice], Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
,SpongeBob:, ,[picks up card and reads it], You are a real pirate. Go straight to the ""X"" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Treasure. ,[digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears], There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. ,[starts sweating profusely],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
,Fred:, ,[walks into The Krusty Krab], Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one-- ,[Mr. Krabs picks him up, holds him over his head, and heads for the door],  Help! Help! ,[Mr. Krabs throws him out the door], My leg!
,Mr. Krabs:, Can't you see we're closed?! ,[rushes back to the game table], Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hooray!
,Mr. Krabs:, Six! One, two... ,[scenery changes from day to night. SpongeBob and Patrick are tired; Patrick is even asleep on the table], I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
,SpongeBob:, I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. ,[he yawns, slings Patrick over his shoulder, and carries him out], See you tomorrow. ,[walks inside house after taking Patrick home. Rattling noises heard], Huh? Who's there? ,[turns light on],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pushes Mr. Krabs outside], Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. ,[closes door but Mr. Krabs is inside the house once again],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you gotta... ,[opens door, and Mr. Krabs is now outside],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's awful, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs...
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll roll for you, boy.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[rolls dice], Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr...
,Mr. Krabs:, One, two, three...
,SpongeBob:, ,[yelling in fury], ,MR. KRABS!!! ,I WANNA GO TO BED!!!!!, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
,Mr. Krabs:, A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad. ,[SpongeBob shuts the door. Morning arrives], Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
,SpongeBob:, Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
,SpongeBob:, Pirates?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[Patrick appears from the side of SpongeBob's house], Treasure? ,[dancing around], We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. ,[throws them a bag of pirate stuff], Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Walks towards the plank using two peg legs], Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! ,[falls on plank],
,Patrick:, ,[Walks towards the plank with two separate eyepatches covering his eyes], I'm Blind Beard the Pirate. ,[falls on SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Ow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Arrgh! ,[sailing underwater], Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
,SpongeBob:, Really? Can we see the map?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.
,SpongeBob:, Okie dokie, then.
,Mr. Krabs:, Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, ""okie dokie, then."" A pirate says, ""arrgh!""
,SpongeBob:, Okie... oops. ,[laughs while a jellyfish swims by him], I mean... ,[standing up], arrgh! Captain Krabs. ,[eyes widen], Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
,Mr. Krabs:, Out with it man, arrgh!
,Patrick:, I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...! ,[crash], land...
,Mr. Krabs:, ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
,SpongeBob:, The whole ship is underwater captain.
,Mr. Krabs:, Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... ,[Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off], Which way, captain?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ensign Patrick, which way is east?
,Patrick:, Uhh... let's see, uhh... ,[points], that way, captain!
,Mr. Krabs:, 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the ""X""? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.
,Patrick:, Ooh! East? I thought you said ""weast""!
,Mr. Krabs:, Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?
,Patrick:, This one, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. ,[cuts to the crew walking again], 9,551... 9,552...
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
,Patrick:, And hungry.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew... ,[one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears], what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand! ,[cries],
,Patrick:, Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles and crying], Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. ,[both cry],
,Mr. Krabs:, You'll stay with me then?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
,Mr. Krabs:, I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, And all for one! ,[laying on ground at night outside tent],
,SpongeBob:, I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
,Patrick:, I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.
,SpongeBob:, But we've only been gone a few hours.
,Patrick:, I know. ,[laughs. SpongeBob moves away],
,SpongeBob:, I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Captain Krabs?
,SpongeBob:, He's not here.
,Patrick:, Look! The treasure map.
,SpongeBob:, Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Yeah...
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you doing?
,Patrick:, Nothing.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map. ,[Patrick touches the map],
,Patrick:, I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?
,SpongeBob:, No, guess there isn't. ,[Both poking map. Map opens], Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself. ,[Both laugh. Eyes enlarge and search the map],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it. ,[Eyes freeze for a second and then pop back in their heads.],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah?
,Patrick:, Did you notice something familiar about this map?
,SpongeBob:, You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[appearing right behind them], Do you think this is a problem?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[scream], Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?
,Patrick:, We're sorry.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
,SpongeBob:, Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
,Patrick:, I think that.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Look! It's the ""X"".
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[eyes go into ""X"" like symbol], ""X"" marks the spot!
,SpongeBob:, Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
,SpongeBob:, We got it, Captain Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads. Heave! ,[Brings treasure up],
,Mr. Krabs:, We finally found it. ,[opens up the treasure chest],
,Female Singers:, The Dutchman's Treasure.
,All:, Wow!
,SpongeBob:, What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
,Mr. Krabs:, What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
,SpongeBob:, We found it together. So we deserve a share!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
,SpongeBob:, What about loyalty?
,Mr. Krabs:, All for one.
,SpongeBob:, And one for all.
,Mr. Krabs:, All for one.
,SpongeBob:, And one for all.
,Mr. Krabs:, All for one.
,SpongeBob:, And one for all.
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[sleeping], I'm the Flying Dutchman.
,Mr. Krabs:, All for one.
,SpongeBob:, And one for all.
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[sleeping], I'm the Flying Dutchman. ,[wakes up], Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.
,Mr. Krabs:, All for one.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, And one for all. ,[Lightning],
,Flying Dutchman:, Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shoves chest toward SpongeBob and Patrick], They did!
,Flying Dutchman:, Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Uh-huh!
,Flying Dutchman:, Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
,SpongeBob:, Wow!
,Female Singers:, Two Gold Doubloons.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?
,Flying Dutchman:, Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble. ,[Flicks something to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.
,Female Singers:, Plastic!
,Flying Dutchman:, Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest. ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
,[Flying Dutchman turns into green smoke and vanishes.],

"[Transitions to the Krusty Krab, which is surrounded by boats. In his office, Mr. Krabs is checking his money records. He hears shouting from outside],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny. ,[he goes outside and gasps], What the...?! ,[The restaurant is filled with customers shouting angrily], What in Neptune's knickers is this?! ,[A customer grabs him],
,Frank (lifeguard):, Where's the dude in the boat, man? ,Where's the dude in the boat?!,

You mean Mr. Squidward. ,[he turns and points], Well, he's at his post right over the... ,[the wooden boat is empty], Where's me cashier?! ,[He looks down at the Frank, who's still holding his arm. He glares at him, and pulls his arm away. Mr. Krabs bursts into the kitchen], SpongeBob! Where in Poseidon's pantyhoes is that sorry excuse for a cashier?!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry excuse for a cash-?"" Oooooh! You mean Squidward.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs], Yes. I mean Squidward. Where is he?!
,SpongeBob:, He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring... ,[in a whisper], ...complete privacy.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oooooh. He requires, ,privacy, does he? ,[the sound of a chain snapping is heard, followed by a loud crash. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs burst into the storage room], What's all the ruckus?! ,[A shelf has partially collapsed, and there are buns scattered in a heap all over the floor. Squidward emerges from the pile, rubbing his head and groaning. Mr. Krabs gasps], Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible! ,[he bursts into tears], Are you hurt?
,Squidward:, Oh, well. Thank you for ask-
,Mr. Krabs:, I wasn't talking to you! ,[He picks up some of the buns], Don't worry, papa's here. ,[he bursts into tears again],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs? ,[Mr. Krabs continues sobbing], Mr. Krabs! ,[Mr. Krabs sobs even louder], Mr. Krabs! ,[he stops sobbing], Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle! ,[He lifts up his tentacle, which is badly twisted],
,Mr. Krabs:, I didn't even know you had ankles.
,Squidward:, As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job.
,Mr. Krabs:, Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean...
,SpongeBob:, It's all right here, Mr. Krabs.,[Mr. Krabs turns and looks as SpongeBob moves some boxes aside to reveal a poster with ""OWS"" written on it], The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines.
,Mr. Krabs:, Substantial fines?! ,[he turns back to Squidward, laughing nervously], You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know. ,[laughs nervously. Squidward smirks],
,Squidward:, Really? Maybe I should give them a call. ,[picks up a phone],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now now, Squidward! ,[laughs nervously], Let's not be hasty! ,[Squidward puts down the phone], I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally. ,[he turns around], SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid! ,[SpongeBob looks delighted],
,SpongeBob:, First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker, ,[he runs over to Squidward, now wearing a hospital hat and jacket and a stethoscope], for I am certified.
,Squidward:, Oh, no no no, don't touch me! ,[SpongeBob grabs Squidward's nose and runs his stethoscope over it], SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sure. ,[he lets go of Squidward's nose, and it flies back, hitting Squidward],
,Squidward:, Ow! ,[he takes the end of SpongeBob's stethoscope and shouts into the end of it], Get away from me! ,[SpongeBob shakes from the yell and hits his eardrums to make it stop], Well, this is it! I am reporting you to the OWS!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams], Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything at all ya ask.
,Squidward:, Hmm? Anything? ,[cuts to scene where Mr. Krabs lays Squidward down],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now if you want anything, just ask. ,[laughs nervously then walks away],
,Squidward:, I could sure use a pillow. ,[Mr. Krabs comes back to Squidward with a pillow. He places the pillow on Squidward's back],
,Squidward:, And one more for my foot.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, sure thing. ,[comes back with another pillow which is placed under Squidward's twisted foot], Okay, if that's all, I'll just get back to me--
,Squidward:, Fluff it.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[angered], What did you say?
,Squidward:, I said, ""fluff it.""
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[mocking tone], Fluff my pillow, I'll fluff your pillow. ,[Krabs angrily fluffs the pillow for Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[angered], What's that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, uh, I said, uh, will there be anything else, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[relaxes on his pillow], No thanks. That should do it. ,[Krabs walks away], Oh, Krabsy!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[irritated tone], What can I do for you?
,Squidward:, Just one more thing. I'm afraid you'll have to take over for me today.
,Mr. Krabs:, What!? Nooo!
,Squidward:, Oh, that's too bad. It looks like my twisted ankle might become a 'permanent injury.'
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cringes], Well, that would be an even bigger fine. You just sit back down and relax. We don't want you being injured any further. ,[chuckles nervously, then walks away], That was close. Well, at least the Krusty Krab isn't very busy today. ,[anchovies meep], Of course. ,[cuts to scene where SpongeBob holds a clipboard.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs, I have the OWS accident report form to fill out. Let's see, Question 1: Was the accident the result of criminal negligence? ,[Mr. Krabs screams], Mr. Krabs, what is criminal negligence?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[takes the clipboard from SpongeBob], It's what criminals wear to bed. Don't worry about that. We don't need to bother those nice folks over at the OWS. We can do our own investigation. 
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you mean we should find out if you're criminally negligent.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, no, not exactly, what I mean is... ,[leans towards SpongeBob and whispers], I think Mr. Squidward is hiding something, and I want you to investigate.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs...
,Mr. Krabs:, Shhhh. ,[whispering], You gotta keep it a secret from Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, Can do, Mr. Krabs.
,[Cuts to scene where SpongeBob tries to figure out the cause of the accident],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm? Huh? If I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, I'm gonna need some help. ,[Cuts to scene where Patrick is shown], Okay, you stand here... ,[places Patrick next to the shelf, then places a few buns on top], Now, pretend you're Squidward and reach for a bun. ,[Patrick does so], And I'll simulate the shelf hitting Squidward. ,[slams the shelf into Patrick, who screams and stumbles around, dizzy, before falling over], Hmm, we seem to be missing something. Well, we'll have to do it again.
,Patrick:, Uhh, do what again? ,[cut to outside of the scene], Ow!
,SpongeBob:, Darn, one more time.
,Patrick:, Ow! ,[cuts to scene where Squidward relaxes on Krusty Krab roof. Mr. Krabs comes to the roof with a tea kit in his hand],
,Squidward:, Oh, Krabsy, after tea, I think a full tentacle massage would be an order.
,Mr. Krabs:, I ain't touching your tentacles with a 10-ft...
,Squidward:, ,[on phone], Hello, Office Workers Safety Department....,[Mr. Krabs jumps at Squidward ripping the phone out of his hand, then eats it.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles nervously], I'll go get the massage oil now. ,[runs inside; cut to the storage room], Boy, ya got anything?
,SpongeBob:, Not yet, Mr. Krabs. ,[Mr. Krabs  groans; takes a bucket of fry grease],
,Squidward:, ,[clearing throat], I'm waiting!
,Mr. Krabs:, Coming!
,SpongeBob:, This just isn't adding up.
,Patrick:, ,[sits up], Pudding?
,SpongeBob:, We must be missing something. Patrick, we're going to need help even more expert than you. ,[cut to inside the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs massages Squidward's tentacles using the fry grease],
,Frankie Billy:,  Um, hello? Anybody here?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[angered, muttering], Oh, for the love of peat moss.
,Frankie Billy:, Anybody at all? Hmm, maybe they're on their lunch bre-- ,[Mr. Krabs reaches into Frankie Billy's pocket, pulling out the money, walks into the kitchen to prepare a Krabby Patty, then comes out to present a Patty covered in fry grease],
,Frankie Billy:, Um, aren't you gonna wash your...... ,[Mr. Krabs shoves the greasy Krabby Patty into Frankie Billy's mouth; Frankie Billy groans in pain as he holds his stomach. Krabs returns to pampering Squidward by continuing to massage his tentacles],
,Mr. Krabs:, How long do I have to keep this up?
,Squidward:, Oh, it's gonna be a long, slow recovery. Time to pop my back barnacles. ,[Mr. Krabs screams as Squidward's back barnacles are shown and then he cries. The customers mutter in anger],
,OWS Manager:, Office Workers Safety Department. I'm here to investigate the accident.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Oh, no!
,Squidward:, ,[sitting up], Oh, yes!
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, after all I've done for you, you've called the OWS!
,SpongeBob:, He didn't call them, Mr. Krabs, we did. I needed help investigating the accident. Right, buddy?
,Patrick:, Uh, breakfast, green, Finland. 
,Squidward:, Well I, for one, plan to give him my full cooperation. ,[seen in a wheelchair with casts around his head, his arm, and one of his legs], Anything I can do, inspector? ,[smiles at Mr. Krabs, who fumes with anger; cuts to scene where they all investigate the accident],
,OWS Manager:, So, this is where the accident occurred. Can anyone tell me what happened?
,Squidward:, I'll be glad to... ,[in despair], I mean, I can re-live the whole tragic episode, if I must. ,[struggles to get up from the wheelchair], It was just another day at the Krusty Krab. I was at the register, giving it a nice shining between orders, when something caught my eye; a patty bun with 10 seeds, instead of 11. I wasn't about to stand idly by and allow a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and vitamins. ""I must replace it with a proper bun!"", I said. I dashed into action.
,Squidward:, Excuse me, sir.
,Frankie Billy:, What a diligent and charming individual.
,Squidward:, Thats when I entered the back room to grab a new bun. Just as I was about to reach for one, I heard a slight creek, and that's when the chain snapped, and then, slam! My heroic and brave actions were halted by an unsafe shelf. Disoriented and in pain, I collapsed, and lay for nearly six hours crying softly for help. ,[crying], Help! H-help! Help.  The worst part, though, is...is that I didn't get that kind gentleman his new bun.
,OWS Manager:, Hmmm, I see. As you know, certain penalties are involved...
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no...
,OWS Manager:, ,[types in random numbers while Mr. Krabs cries], One... Dollar!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps, blinking, wild sobbing, train bell dings], Noooooo! Why?! Why, why?! Huh? ,[scene zooms out to reveal a surveillance camera], What's this? Hold on a second. Me video surveillance camera!
,Squidward:, ,[shocked], What?!
,Mr. Krabs:, I forgot. I, uh, um, borrowed that from the airport. Now, let's see what really happened here. ,[Mr. Krabs comes back with the recording tape and the TV from the surveillance. Squidward is seen walking towards the bun shelf, but what he does is sleep on it. The chain immediately breaks and Squidward falls unharmed under the buns. Mr. Krabs gasps, then turns to Squidward furiously.], You... f-f-f-f-f-faker! Not to mention you were sleeping on the job! ,[sighs deeply, forcing Squidward to the ground],
,Squidward:, What are you going to do to me?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm gonna make you pay.
,Squidward:, Oh, no! ,[cuts to scene where Krabs gets pampered. Krabs sighs. Squidward gasps. When Squidward starts to pop some of the barnacles on Mr. Krabs back, he screams in sorrow.],

"Squidward:, Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. ,[wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices], And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!
,Janitor:, Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.
,Squidward:, Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer. ,[opens door], Welcome to art class!
,Nat:, Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry. ,[everyone leaves except SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? In art class? Wait! This is cooking! Come back! You gotta be kidding.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
,Squidward:, You're looking at him.
,SpongeBob:, You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
,Squidward:, Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
,Squidward:, So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, please.
,Squidward:, Well, art is not all fun and games. ,[as he picks up a big stack of books], It's a lot of hard... ,[he drops the stack, which makes SpongeBob's desk hop in the air], ...work. OK. First, repeat after me: I have no talent.
,SpongeBob:, I have no talent.
,Squidward:, Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
,Squidward:, If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacles talent will rub off on me.
,SpongeBob:, If I'm lucky,  Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. ,[smiles. The scene cuts to Squidward with a sad look on his face, the camera cuts back to SpongeBob and he is still smiling, the camera again cuts back to Squidward],
,Squidward:, Whatever. Ok. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say circle one. ,[draws a crooked circle, then laughs], Am I going too fast for you SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, How's this, Squidward?
,Squidward:, What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
,SpongeBob:, Well, first I draw this head. ,[draws an amazing head], Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
,Squidward:, Gimme that. ,[crumples paper], Forget the circles.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try. ,[laughs], Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom.
,Squidward:, Gimme that. ,[rips up paper], There is nothing artistic about leapfrog! ,[SpongeBob puts pieces together], What are you doing, now?
,SpongeBob:, I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time. ,[blows paper],
,Squidward:, Do you want to learn art, or not?
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
,Squidward:, Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. And... ,[hits marble with chisel; and it breaks into a pile of rubble],
,SpongeBob:, ,[hits marble with chisel and it becomes a perfect sculpture of Michelangelo's David], How's this Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[starry-eyed], It's beautiful! ,[a tear falls from his eyes], I mean... this isn't a sculpture. ,[SpongeBob's lip starts quivering], A good sculpture takes... more time. You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules. ,[SpongeBob wipes away a tear], Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong. ,[Squidward puts a nose like his on the sculpture], There, now it's art.
,SpongeBob:, Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons. ,[falls down and starts crying], I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence. ,[crawls over to the front door and looks back at Squidward], I don't even deserve to use your doors! ,[the doors open, hitting SpongeBob out the window into the garbage dumpster head-first],
,Monty:, Hello, there.
,SpongeBob:, But I did deserve that. ,[the dumpster closes on top of him], I deserved that, too. ,[garbage man takes SpongeBob to dump], And I deserve this!
,Monty:, Good day, sir.
,Squidward:, Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.
,Monty:, Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.
,Squidward:, The world famous art collector?
,Monty:, The one and only.
,Squidward:, Well, what are you doing here?
,Monty:, I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.
,Squidward:, Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: ""Squidward en repose"".
,Monty:, I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.
,Squidward:, Why not?
,Monty:, Because, it's an art collection. ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.
,Monty:, More like: Belongs in the Trash. ,[laughs],
,Janitor:, Sorry. I must've missed that one. ,[grabs the painting and throws it in the trash],
,Monty:, Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?
,Squidward:, Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...
,Monty:, Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship. This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw. ,[removes the nose Squidward added on and it lands on Squidward's head], Ah, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame.
,Squidward:, Fame. ,[Squidward imagines himself as popular],
,Monty:, Fortune.
,Squidward:, Fortune. ,[Squidward imagines himself in a tub full of money],
,Monty:, Anything his heart desires.
,Squidward:, Anything? ,[Squidward imagines himself with hair], It's me. It's me. I'm responsible.
,Monty:, I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.
,Squidward:, I could use a little help. ,[sculptures head falls off and turns into dust], My fame! My fortune! My hair!
,Monty:, Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.
,Squidward:, Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.
,Monty:, Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks. ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. ,[closes the door as Monty walks out], I gotta find SpongeBob! ,[at dump], SpongeBob...SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
,Squidward:, Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.
,SpongeBob:, Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame. ,[he slides out of the cereal box], These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them. ,[SpongeBob's hands pop off and run into a soup can],
,Squidward:, Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Squidward:, Really!
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Squidward:, Really!
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Squidward:, Really.
,SpongeBob:, Wow. ,[pause], Really?
,Squidward:, Let's go.
,SpongeBob:, ,[notices a painting in the dump], Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
,Squidward:, Gimme that. ,[back at classroom], Ok, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.
,SpongeBob:, I... can't!
,Squidward:, Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again.
,SpongeBob:, I did it, Squidward. ,[draws a crooked circle],
,Squidward:, Huh? But, but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
,Squidward:, Uhh... ,[crumples paper], How about this, huh? Remember?
,SpongeBob:, That's not in the book, either.
,Squidward:, Forget about the book! ,[rips book], Ha! Look at all this mess SpongeBob. ,[he grabs a chair, puts it in front of SpongeBob's desk, and jumps up and down while holding it], What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?
,SpongeBob:, Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it. ,[puts book back together], Ta-da! ,[Squidward's nose melts off his face],
,Squidward:, OK, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.
,SpongeBob:, First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
,Squidward:, Now you've got it.
,SpongeBob:, I've gotta embrace the marble!
,Squidward:, Right.
,SpongeBob:, I've gotta sniff the marble!
,Squidward:, Well, uh, ok.
,SpongeBob:, I've gotta lick the marble!
,Squidward:, Uhh...
,SpongeBob:, ,[washes the marble in a washing machine], I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble! ,[expands himself so that he's the same size as the marble], I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
,Squidward:, Here you go, buddy. ,[hands him sculpting tools],
,SpongeBob:, With this tool, I shall give birth to art.
,Squidward:, Oh, boy. ,[SpongeBob taps marble with the chisel; it shatters into a pile of rubble],
,SpongeBob:, But, one more thing. ,[puts a stone nose shaped like Squidward's on it], There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in. ,[Squidward screams with frustration and goes crazy, runs though the marble and kicks two marbles, eating a part of the marble, he takes paint, squeezes it, kicks a picture, destroys the marble into 4 pieces and destroys the other marbles], It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump. ,[runs through the wall and down the road singing in the tune of the William Tell Overture],  ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump. ♪
,Monty:, I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?
,Squidward:, As of now, it's his responsibility! ,[puts hat on janitor's head], Good day to you, sir! ,[it is revealed that when Squidward smashed all of the marble together, he created an even better sculpture than the first one and left without even seeing it],
,Monty:, ,[to janitor], You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!

,SpongeBob:, Oh, dear Neptune.
,Squidward:, Oh, boy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts his spatula under the meat], We can do this. At the count of 3, we flip. Ready? 1, 2, 3. ,[Attempts to flip; spatula breaks in half], Spat?
,[SpongeBob screams and cries in front of everyone while showing his spatula that is broken. The scene cuts to SpongeBob to a therapist],
,Therapist:, Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on. ,[SpongeBob cries once more.],
,[SpongeBob is on a cliff, still crying. Patrick comes up and joins in crying. Switches to an ambulance taking Spatula away, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob quietly watch],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, we better get back to work.
,SpongeBob:, Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Use another spatular.
,SpongeBob:, ,[close-up of his face, his eyes are hypno like], ,WHAT?!, There is only ,1, spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat! ,[runs off to the hospital], I'm coming, Spat!
,[scene cuts to hospital where SpongeBob is by a spatula's bed],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.
,[SpongeBob flashes back to all the good times he had with his spatula: flipping patties, laying in the sun with spatula, scratching his back with spatula, playing ping pong with his spatula, reaching under the chair for the remote with spatula, and playing pirates with spatula],
,Doctor:, There’s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.
,[SpongeBob turns around and starts to cry, then turns back around],
,Doctor:, Go home. Get some rest. We’ll try to do everything we can.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, Doctor.
,Doctor:, Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who’s searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part. ,[gives a sigh of relief],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gives a kiss to the spatula and walks out of the hospital], Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! ,[notices a sign that says ""LE SPATULA INSIDE"" and a picture of a high-tech spatula is on it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Thinks], Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this. ,[walks off then reappears inside the shop in front of the spatula. Thinks], Maybe I do need this. ,[his eyes are shaped as a spatula],
,Doctor:, ,[in SpongeBob's thought bubble], I would give serious consideration to... ,[bell gongs], a replacement spatula.
,[SpongeBob slowly reaches for the spatula, but his hand is slapped away by 1 of the employees],
,SpongeBob:, OW!
,Employee:, Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive.
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry.
,Employee:, Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it.
,SpongeBob:, I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it? ,[takes out a bunch of money],
,Employee:, Umm... ,[takes out a calculator and punches in many numbers], ...no.

,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street nude where everyone is looking at him in shock],
,SpongeBob:, Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking? ,[walks into the Krusty Krab, passes Squidward], Ooh, breezy today.
,Squidward:, ,[Snickers], Nice outfit, SpongeBob! ,[laughs hysterically],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.
,Mr. Krabs:, What’s all the lallygagging about?
,Squidward:, ,[still laughing], Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.

,SpongeBob:, All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs. ,[shows Le Spatula],
,Mr. Krabs:, Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma. ,[Le Spatula glows],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, what can it do?
,Squidward:, Can it make me famous?
,SpongeBob:, Anything you want and more. ,[pushes a button and the spatula spins],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it. ,[Reaches for Le Spatula],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Holds Le Spatula away from Mr. Krabs' reach], Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shocked], What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
,SpongeBob:, No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.
,Mr. Krabs:, With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... ,[pushes a button and a bunch of spatulas appear],
,Le Spatula:, ,[says mechanically], Le Spatula 3000 at your service!
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket. ,[laughs and walks away with Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy? ,[all the spatulas go into hiding], Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job. ,[scene cuts to outside the kitchen],
,Martin:, Uh, can I get 1 Krabby Patty, please?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I need 1 Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, ,[back in the kitchen], 1 Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split. ,[tries to use Le Spatula, but every time he tries to flip the patty, the spatula goes another direction], Spat, is there something wrong, pal?
,Le Spatula:, I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!
,SpongeBob:, But, but, I thought we were friends.
,Le Spatula:, Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class. ,[jumps out of SpongeBob's arms and extends it legs to land on the floor], Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook! ,[runs out laughing],
,SpongeBob:, Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. ,[Le Spatula punches SpongeBob in the face],
,Le Spatula:, How’s that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon. ,[spits and runs out],
,Mr. Krabs:, What happened?
,SpongeBob:, Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr Krabs:, Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!
,SpongeBob:, I had a spatula once. A real spatula. 1 that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!
,Mr. Krabs:, I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.
,Mr. Krabs:, Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers. ,[starts to cry; scene cuts to the spatula's hospital bed from the start of the episode, with the pulse meter slowing, then becomes a flat line],
,SpongeBob:, Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late! ,[cries],
,Doctor:, SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this...
,SpongeBob:, I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone! ,[sobs],
,Doctor:, Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm so sorry. ,[cries more],
,Doctor:, Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary. ,[scene pans over to the Infirmary where Spat is in a wheelchair],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Spatula! ,[runs into the infirmary], Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better! ,[Spat turns around and ignores SpongeBob], Spatula, what's wrong? ,[spatula shakes its head], But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?! ,[begins burst into tears loudly and rolls. As he is doing this, another SpongeBob comes up into the scene],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in a monotone voice], : All that glitters is not gold. ,[as SpongeBob is still crying loudly, spatula wheels itself away],
,SpongeBob:, Goodbye, best friend!
,[SpongeBob crawls crying all the way to the Krusty Krab kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, I'll never find another spatula like him again. ,[notices a spatula flipping patties by itself], Spatula? You're back! ,[SpongeBob jumps for spatula in slow motion, camera cuts to outer space], Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.
,Squidward:, 1 monster Krabby Patty. ,[the same real set of hands put a bunch of meat on the grill as before],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? 1, 2, 3. ,[SpongeBob's arms come off], D'oh! ,[laughs],

I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me! ,[camera zooms out to show the Krusty Krab filled with paper mâché SpongeBobs], So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?
,Squidward:, You don't seem to understand. ,[starts to get angry], I... don't... want... a... happiest memory! ,[starts to go crazy and destroys the cake],
,SpongeBob:, ,[talking to a paper mâché SpongeBob] ,So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?
,Squidward:, ,[rips the paper mâché SpongeBob apart then saws more apart; then crawls to the ceiling and grabs the banner that says ""Happy Happiest Memory Squidward"" and kicks more of them away], I feel wonderful! ,[Laughs maniacally and destroys more paper mâché SpongeBobs], This is it, my happiest memory!
,SpongeBob:, Sigh... he's so handsome!

"[Inside his pineapple house, SpongeBob is laying in bed snoring. His foghorn alarm sounds and he wakes up immediately; he inhales deeply, then sighs and opens his window curtains],
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, day! ,[he begins to walk, but accidentally steps on the top of his big toe], Oww! ,[falls over, but gets back up with his toe sore], I stubbed my toe! ,[he cries profusely, and continuously like a fountain, leaving a puddle surrounding him], I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe! ,[later, he walks into his closet and searches though a long line of identical SquarePants while humming; he picks one, but the wire hanger rips through the side], D'oh, that was my favorite shirt. ,[cries; later, he appears at his breakfast table eating oatmeal while listening to the radio],
,Radio DJ:, And that was ""Aja"" by Eely Dan. Next up is Lionel Fishy with his hit, ""Sad Song"".
,[The sad song begins to play, and SpongeBob begins to cry again.],
,SpongeBob:, That's a sad song!
,Squidward:, ,[inside his house, wearing a robe and towel, while holding a cup of tea and a danish], That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. Lucky me, I get to work with him all day. ,[he takes a bite out of his danish while SpongeBob continues to cry from inside his house; later, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is flipping Krabby Patties while singing],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[enters abruptly, startling SpongeBob, who flips the patty into the air], SpongeBob, guess what? ,[the patty lands on the ground], Yeah, I'll come back later. ,[goes back into his office, SpongeBob sadly picks the patty up by his spatula and carries it to the trash can],
,SpongeBob:, He was a good little Krabby Patty. ,[sniffs], I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I--,[opens the trash lid and begins crying],--I came to love him! ,[the patty slowly slides off his spatula and into the trash bin], It just isn't fair! ,[he cries even louder, soaking and enraging Squidward from the counter window],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!
,SpongeBob:, But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he—
,Squidward:, Krabby Patty nothing! ,[SpongeBob tries to speak again, but Squidward interrupts him very loudly], Krabby Patty nothing! ,[he pants heavily, then SpongeBob whimpers with tears], What now?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stifled], You yelled at me! You yelled at me! ,[sobs loudly, continuing to soak Squidward with tears while Squidward gives himself a depressed look on his face, realizing yelling isn't going to help],
,Squidward:, All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times.
,SpongeBob:, And you wrote that number on a chalkboard.
,Squidward:, Yes!
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Squidward:, ,[pauses for a second], I have no idea.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain.
,Squidward:, Au contraire. ,[turns on a TV],
,SpongeBob:, What's this?
,Squidward:, It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years.
,[the video begins to play, showing SpongeBob crying in the Krusty Krab, in a grocery store, at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, in Jellyfish Fields, in the bathroom, and more like near a bus stop for no reason],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in the video], Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Sob. Whimper.
,Narrator:, Thousands of tears later...
,[SpongeBob continues to watch himself crying in the video],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore.
,Squidward:, Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying.
,SpongeBob:, ,[realizes something], Excuse me a minute. ,[he walks up to a rotary telephone and dials it, Patrick appears lazily sitting on his couch when his own phone rings],
,Patrick:, ,[answers it], Star... residence. Patrick speaking.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy! Is it 7:30 already?
,SpongeBob:, No, I'm still at work.
,Patrick:, How can I help you?
,SpongeBob:, Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?
,Patrick:, ,[mouth full with popcorn], Well, of course you can.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, great, thanks, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is.
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah. ,[laughs with his mouth full], Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there.
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Okay.
,Patrick:, Yeah, talk to you later.
,SpongeBob:, All right, see ya. ,[hangs up, then walks back up to Squidward], Okay, it's a bet.
,Squidward:, ,[shakes SpongeBob's hand], Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to... ,[thinks], Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year.
,SpongeBob:, Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me. ,[Squidward retches and swallows], Ooh, what's the matter?
,Squidward:, Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth. ,[begins talking in his thoughts], No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes. ,[laughs out loud; in the evening, he and SpongeBob are now walking home from work],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward.
,Squidward:, There's a first time for everything. ,[under his breath], Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible. ,[chuckles devilishly],
,SpongeBob:, ,[speaking in his thoughts], I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry. ,[straining, he speaks out loud], I can do this.
,Squidward:, ,[smiling], Do what? ,[sees something and gasps], Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob looks at the sunset and gasps], Isn't that beautiful?
,SpongeBob:, I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset.
,Squidward:, Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps quietly in awe], It's... ,[the Bikini Bottom Choir drives by singing an angelic note, Squidward chuckles as SpongeBob's eyes begin to twinkle and water],
,Squidward:, Is that a tear I see? ,[the sunset disappears],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, well, sunset's over. ,[walks off, Squidward scoffs in frustration; later, they both enter SpongeBob's house], Nice of you to drop in, neighbor.
,Squidward:, Nice of you to have me, I--,[sees something], Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping.
,[Gary appears on a stack of newspapers sleeping, snoring and meowing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[with his hands together, up to his mouth], Aww. He looks like an angel.
,Squidward:, That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry.
,[Gary begins to drool in his sleep],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. ,[snaps out of it], No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight! ,[walks off into the kitchen], La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
,[the mail comes in through the mail slot in SpongeBob's door],
,Squidward:, Oh, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pouring drinks], Yes?
,Squidward:, Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around], Mother, father?
,Squidward:, ,[reading the postcard], ""Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much.
,SpongeBob:, ,[teary-eyed at first], Ohh. ,[grabs another postcard], My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[with spite], No problem.
,[Later on, SpongeBob and Squidward sit on the couch watching the news],
,Anchor Fish:, Welcome back to Bikini Bottom News. Our top story tonight: a series of sad tales.
,Squidward:, Ooh, let's turn it up.
,Anchor Fish:, Tragedy in the park when a young snail caught in a tree almost didn't get down.
,Petey:, ,[stuck on a coral tree branch], Meow.
,[SpongeBob gasps and gets ready to cry],
,Anchor Fish:, However, he did get down.
,SpongeBob:, ,[raising his arms], Hooray!
,Anchor Fish:, Coming up, an interview with a manatee who didn't get what he wanted for his birthday.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sad again], Oh, no.
,Anchor Fish:, And finally, sad news for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fans.
,[Squidward excitedly raises up the volume],
,SpongeBob:, ,[voice breaks], What, what, what?
,Anchor Fish:, They will only be showing The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Show seven times a day instead of eight—
,SpongeBob:, ,[sweating, changes the channel], Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?
,Squidward:, Fine!
,[the channel changes to a show where a dad fish is walking out of his house for work while a kid fish plays with a baseball in the yard],
,Kid Fish:, Hey, Dad, how about a game of catch? ,[he throws the baseball in front of his bored dad],
,Unnamed father:, Sorry, son, I'm late for work.
,Kid Fish:, ,[disappointedly], Okay, Dad. ,[his dad throws the baseball back],
,Unnamed father:, ,[tosses his briefcase], I guess I can stay for a few throws.
,Kid Fish:, ,[teary-eyed], I love you, Dad.
,Unnamed father:, ,[teary-eyed], I love you, son.
,[the show ends with the two happily playing catch, SpongeBob turns the TV off and madly throws it out of his window, then walks back to the couch panting],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to Squidward], You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain.
,Patrick:, ,[from outside], Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob. ,[he carries the broken-up TV set on his head], I'm gonna watch it all night! ,[he runs into his rock house with it. SpongeBob and Squidward awkwardly stare at each other, Squidward glances at the cuckoo clock, which says 8:41, then speaks in his thoughts],
,Squidward:, It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns. ,[out loud], Oh, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Squidward?
,Squidward:, What would you say to a little music? ,[pulls out his clarinet],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps happily], I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments. ,[walks off],
,Squidward:, Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting. ,[gets out sheet music titled ""Hearts & Flowers (or Some Such Sad Song)"", then chuckles],
,SpongeBob:, ,[appears, holding a tray of tea], You said something, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Oh, I just said, ""Relax and enjoy the song."" ,[he begins playing the such sad song on his clarinet, SpongeBob goes stifled, trying to fight back tears, Squidward strains hard playing the last single note, then pants],
,SpongeBob:, That's a really sad song, Squidward.
,Squidward:, You're not gonna cry though, are you?
,SpongeBob:, No. ,[Squidward growls, the scallop cuckoo clock then chirps 9:00], Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed. ,[starts to put the tray of tea down],
,Squidward:, ,[nervously], Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Squidward?
,Squidward:, How about a bedtime story?
,SpongeBob:, Now you're talking! ,[later in his room, he lays in bed with Squidward], Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Umm... ,[nervously searches through the pages], How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?
,SpongeBob:, That sounds like a very sad story.
,Squidward:, Oh, very sad. Umm... ""There once was a little angler ,[the page he's reading is actually of the story Jack and Jill], who was, uh, little and sad. ,[SpongeBob whimpers], One day the little sad angler was walking through the park. ,[SpongeBob begins to chuckle with joy],
,SpongeBob:, Walking...
,Squidward:, But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he— he started to cry. ,[SpongeBob begins to choke up], He cried and he cried. And he cried even more. ,[SpongeBob shakes with sadness], And he kept crying... ,[SpongeBob strains and forces back tears], ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it.
,SpongeBob:, I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward.
,Squidward:, You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel--,[the second hand on the clock ticks closer to midnight], Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on! ,[the dam inside SpongeBob's brain begins to crack], ...four, three, two, one! ,[the dam breaks, and a river of tears begins to rush out], Midnight! ,[sighs, SpongeBob's body is turning wide], Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the... ,[SpongeBob's eyes burst with tears, shooting a flood towards Squidward and smacking him against the wall. The tears shoot out the windows, door crack, chimney, and other holes in his house. They spread to Patrick's house, causing an entire waterfall inside],
,Patrick:, Wow, what a great show.
,[The tears flood the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[standing on his desk, holding a fat stack of money away from the tears], Well, at least we're still together, little ones.
,[The Bikini Bottom Choir drives through the flood holding the angelic note; at SpongeBob's house, the tears continue to spray into Squidward's face, then stop; the cuckoo scallop hits him on the head. Now, SpongeBob and Squidward sit in front of the TV],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding out a bowl of popcorn], More popcorn, Squidward?
,Squidward:, No, no. No, no. Please.
,SpongeBob:, ,[eating popcorn], Don't be shy now. I made extra. ,[Squidward begins to whimper, SpongeBob rubs his shoulders], That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here.
,[Squidward whimpers even harder, then starts bawling hysterically],

"Narrator:, Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. ,[chuckles], Well, you know. ,[Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy],
,Patrick:, An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. ,[arrow on top of rock breaks], Jellyfish, I got an award. ,[jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface], Island, I got an awar... ,[chokes for air and floats back down], I gotta show SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[building a house of cards looking like Gary], Hold still, Gary.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Almost done. ,[Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.,[SpongeBob falls down to the floor],
,SpongeBob:, That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
,Patrick:, See for yourself.
,SpongeBob:, ,[his body is facedown but his face come out and reads the award], ""For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?""
,Patrick:, SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
,Patrick:, But, it's shiny. ,[SpongeBob takes the trophy],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
,Patrick:, Ice cream!
,SpongeBob:, Exactly!
,Patrick:, I can find it. Is it in here?
,SpongeBob:, No, don't! That's my... ,[Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet], ...award closet.
,Patrick:, I want an award! ,[starts to cry],
,SpongeBob:, ,[has two 1st place ribbons in his eyes], Aww, Patrick, don't cry. ,[Patrick starts sobbing loudly and wildly going away from the awards], You'll get an award one day.
,Patrick:, I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.
,SpongeBob:, But you're Patrick... ,[jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars], Star. You can do anything you want.
,Patrick:, That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
,Patrick:, Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
,SpongeBob:, Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
,Patrick:, I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
,SpongeBob:, Smaller. ,[shrinks],
,Patrick:, Doctor?
,SpongeBob:, Smaller. ,[shrinks more],
,Patrick:, Fireman?
,SpongeBob:, ,[In a tiny voice], The smallest you can think of. ,[shrinks even more],
,Patrick:, A job at the Krusty Krab?
,SpongeBob:, ,[normal voice], Yeah! ,[grows to normal size], I do things at work all the time.
,Patrick:, Then let's go. ,[Patrick runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm],
,Patrick:, Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
,SpongeBob:, And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
,Squidward:, Guess who just quit? ,[puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves],
,Patrick:, Do I get my award yet?
,SpongeBob:, You have to work for it, remember?
,Patrick:, Tartar sauce. ,[SpongeBob flipping patties],
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob places the order in the window], Pick up order! ,[Patrick comes and eats the order],
,Patrick:, Do I get my award, now?
,SpongeBob:, No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
,Patrick:, Ok. ,[tray gets to table but with no food; Patrick burps],
,SpongeBob:, Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. ,[Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down],
,Patrick:, Like that?
,SpongeBob:, Nope.
,Patrick:, ,[spits out food at the customer as he talks], Barnacles!
,SpongeBob:, Let's try something different.
,SpongeBob:, All you have to do is answer the phone.
,Patrick:, Aye aye, Captain! ,[phone rings],
,Guy on Phone:, Is this the Krusty Krab?
,Patrick:, No, this is Patrick. ,[hangs up and starts whistling; phone rings again],
,Girl on Phone:, Is this the Krusty Krab?
,Patrick:, ,[annoyed], No! This is Patrick! ,[hangs up and continues to whistle; phone rings yet again],
,Another Guy on Phone:, Is this the Krusty Krab?
,Patrick:, ,[infuriated], No! This is Patrick! ,[puts phone down and folds his arms], I'm not a Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
,Patrick:, Huh? Oh, Fishpaste!
,SpongeBob:, It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? ,[hands Patrick a broom],
,Patrick:, What's the point? I can't do anything right.
,SpongeBob:, You'll do fine. ,[Patrick sweeps with the top side of the broom instead of the bottom],
,Nat:, ,[approaches Patrick], Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? ,[continues drinking],
,SpongeBob:, Keep trying, Patrick.
,Delivery Guy:, I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. ,[Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder],
,Patrick:, Why can't I do anything right?! ,[bangs the bottom of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers start coughing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[pushing Patrick], Kitchen!
,Patrick:, ,[throws the broom to the floor], I'm never gonna get an award, now.
,SpongeBob:, Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. ,[gets a jar and opens the lid], Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. ,[Patrick gets out a pickle], Patrick, that's a pickle.
,Patrick:, Yes.
,SpongeBob:, You need a jar. ,[Patrick picks up a spatula], No. ,[Patrick takes his pants off], No. ,[Patrick picks up SpongeBob], No. Try...this! ,[gives Patrick a jar], Now take the lid off the jar. ,[puts the lid in his mouth], Just relax. Lift your hand. ,[Patrick lifts his hand], Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. ,[puts his hand on counter], No, the lid. ,[slides his hand to the corner of the counter], ,[Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him ""the lid"", Patrick pants due to exhaustion; few seconds later, Patrick is almost there], Freeze! ,[hand is on the side of the jar], Almost there. Now head for the lid. ,[hand goes lower], Cold. ,[hand goes higher], Warmer. ,[hand goes higher], Warmer. ,[hand goes higher], Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
,Patrick:, Ow, it burns!
,SpongeBob:, Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. ,[takes it off again], Exactly as I do. ,[takes it off again], Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
,Patrick:, Exactly as you do., [takes lid off jar, then starts to cry], Oh, no, I broke it!
,SpongeBob:, No, no, Patrick, you did it!
,Patrick:, I did? ,[both cheer as Patrick throws the jar onto the floor], Touchdown! I'm jarmaster!
,SpongeBob:, That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah.
,Patrick:, Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Yeah.
,Patrick:, But I didn't. I opened the jar with my hand. And it was all because you showed me how to do it. I'm never gonna forget this.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time. ,[night becomes day in SpongeBob's house then clam crows everyone up], I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. ,[notices Patrick dressed up like him],
,Patrick:, Good morning, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.
,Patrick:, Yup. If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one.
,SpongeBob:, That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... ,[Patrick copies SpongeBob then SpongeBob stops], Huh?
,SpongeBob:, Well, back to the ol' grind.
,Patrick:, Well, back to the ol' grind.
,SpongeBob:, Forget my hat.
,Patrick:, Uh, me, too.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up; Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet; SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all; Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps; SpongeBob glares at him],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads], Whew! ,[SpongeBob drops his spatula],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Dropped my spatula. ,[bends down to pick it up],
,Patrick:, Uhh, me, too. ,[drops spatula and bends down to pick it up; SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on, then they both put their hands on the grill; Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds], Ow!
,SpongeBob:, Aha! ,[shows the fake hand], You're copying me!
,Patrick:, Yes.
,SpongeBob:, Why are you doing that?
,Patrick:, So I can win an award like you.
,SpongeBob:, Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
,Patrick:, Stop it. ,[both imitate the others facial expressions],
,SpongeBob:, Say, you're good.
,Patrick:, Thanks.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Ha! Darn. ,[both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chins], Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickled fish lips! ,[both cover their mouths], Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[in his mind], At least I'm safe inside my mind.
,Patrick:, ,[in his mind], At least I'm safe inside my mind.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[screaming],
,SpongeBob:, ,[he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab], Stop copying me!
,Patrick:, There's no award for that!
,Squidward:, ,[leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him], Well, I guess it's safe to go in now. ,[puts hat back on and walks back in],
,SpongeBob:, ,[he and Patrick are still running], Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?
,Patrick:, Until I have as many awards as you.
,SpongeBob:, We'll see about that!
,Patrick:, No, we won't.
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out a jump-rope], I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
,Patrick:, Me, too. ,[takes out a jump-rope],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice. ,[crosses arms and jump-ropes while Patrick tries to imitate but ties himself up with his rope], Ha! Not a scratch on me. ,[body breaks down into pieces],
,Patrick:, Oh, no, you don't! ,[squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces, then both hit a hammer on their heads],
,SpongeBob:, Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Are you kidding? I used to do this ,way, before I started copying you. ,[SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice; Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy, trophies appear and spin around his head, and falls on the ground; SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house; SpongeBob gets angry and steam comes out of his head],
,Patrick:, My turn! ,[runs into the pineapple rock],
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs into his house], I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. ,[pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit], Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, What's so great about being a big pink loser? ,[SpongeBob's nose pops back out], Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
,SpongeBob:, But, Patrick...
,Patrick:, Patrick's not here!
,Delivery Guy:, ,[stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck], Trophy delivery! ,[he drives off and SpongeBob has a package in his mouth],
,SpongeBob:, Another trophy?
,Patrick:, Oh, great! ,[SpongeBob opens the package], What's it for THIS time?
,SpongeBob:, 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! This trophy's for you!
,Patrick:, Yay! ,[puts trophy on his head like a hat], Eee! ,[both rip off their present outfits to reveal their own normal outfits],
,SpongeBob:, So, what are you gonna do, now?
,Patrick:, I'm gonna go protect my title. ,[jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes],
,Narrator:, So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.

"[at the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, I feel sorry for me self. ,[walks out of office],
,Squidward:, Would you like a drink with that order?
,Martin:, Oh no, thanks. I got me one of those new KelpShakes before I came in here.
,Squidward:, That comes out to two dollars even.
,Martin:, Wow, what a steal.
,Mr. Krabs:, What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Shocked], What? Why not? ,[Mr. Krabs sees SpongeBob slurping a soda can loudly], All right, boy, it's done! You're gonna suck the whole cup down your gullet if you're not careful.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good.
,Mr. Krabs:, KelpShake?
,SpongeBob:, Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake. ,[everyone is slurping their KelpShakes], Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill.

,Mr. Krabs:, Grr. I better get to the bottom of this. ,[Squidward secretly sips his KelpShake when Mr. Krabs leaves. Mr. Krabs walks outside], Ah! A new store! ,[store is shaped like a KelpShake], On my block! Taking my customers. ,[gasps], Pearl. ,[Pearl walks by while drinking a KelpShake], Me own flesh and blood. How could you do this to your papa?!
,Pearl:, What are you talking about, Dad?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm talking about this. ,[points to KelpShake],
,Pearl:, Once you taste the secret goodness of a KelpShake... ,[slurping], You can't have just one.
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me see that. ,[tries taking the KelpShake from Pearl, but she pulls it back],
,Pearl:, Buy your own.
,Mr. Krabs:, Why I wouldn't give them a cent.
,Pearl:, I feel sorry for you.
,Mr. Krabs:, Then you do understand. ,[starts to cry and grovels at her feet],
,Pearl:, Dad, you're embarrassing me. ,[drags her dad a few more feet before prying him off], Oh, get away. ,[Mr. Krabs is still crying],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret? ,[gasps], Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!
,Plankton:, Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong.
,Mr. Krabs:, Then how do you explain this? ,[points to the KelpShake restaurant],
,Plankton:, Holy Moley, how'd that happen?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't try that with me, Plankton. This new store is ruining me business.
,Plankton:, Really?! Wait a minute! That's my job! ,[groans], Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formuler.
,Plankton:, No, not another secret. And if there's a secret, I want to know about it! ,[rumbling],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh!
,Plankton:, ,[gasps as one KelpShake store multiplies itself to have two KelpShake stores], They're multiplying. Why, they're on every corner.
,Mr. Krabs:, Block after block.
,Plankton:, They're everywhere.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[a KelpShake store falls on both of them], We've got to do something about this. ,[cut to later where Mr. Krabs and Plankton walk into a KelpShake store], You sure this is going to work?
,Plankton:, Just stick to the plan.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[whistles], Oh, let's see, let's see. Ah, there you are. ,[spots an 'employees only' sign. Whispers to Plankton], Plankton, I think I found the kitchen.
,Plankton:, Let's do this thing!
,Mr. Krabs:, Here goes. Wa-choo! ,[sneezes on a mom and daughter], I'm sorry, I have a bit of a ,[gasping], ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...choo!! ,[continues sneezing on everything. he sneezes Plankton at the door window, but Plankton was unable to get into the kitchen],
,Employee:, Eww. ,[sprays a cleaner at Plankton],
,Plankton:, ,[screams], My eye, my eye, my eye! ,[Mr. Krabs and Plankton run out and hide behind the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, I think we lost them. Well, you got any more bright ideas?
,Plankton:, Of course I do. ,[cut to nighttime where Mr. Krabs and Plankton are wearing black ski clothes],
,Mr. Krabs:, All set, Plankton?
,Plankton:, You better believe it. This high-powered mechanical bio-arm I invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy. ,[presses a button that makes the hand move. The hand short-circuits], What the barnacles? Come on, you piece of garbage. ,[presses the button many times. The mechanical bio-arm slaps Plankton a bunch of times], Ouch! Uncle! Uncle!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Sighs], If you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself. ,[takes out a crowbar and tries to open the doors, but his back pops], Oh, me back. ,[moaning],
,Plankton:, ,[whispering], Krabs, pipe down. You're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog. ,[guardworm is sleeping],
,Mr. Krabs:, Never mind that. What about SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other?
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course we do.
,SpongeBob:, Then why is he in your fist? [Mr. Krabs and Plankton come up with a good explanation]
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh...we've gone into business together. You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door.
,Plankton:, Now we have to fix the roof. [winks]
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right. That's right. We have to fix the roof. It's, it's, it's leaking. ,[crickets chirping],
,SpongeBob:, Well, good luck with that. See ya. ,[cut to later where Mr. Krabs is using jackhammer to get into the roof],
,Plankton:, Keep her going, Krabs. At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say... ,[speaker comes up from under the roof],
,Speaker:, You have three seconds before spontaneous combustion. [a laser gun comes out]
,Plankton:, Let's beat it!
,Mr. Krabs:, No kidding. ,[runs],
,Plankton:, Wait, you forgotten... ,[gets zapped and disintegrates. Cut to the next day where a line of people are ordering KelpShakes. Plankton is under one of the tiles on the floor. He laughs maniacally until the customers step the tile, causing him to get squished, making him scream. Cut to Mr. Krabs lowering Plankton by a rope through the vent. Plankton is about to take a sip of a KelpShake when the customer takes a big sip first, swallowing Plankton. Plankton opens the customers mouth and is raised up through the vent. Cut to Mr. Krabs blowing Plankton through a hose and out of a sink pipe. When Plankton gets out, he is covered with KelpShake juice and gets drowned in the disposal], I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs! All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!
,Mr. Krabs:, What's that suppose to mean?
,Plankton:, I don't see you on the front lines. Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs Plankton], Who you are calling a gorilla, you one-cent, one-eyed bottom-feeder!?
,SpongeBob:, Mr Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one? ,[slurps his KelpShake],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Scared],Buy one?! ,[cut to later where Mr Krabs and Plankton are in line at the KelpShake store],
,Customer:, I'll have one KelpShake, please.
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know about this, Plankton.
,Plankton:, It's easy. Just smile and hand the cashier the money.
,Cashier:, Can I help you?
,Plankton:, Good luck.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?
,Cashier:, Sure, that'll be one dollar.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, okay. ,[gets out a dollar and slowly hands it to the cashier],
,Cashier:, ,[cash register dings], Thank you. ,[The cashier tries to take the dollar but Mr. Krabs is not letting go of his dollar.], Sir, please let go of the bill.
,Plankton:, Release your grip, man. Do it! ,[Mr. Krabs does so and groans as the money is taken. The cashier puts the dollar in the register and hands the KelpShake to Mr. Krabs],
,Cashier:, Enjoy.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks. ,[runs out laughing], I can't believe we did it.
,Plankton:, Oh, believe it, Krabs. Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of. ,[scene cuts to the KelpShake on a plate where a sample of the drink goes through a tube, into chemistry bottles, and finally into Karen where she begins a D-N-A scan], What's the secret ingredient, Karen?
,Karen:, Well, it appears that the main ingredient is, Kelp Juice.
,Plankton & Mr. Krabs:, Just kelp juice?
,Mr. Krabs:, And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!
,Plankton:, You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[removes the glass container and takes kelp juice], No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine.
,Plankton:, Not if I can help it. ,[jumps at Mr. Krabs, but goes between his eyes and splatters into the wall], Ow.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cackling], Nice try. ,[about to take a sip],
,Karen:, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's another ingredient.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, I paid good money for this thing. Of course I'm gonna drink it. ,[takes a sip then spits it out], What the...? I don't get what the big deal is. This tastes like a wet gym sock.
,Plankton:, Really? Let me try that. ,[Plankton sips the drink and puckers his lips], Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmmm. ,[sips again], Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad. ,[takes another sip and laughs], This is amazing.
,Plankton:, Well, don't be selfish. ,[sips and laughs], Oh yeah.
,Karen:, Oh no.
,Plankton:, ,[he sips in the rest of the drink until he sucks in the cup], Krabs, we're all out of juice.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, we gotta get more.
,Karen:, You're making a big mistake.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about. ,[he walks out with Plankton], KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake.
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up crying covered in yellowish-green fur], What's happening to me? ,[Mr. Krabs and Plankton gasp when they see SpongeBob covered in green kelp and he's naked], They've shutdown the KelpShake restaurants! ,[nearly crying as he runs off],
,Plankton & Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[They both see workers sucking out all the liquid in the KelpShake restaurant that says CLOSED FOREVER],
,Hazmat #1:, It'll take decades to clean this hazardous material up.
,Hazmat #2:, I sure do feel sorry for whoever drank this. ,[Mr. Krabs screams as he is growing yellowish-green kelp fur just like Plankton is, then Plankton screams],
,Plankton:, Look at us!
,Mr. Krabs:, Now what are we going to do?
,Plankton:, I don't know about you, ,[Plankton takes out a mini helicopter propeller], but I'm going back to what I do best. Stealing your recipe. ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, wait a minute! Plankton!
,Plankton:, ,[he flies into Mr. Krabs office where the safe is, he tosses the propeller and laughs], Come to papa. ,[Mr. Krabs opens the door],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold it right there. You're not going anywhere... ,[He opens the safe], without a ten second head start.
,Plankton:, It's good to be home.
,Mr. Krabs:, You said it.
,Plankton:, ,[he runs off as Mr. Krabs begins to chase him], I love being hated.

,SpongeBob:, But... the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab. Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave ,[nematodes eat his pants], Ow! Guys, you're ruining the ,[off-key], best day... ,[clears throat], Wait, no. ,[off-key], Best day... ,[plays his nose as a flute. The nematodes line up.

,Sandy:, ,[standing on a ladder, using a bucket to catch water in], SpongeBob, what on Earth are you doing?!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, just a little something I like to call karate.
,Sandy:, I can't right now, SpongeBob. I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse!
,SpongeBob:, Mm-hmm. I see. Okay, then I'll come back later. ,[walks off, but then reappears by Sandy and tries to karate chop her],

,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles], Yeah, I guess so. But then I was going to do karate with Sandy.
,Sandy:, I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I suppose. But then I was going to go jellyfishing with Patrick.
,Patrick:, But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?
,Squidward:, And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust.
,Mr. Krabs:, You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things.
,SpongeBob:, [starting to feel calm] It's not?

"[The episode begins at Bikini Bottom High School. A teenage fish walking past gets a doughnut thrown on him in which two teenage fish laugh and then spits on his friend's face. Another teenage male fish with headphones attempts to say hi to the teenage female fish who pass him while chatting but they only remove them and put them on the floor and walk off. A teen bully fish does a wedgie to a teenage nerdy fish who screams but the nerdy fish twists his nipple really hard causing him to run off crying. While all this is happening, Pearl and her friend is sitting down on a bench talking],
,Pearl:, Boy, do I love high school. ,[small laugh],. You know what? Someday we're gonna remember all this, and we're gonna look back and say... Remember?
,Pearl's friend:, ,[laughing], Speaking of remembering, you didn't forget the Bikini Bottom High School Dance is tomorrow night, did you?
,Pearl:, ,[Joyfully], Of course I didn't forget. I'm so excited.
,Pearl's friend:, ,[laughs], Me, too!
,[They both laugh until Pearl's friend stops in shock],
,Pearl's friend:, ,[In horror], Barnacle!
,Pearl:, What!?
,Pearl's friend:, Pearl I'm gonna say this as touchily as possible. ,[pointing], There is a hideous barnacle growing out of the side of your face!
,Pearl:, ,[Shocked], Where!?
,[Her friend moves her face so she can see it],
,Pearl's friend:, There!
,[Pearl notices the barnacle growing and starts screaming. So much that the entire Bikini Bottom is looking at her.],
,Pearl's friend:, Pearl, it's not really bad as you...
,[She screams again. All of the high school students are looking at her again. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob appears to be whistling while mopping the floors],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops mopping], Yes, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Didn't you already mop this area?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Affirmative, captain!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, then, why would you mop it again?
,SpongeBob:, Why wouldn't I? ,[there is a pause],
,Mr. Krabs:, Good point.
,[Pearl enters the Krusty Krab in tears],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?
,Pearl:, Oh, Daddy! It's terrible. The school dance is this weekend.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oooh, that is terrible. ,[he shivers], Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!
,Pearl:, No, daddy! Don't you understand?! The terrible part is that I can't go to the dance!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[comes closer], Why ever not?
,Pearl:, Because I have a hideous barnacle growing on the ,side of my face,!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you... ,[pus is shown oozing out of the barnacle; Krabs screams], Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!
,Pearl:, We have to get rid of it, no matter what it takes!
,Mr. Krabs:, Anything for me beloved angel!
,Pearl:, Oh, okay. I need an appointment with a dermatologist, a trip to the spa, expensive creams and lotions, and probably some other kind of... ,[Krabs stops her, angrily],
,Mr. Krabs:, I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund. ,[this causes Pearl to cry again, soaking a table Harold and Nat are having lunch at],
,Harold:, You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.
,Nat:, I heard they have better weather over there. ,[They leave the Krusty Krab], 
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chases after them but fails], No! Wait! ,[Pearl continues to wail], This is starting to eat away me profit margin. If I don't come up with a solution fast, it's gonna cost me more than a couple cases of cold cream. ,[He notices SpongeBob mopping past him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sings],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob stops], How would you like to... ,[He salutes], At ease! ,[SpongeBob drops his hand], How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?
,SpongeBob:, I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!
,[bubble transition to Pearl walking with SpongeBob],
,Pearl:, I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!
,SpongeBob:, Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!
,Pearl:, Are you sure?
,SpongeBob:, One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.
,Pearl:, How?
,SpongeBob:, I took him to see a hypnotist.
,Pearl:, You took Patrick to a hypnotist?
,SpongeBob:, No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.
,Pearl:, I thought you said it was a barnacle.
,SpongeBob:, What did I say?
,Pearl:, Pelican.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pauses for a second], He was a really good hypnotist.
,[bubble transition to Pearl's room],
,SpongeBob:, Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.
,Pearl:, Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughing], Hypnosis? No! Hold still now. ,[hits the barnacle],
,Pearl:, Is everything okay?
,SpongeBob:, ,[shows broken spatula], I don't think this is going to work. ,[Brings in a shovel], This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work! ,[hits the barnacle],
,Pearl:, Did it come off?
,SpongeBob:, ,[the shovel is stuck in his head], Gettin' there.
,[Next, SpongeBob tries removing the barnacle with a jackhammer.],
,Pearl:, SpongeBob, how much longer?
,SpongeBob:, Oh... shouldn't be too much longer. ,[the jackhammer disintegrates], Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like.
,Pearl:, Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[he throws the jackhammer aside, which lands in a pile of other broken tools],
,[In the bathroom, Pearl is putting some soap on a towel and scrubbing it on her barnacle. She suddenly screams and SpongeBob hears it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks into the bathroom], Pearl! ,[Pearl is seen with soap covering her face], Pearl, what happened?
,Pearl:, There's more! ,[the soap slides off her face, exposing lots of barnacles everywhere],
,SpongeBob:, ,[shrieks], I mean, you're right. There's more.
,Pearl:, ,[puzzled], All I did was wash with soap and water!
,SpongeBob:, ,[examines the soap], Hmm... Water and... this soap?
,Pearl:, Yes, but why?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffs the bar of soap], Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere. ,[keeps sniffing the soap], Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?
,Pearl:, No.
,SpongeBob:, ,[continues sniffing], More for me!
,[we cut to the living room, where Pearl is seen with her face smothered in concealing cream. She mumbles something],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding the jar of cream], No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing. ,[Mr. Krabs enters the house with the groceries],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[humming], Pearl, I'm home! ,[screams loudly],
,SpongeBob:, Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized... ,[sweetly], it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl. ,[Pearl mumbles again], Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of. ,[Mr. Krabs walks over to a safe full of diamonds and jumps in], Me jewels!
,[later, Pearl is in the bathroom crying again],
,SpongeBob:, Pearl? ,[knocks on the bathroom door], Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.
,Pearl:, ,[from inside], I'm not going to the dance!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I'm coming in! ,[opens the door, which causes a flood of tears to gush out into the hallway. SpongeBob swims against the current and makes it in], Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.
,Pearl:, And what exactly would that do to me?
,SpongeBob:, I have no idea. ,[Pearl bawls], Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!
,Pearl:, How?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up. ,[something DOES pop up, and it's more barnacles], Oops, I didn't mean it like that. ,[sees the bar of soap and picks it up], Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again. ,[starts sniffing the soap again],
,Pearl:, ,[snatches it away],
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Where do you keep your soap?
,Pearl:, In the basement. Duh, where else? ,[scrubs her face more],
,[Torch in hand, SpongeBob is entering the darkened basement when he hears a strange noise],
,SpongeBob:, ,[echoes], Hello? ,[SpongeBob jumps when he hears the echo, but keeps going until he hears another noise and turns around], Something there? Pearl?! ,[His torch goes out, making it completely dark. SpongeBob sees a door opening and goes through it to find Mr. Krabs, trying to pull a stuck handle], Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this! ,[they both pull at the handle until it moves], There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?
,Mr. Krabs:, Why, it's my old soap press!
,SpongeBob:, Soap press?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!
,SpongeBob:, Leftover Krabby Patties?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[tosses a Krabby Patty into the machine], Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap! ,[the new soap falls off the conveyor belt into a basket], Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.
,SpongeBob:, ,[picks up one of the soap bars and sniffs it], Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...
,Pearl:, ,[lividly], I've been using soap made out of ,Krabby Patties?,
,Mr. Krabs:, Krabby Patty ,essence,.
,Pearl:, That's ,grease!,
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose-
,Pearl:, ,[furiously], ,Daddy!, ,[throws soap at her father],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs away in fear], Got to go, keep your cellphone!
,Pearl:, ,[bursts into tears and rubs her eyes making squeaky sounds], I'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off! My young life is ruined forever.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?
,Pearl:, ,[wails], The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my-
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!
,Pearl:, Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...
,[cut to SpongeBob on a ladder and Pearl beside him in her room],
,Pearl:, Are you done yet?
,SpongeBob:, ,[climbs down the ladder], All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three. ,[turns Pearl's chair to face the mirror. Pearl has blue diamonds on her face to hide her barnacles], And, ta-da. What do you think?
,Pearl:, I don't know, SpongeBob - what would my friends say?
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks her to the living room], We shall see shortly.
,Pearl:, Are you sure?
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens the front door], Shh. Trust me.
,[Three of Pearl's friends, a green fish, a blue fish, and a pink-orange fish, enter the house],
,Blue fish:, Pearl, we're here to pick you up to the- wow! Pearl, you look amazing!
,Pearl:, I do?
,Blue fish:, Well, not amazing. Sparkly and shiny and amazing!
,Pearl:, Whee! To the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
,Pearl and her friends:, ,[laughing], Let's go! ,[they run out of the house, and SpongeBob shuts the door behind them],
,SpongeBob:, You have a good time, carefree teens!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams and exits his jewel safe], My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?
,SpongeBob:, Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
,Mr. Krabs:, Help! Police! Thief! ,[runs out of the house, running through the door], Stop that whale!
,SpongeBob:, I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise.

"Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
,SpongeBob:, Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
,Mr. Krabs:, Fine?! ,[grabs SpongeBob's mouth and ties it up], Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. ,[cries],
,SpongeBob:, Time off?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. ,[runs out],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, that went better than expected.
,SpongeBob:, ,[running down the street], I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation. ,[enters his house], Hey, Gary.
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary. ,[walks into his bed and closes his eyes for no more than two seconds before his alarm goes off. Scene cuts to him lifting his weights, eating cereal, flossing, showering, then putting on some spray to make him shine. He grabs his hat then walks into the Krusty Krab], Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
,Squidward:, I thought you were on vacation.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stops SpongeBob], He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
,SpongeBob:, What's a vacation?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], No work?! But what'll I do all day?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
,SpongeBob:, But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
,Squidward:, Nor will I.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
,Patrick:, ,[walks in], Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
,Mr. Krabs:, Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.
,SpongeBob:, Replacement?
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's enough banter on my dime.
,Patrick:, Ok, boss.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. ,[takes SpongeBob's hat and spatula and gives it to Patrick],
,Patrick:, Wow. ,[notices his reflection in the spatula], Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher. ,[scratches his belly and his back], Wow. It scratches backs, too!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
,SpongeBob:, I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. ,[Mr. Krabs shuts the doors in SpongeBob's face. Scene cuts to inside SpongeBob's house],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work. ,[stomach growls then shrinks. SpongeBob gasps], My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! ,[scene cuts to Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
,SpongeBob:, I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
,SpongeBob:, I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
,SpongeBob:, You have my word, sir. No working. ,[enters kitchen], Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch... ,[screams as he sees Patrick putting patties, attached to his body, on the grill], Patrick, you can't do that!
,Patrick:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit. ,[turns the knob to the right from 297 to 298. Takes Patrick's spatula], Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[storms into the kitchen], SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
,SpongeBob:, Wait, it's not what you think.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[wheels SpongeBob on a dolly], Out you go, boy.
,SpongeBob:, But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
,Mr. Krabs:, We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, boy... ,[launches SpongeBob off], off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob entering his house],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. ,[sits down in front of a toy Krusty Krab with Krusty Krew figures. Opens it up],
,Squidward:, ,[SpongeBob imitating him], SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[SpongeBob imitating him], SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. ,[takes SpongeBob's Krusty hat off. SpongeBob walks home, sad],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walking inside his pineapple], Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. ,[plays with a smaller Krusty Krab playset],
,Squidward:, ,[SpongeBob imitating him], I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. ,[scene cuts to Krusty Krab where Squidward is washing windows until he sees SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up. ,[SpongeBob steps backwards], Further. ,[steps backwards more], Further. ,[steps backwards more], Further. ,[steps backwards more], Further. ,[steps backwards until he is in front of his house], That'll do.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally. ,[looks at his net], Hey, that reminds me of... ,[his net turns into a spatula. Pretends to grill but stops], Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax. ,[floats onto the ground], That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds. ,[watches a cloud go by], That one's a jellyfish! ,[another cloud goes by], That's a pirate ship. ,[another cloud goes by], And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup? ,[scene cuts to Krusty Krab where a delivery truck backs up. SpongeBob, in a disguise, walks up to the kitchen door], Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. ,[another delivery truck backs up. A delivery fish gets out with the same buns on a plate],
,Delivery Fish:, Huh? What's the big idea, here? ,[SpongeBob laughs nervously then gets booted out. Scene cuts to the phone ringing inside the Krusty Krab. Patrick answers],
,Patrick:, Hello? Hello? Hello? ,[SpongeBob slips through phone cord and through Patrick's head but gets shot out of the Krusty Krab, through the doors. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab restroom where Patrick is cleaning out his ear], Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear. ,[notices water splashing out from the toilet behind him], Hey, I just cleaned that one.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, shhh.
,Patrick:, It talks! ,[screams and runs out],
,SpongeBob:, Somebody help, I'm stuck! ,[Mr. Krabs walks up], Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here. ,[Mr. Krabs grabs a cord above the toilet], Um, Mr. Krabs? ,[Mr. Krabs flushes the toilet], Noooo!! ,[gets flushed down the toilet. Scene cuts to SpongeBob jumping out of a customers shirt and into the grease fryer in the kitchen], Uh oh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now what? ,[picks up the fryer and sees SpongeBob small and deep fried], Tsk, tsk, tsk. ,[SpongeBob then crumbles into crumbs and puts him in his boat out back], I've had enough for one day, son. ,[drives off],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not a problem at all, me boy.
,SpongeBob:, Just take the next right. ,[Mr. Krabs drives past his house], Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-huh.
,SpongeBob:, My house is back that way, Mr. K.
,Mr. Krabs:, Far out, little man. Far out. ,[drives into a forest and stops],
,SpongeBob:, Where'd you say you were taking me?
,Mr. Krabs:, Look, boy, ,[takes out a spatula], I brought your spatuler. ,[SpongeBob glares at the spatula and acts like a dog], C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it! ,[throws the spatula into the forest. SpongeBob chases after it while Mr. Krabs turns around and drives off], Enjoy your vacation, boy!
,SpongeBob:, It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a... ,[gasps], ,...permanent vacation!, That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them! ,[scene cuts to Patrick running down the street to his rock],
,Patrick:, Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember. ,[opens his rock and jumps in], Huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sitting in the corner of Patrick's rock], Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob? Is that you?
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around with an evil look on his face], I've been waiting for you, Patrick! ,[walks towards Patrick, growling],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh! ,[SpongeBob laughs maniacally and closes in around Patrick. Scene cuts to Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, What’ll be?
,Customer:, One Krabby Patty, please.
,Squidward:, One shell on a shingle. ,[Patrick gives Squidward the order then many orders come out, it blocks the window just for Mr. Krabs to notice],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it. ,[Patrick turns around, and it turns out to be SpongeBob in a Patrick costume], SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. ,[Patrick is sitting at home watching a broken TV],
,Mr. Krabs:, Why'd you do it, laddy?
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts to cry], Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
,Mr. Krabs:, You don't have to. ,[takes out a calendar], Your accumulated vacation time is used up. ,[tears up calendar], The union can't fine me, anymore.
,SpongeBob:, You must've saved a fortune.
,Mr. Krabs:, Bumping barnacles, yes. ,[laughs and holds up a dime], There she is.
,SpongeBob:, Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps out of the Patrick costume], Yippee! I happily acquiesce.

,SpongeBob:, Nice and easy. Doing great.
,[Mrs. Puff continues driving.],
,Harold:, Hello!
,[Mrs. Puff waves to Harold.],
,Mrs. Puff:, You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad. ,[laughs], Maybe I could—
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!
,[Mrs. Puff frantically panics now that she is on the freeway.],
,SpongeBob:, It's okay! Just calm down!
,[Mrs. Puff swerves the bubble boat to the left.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Eeh! Oh!
,[A passing driver makes Mrs. Puff's bubble boat spin around. The bubble boat hits two other drivers and bounces off into another street. Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob are driving in a one-way street and almost get hit by other drivers.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Ah!
,[SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff move around in the bubble boat in panic.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh!
,[Mrs. Puff's bubble boat hits Nathiel Waters' bubble boat.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh! ,[inflates herself and pops her bubble boat],
,[SpongeBob was sent flying into the ground. He pulls his head out of the sand.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah!
,[Mrs. Puff's inflated body causes a pileup in the middle of the road. The bubble boats send Mrs. Puff and the other drivers flying to the surface.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?
,[The bubble boats reach the surface and they pop, sending everyone falling downward. SpongeBob quickly takes out his bubble soap and blows a lot of bubbles. SpongeBob's bubbles catches and saves everyone.],
,SpongeBob:, Doh!
,[SpongeBob blows one last bubble to save Mrs. Puff.],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[wipes the soap off], No more bubbles. Get them off me!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? ,[laughs],
,Motorcycle Cop:, ,[takes bubble wand], Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats! ,[breaks the bubble wand and leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[inflates herself], Oh, joy. ,[pops],

"Narrator:, ,[Camera cuts to the exterior of The Krusty Krab], Closing time at the Krusty Krab. 
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Counting the change in the cash register], 51, 52, 53... 
,Squidward:, ,[Counting his suction cups], 29, 30, 31... 
,SpongeBob:, ,[Mopping in synchronization], One, two, three. One, two, three. 
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, can we please go now? 
,Mr. Krabs:, Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[Referencing the manual], ""The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for."" 
,Squidward:, But that's not fair! 
,SpongeBob:, ,[Referencing the manual, again], ""Clause 3b: The proprietor reserves the right to be unfair."" 
,Squidward:, Teacher's pet. 
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's see... ,[counts money in register], ...five, ten, 25, blue, apple sauce. Everything looks to be in order. Except... ,[gasps], Where is it? ,[takes apart the register in search of something], Where is it? 
,Squidward:, What? 
,Mr. Krabs:, My dime! Me special dime, the first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck! 
,Squidward:, Well, I've never seen it. ,[Mr. Krabs glares at Squidward in suspicion], 
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on a stack of interpretive dance quarterlies? ,[pulls out a stack of dance quarterlies], 
,Squidward:, Of course I'm... ,[makes a shocked face], What are you saying? 
,Mr. Krabs:, Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test! ,[holding a lie detector in his hands], 
,Squidward:, You're saying something! 
,Mr. Krabs:, Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day! 
,Squidward:, Are you accusing me of something? 
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you stole it. Two, you stole it. Or three—you stole it! 
,Squidward:, ,[enraged], I didn't take your precious dime! 
,Mr. Krabs:, Show me your tentacles. 
,Squidward:, What?! 
,Mr. Krabs:, I wanna see empty suction cups. 
,Squidward:, ,[squeezes Mr. Krabs' eyes with his tentacles in anger], Here! Here! Here! See 'em?! ,[stomps away], 
,Mr. Krabs:, You-you can't do that to me. I'm your boss! 
,Squidward:, Not anymore, Mr. Krabs. I quit! ,[throws his hat down. The hat falls in slow motion], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], No. ,[catches the hat with a pillow], Whew. 
,Squidward:, I'm outta here! 
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, you're making a big mistake! 
,Squidward:, Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab! 
,SpongeBob:, But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles? ,[smiles really big], 
,Squidward:, Being dead or anything else! 
,SpongeBob:, I never knew you felt so strongly about it. 
,Squidward:, Where have you been? 
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter. ,[Norma appears with cookies on a silver platter and offers SpongeBob a cookie], 
,Norma Rechid:, Free sample? 
,SpongeBob:, Cookies! ,[Takes one, and eats it], 
,Squidward:, Can I have one–? ,[Norma is already gone], 
,SpongeBob:, Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me... ,[grabs Squidward and pulls him toward himself], ...we're like brothers, only closer. ,[lifts Squidward's shirt and their hearts are somehow joined together and beating in unison. Creepy alien music plays before Squidward screams and leaps away from SpongeBob], 
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to. ,[imagines himself in various following jobs], I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman. 
,SpongeBob:, Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache. 
,Squidward:, Yeah...uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... Goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands! ,[skips to a homeless Squidward in a box trying to get spare change in a cup from passersby], Spare change? Spare change, ma'am? 
,SpongeBob:, Squidward? Squidward, is that you? 
,Squidward:, Uh, I, uh... ,[closes his box], 
,SpongeBob:, It's me, SpongeBob. ,[opens his box up], We used to work together. 
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? 
,SpongeBob:, There ya go. So, where you living these days? 
,Fish:, Squidward Tentacles? 
,Squidward:, Yes? 
,Fish:, Sign here please. ,[Squidward signs and the fish takes his box], 
,Squidward:, Uh... nowhere. 
,SpongeBob:, Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess...Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell...you're a football player? 
,Squidward:, No. 
,SpongeBob:, A spaceman? 
,Squidward:, No. 
,SpongeBob:, A football playing king in space-- 
,Squidward:, Don't you get it? ,[sobs], I'm a lose-e-er! I lost my job, my home, everything! 
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Even your paintings? 
,Squidward:, Nobody would take them. So I had to eat them. ,[his stomach is shown to have a rectangular shape from his eaten painting. Squidward starts to cry out a fountain of tears into SpongeBob. SpongeBob soaks it up and becomes bigger, but he squishes himself to let the water out], 
,SpongeBob:, There, there. You can come live with me. ,[shown at SpongeBob's house], Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed. ,[Squidward is laying in SpongeBob's bed], 
,Squidward:, Okay, but just until I get a job. One day...two days tops. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[baby talk], Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to. ,[kisses Squidward on his nose], Good night, my little angel. ,[the next morning, SpongeBob rings a bell to wake Squidward], Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you. 
,Squidward:, And in bed, too? Aw, thanks, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I... 
,SpongeBob:, Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane. ,[makes plane noises while attempting to put some food in Squidward's mouth with a spoon], 
,Squidward:, It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. I'll try not to be a burden. 
,SpongeBob:, It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner? 
,Squidward:, No, no, no. You've already...well... ,[shows SpongeBob putting lotion on his hand and then massaging Squidward's scalp, feeding him grapes, spraying his scalp with hairspray and shining it, massaging his back then his nose, giving him a baby bottle, giving him an acupuncture, and polishing his head and seeing his reflection], 
,SpongeBob:, Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good. ,[yawns], Good night, Gary. 
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water? ,[bottom floor light turns on and SpongeBob marches up stairs and turns on the light to give Squidward the water], Thank you. 
,SpongeBob:, Good night. ,[marches back down stairs and turns off the light], 
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets? ,[SpongeBob marches upstairs again turning on the lights on the way up there], 
,SpongeBob:, Here you go. 
,Squidward:, Thank you. ,[SpongeBob goes downstairs again, accidentally leaving Squidward's light], SpongeBob, you forgot to turn out the light! ,[SpongeBob marches upstairs], 
,SpongeBob:, Good night. ,[turns off light and when he walks downstairs he trips and makes lots of noises], 
,Gary:, Meow. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me. 
,Narrator:, Three weeks later... 
,SpongeBob:, He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back. ,[falls down], 
,Narrator:, Many months later... 
,SpongeBob:, I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough. 
,New Narrator:, So much later that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one... 
,[SpongeBob drags himself into the room, by now utterly exhausted. Gary doesn't look sympathetic, though.], 
,Gary:, Meow, meow, meow. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[annoyed], I know he still isn't looking for work! Don't rub it in! 
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, where's my lemonade? 
,SpongeBob:, Coming, Squidward. ,[He falls flat on his face], 
,Squidward:, ,[SpongeBob is running down the hallway], SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?! ,[SpongeBob enters his bedroom], And why aren't you in uniform? ,[SpongeBob exits room and re-enters in a maid outfit], It's about time you got here! 
,SpongeBob:, ,[sardonically], Here you go, Your Majesty. 
,Squidward:, I can't drink that. 
,SpongeBob:, Why not? 
,Squidward:, Are you blind? Just look at it. ,[close-up of the lemonade], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[becomes irritated], What about it? 
,Squidward:, That lemon has three seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered. 
,SpongeBob:, Fine, I'll just take it out. ,[takes out lemon and Squidward gets mad], 
,Squidward:, No! No! It's already contaminated by the bad lemon! It won't work! 
,SpongeBob:, Hmm, that's two things in this house that ,won't work., 
,Squidward:, Then go fix them. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[grips the glass of lemonade so hard that it shatters], Two things that ,won't work!, 
,Squidward:, I've changed my mind. I want soup instead. 
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Don't move. ,[walks out the bedroom door, revealing his white briefs. He the closes the door, and comes back in wearing normal clothes with a bowl of steaming soup], Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it ,special. [shows soup with the phrase ""GET A JOB"" in alphabet letters but then Squidward slaps it out of SpongeBob's hands], 
,Squidward:, Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting! Now you've ruined my appetite! Go fetch me something to read! 
,SpongeBob:, Oh, okay. How about this? ,[pulls out a newspaper with the ""job listings"" page on the front], 
,Squidward:, ,[gasps and swats the newspaper away. SpongeBob becomes more angry], Get that away from me! You know I'm allergic to newsprint! 
,SpongeBob:, ,[chortles], Ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did...,At his job!, ,[SpongeBob's alarm blows him away], 
,Squidward:, 4:00. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around. ,[SpongeBob rolls in a TV and hands Squidward the remote. Squidward turns it on to see two puppets: one green puppet and one lime green puppet wearing a shirt and tie], 
,Puppet #1:, ,[puppet #2 is whistling], Hey, where are you going? 
,Puppet #2:, To my job. 
,Puppet #1:, You have a job? 
,Puppet #2:, Why wouldn't I? I'm not some lazy, inconsiderate jerk who lays in bed all day. 
,Puppet #1:, Say, where can I get one of these...jobs? 
,Puppet #2:, Oh, they're everywhere. ,[we see SpongeBob playing with the puppets], Especially if you're green and have six tentacles. 
,Puppet #1:, Thanks. I'm gonna go look for one so I can stop... 
,SpongeBob:, ...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives! 
,Squidward:, This isn't my show. ,[presses the remote, but nothing happens], SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it! 
,SpongeBob:, I've got a better idea! ,[throws the TV away and jumps on top of Squidward in bed], Why don't I call someone whose ,job, it is to fix it? You know why? Because when I need a ,job, ,[pokes Squidward's nose], done I get someone with a ,job, ,[pokes Squidward's nose], to do ,[pokes Squidward's nose], that ,JOB!, ,[pokes Squidward's nose for the fourth time], 
,Squidward:, ,[narrows his eyelids], What are you saying? 
,[This turns out to be the last straw. Outside, it is day. SpongeBob's house jumps into the air before the side is smashed out as an enraged SpongeBob pushes the bed, with Squidward still in it, outside and towards the Krusty Krab while screaming in extreme and total fury.], 
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[talking on his phone], Donate to the children's fund? Why? What have children ever done for me? ,[SpongeBob grabs phone and throws it away], 
,SpongeBob:, You want your dime back?! ,[takes one out], Take it! Now Squidward can come back, right? ,[Mr. Krabs checks the dime through a telescope], 
,Mr. Krabs:, Wrong! ,[throws the dime at SpongeBob's face], That ain't my first dime. 
,SpongeBob:, Then have some more dimes! ,[throws out more dimes at Mr. Krabs' face. Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes], I've got plenty of 'em! 
,Mr. Krabs:, You can't put a price on me first dime! And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat, Squidward for stealing it! 
,SpongeBob:, ,[finally snapping in extreme rage, he grabs Mr. Krabs by the throat and holds him up in the air], Listen, you crustaceous cheapskate! Squidward's been living at my house driving me crazy! ,[shakes him vigorously], ,AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIRE HIM BACK ALL BECAUSE OF A STUPID DIME?!, ,[a prehistoric dime falls out of Mr. Krabs' back pocket. SpongeBob suddenly calms down and lets go of Mr. Krabs], What's that? 
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Me first dime. ,[hugs the dime], Oh, ""Dimey,"" I'll never lose you again. 
,SpongeBob:, This is a dime? 
,Mr. Krabs:, I've been in business a long time, boy. 
,SpongeBob:, So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right? 
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy. ,[kisses the dime. SpongeBob cheers before running off], 
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[at the counter], Well, Mr. Squidward, it's good to have ya back. 
,Squidward:, Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir. 
,Mr. Krabs:, It's all water under the bridge now. 
,Squidward:, I agree, sir. 
,Mr. Krabs:, After all, I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime. 
,Squidward:, What the...? What are you saying? 
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants. Dimes just don't fly into people's pants. 
,Squidward:, Are you accusing me of something? ,[SpongeBob puts the maid costume back on over his clothes], 
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants. ,[outside the Krusty Krab], Two, you put the dime in me pants. Or three—you put the dime in me pants!

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are crowding in front of the little window. Bubble Bass is sitting on Squidward and Squidward struggles to free himself from the bottom.],
,Squidward:, ,[grunts as he tries to free himself], You people are proof that evolution can go in reverse!
,Customers:, Shh!
,[The customers watch as SpongeBob juggles the Krabby Patties and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob ""shoots"" them flat like shooting a gun.],
,Customers:, Ooh! Ahh!
,[SpongeBob sprays ketchup and mustard on the buns. He bangs on the grill and sends the patties flying. Then he makes six perfect Krabby Patties.],
,SpongeBob:, Ta-da!
,[The customers applaud for SpongeBob's talented performance.],
,Bubble Bass:, Ooh, impressive! That's most impressive!
,[Mr. Krabs comes in.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, why aren't these walking wallets spending money?
,Squidward:, ,[grunts and talks muffled], Because they're too busy watching SpongeBob cook!
,Mr. Krabs:, What? ,[climbs onto Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[gets stepped on by Mr. Krabs], Ow!
,[Mr. Krabs climbs onto the customers and take a peak in the kitchen. SpongeBob is spraying ketchup and mustard on the buns.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. Well, he's not exactly maximerizing his worktime with those flourishes. But, boy, does that boy-o have talent. ,[his eyes become light bulbs with dollar signs on them; he turns them on with his nose], Ding! ,[climbs down and grabs a mallet], And talent equals money!
,[The customers turn and run as they see Mr. Krabs preparing to smash a hole in the wall. Squidward screams and runs away as well. Mr. Krabs smashes the wall really hard and makes a massive hole between the kitchen and the dining room. SpongeBob finishes his juggling act and turns around. He becomes startled to see the massive hole Mr. Krabs made.],
,SpongeBob:, I have X-ray vision! I can see through walls!
,Mr. Krabs:, Calm your waters, lad. I just knocked it down.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jibbers], Why'd you do that?
,Mr. Krabs:, In the restaurant business, it's called an open kitchen so the customers can watch the cook cook.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure.
,Mr. Krabs:, Nonsense. You're a born performer. ,[looks around and sees a closet], Ooh! ,[carries SpongeBob to the closet], Here. ,[takes out a pen, opens it, and draws a star on it], You even got your own dressing room. See? Huh? Huh?
,[A Krabby Patty falls from the shelf. SpongeBob runs in and locks the door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm? Uh... ,[jiggles the doorknob], Come on, boy-o, it's showtime!
,SpongeBob:, ,[whimpers as he looks through the mop on his head], I can't! I've got stage fright!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, if you don't come out, you're fired!
,[SpongeBob reluctantly comes out of the closet and feels nervous.],
,Mr. Krabs:, There he is! ,[flicks SpongeBob's hat off and gives him a toque], ChefBob! ,[grabs SpongeBob and closes the closet with his foot], Me little star! ,[pushes SpongeBob to the grill], Break a leg. Break two legs.
,Fred:, ,[holds up his leg], My leg!
,Mr. Krabs:, Shut up, Fred! ,[makes his leave], Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
,[The customers cheer. SpongeBob is really nervous and unsure about this open kitchen business. He grabs a patty and he wipes the sweat off his head.],
,Customers:, Ooh!
,[SpongeBob puts the patty onto the grill, but accidentally burns it. He grabs a bun filled with mustard and puts the burnt patty on it. He puts his shoe and a bar of soap on the patty. SpongeBob presents it and the customers seem confused.],
,Harold Reginald:, What?
,[Now Mr. Krabs is getting a little nervous, but keeps his cool by smiling.],
,Fred:, That's just wrong!
,[SpongeBob grabs a tube of toothpaste and smears it on the patty. The customers are still confused.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, boy-o! Razzle-dazzle them!
,[SpongeBob hides under the grill trying to think of a solution to his stage fright problem.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what do I do? What do I do? ,[sees a paper bag], Huh? Oh!
,[SpongeBob grabs the bag and makes it into a small little puppet version of himself, ChefBob. He slowly shows the puppet to the customers and Mr. Krabs. The customers are amazed at it.],
,ChefBob:, Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
,[The customers shrug in confusion. The couldn't figure out how to respond to it. One customer was gnawing on his hand.],
,Dave:, I guess I am.
,ChefBob:, Welcome, welcome to my job in the kitchen of ChefBob! I cook and dance, I wear square pants, cooking for this hungry mob! ,[singsong], Your order, please!
,[The customers cheer and SpongeBob is happy.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[rubs his claws together], The little ChefBob is a sensation.
,[The scene changes to all of the customers gathering around to see the ChefBob show Mr. Krabs put up. ChefBob comes out from the curtain.],
,ChefBob:, Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
,Customers:, We are!
,[ChefBob grabs some patties and juggles them. and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob ""shoots"" them flat like shooting a gun just like how SpongeBob did earlier. SpongeBob grins happily at ChefBob's performance. ChefBob flips three patties and grabs one with a whip. He gives the patty to a cowboy and stamps a picture of himself with a branding iron.],
,ChefBob:, Huh?
,[The scene changes to ChefBob playing magic tricks with the patties. He pulls a patty from Jennifer Millie and Clay's ears.],
,ChefBob:, Ha, ho! Ha, ho! Voilà!
,[ChefBob throws the patties on the grill after they bounced onto Squidward's nose.],
,ChefBob:, Ta-da!
,[The customers cheer.],
,Clay:, ,[looks at his watch], Oh-ho! Look at the time. I gotta get home and get my beauty sleep.
,Squidward:, Oh, what died on that guy's neck? Oh, it's his head.
,[Squidward's insult was accidently heard out loud by ChefBob.],
,ChefBob:, Huh?
,[ChefBob comes up with an idea. He thinks that he could use insults to make himself popular. He slides over to Clay just as he was about to leave.],
,ChefBob:, Hey, what died on your neck? Oh, it's your head!
,[The customers laugh, but Squidward is offended by it. Clay felt embarrassed at first, but laughs along with the customers.],
,Squidward:, Oh, that little plagiarist. That was my line.
,Clay:, ,[laughs], Obviously, the sleep hasn't been helping! ,[makes a hideous face as he laughs],
,[SpongeBob becomes shocked at what he just heard.],
,SpongeBob:, D-did I say that? I didn't say that.
,Jennifer Mille:, ,[laughs and grabs ChefBob], Hey, do me! Insult me!
,ChefBob:, Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
,Jennifer Mille:, ,[laughs], That was a good one.
,ChefBob:, ,[gets grabbed by SpongeBob], Huh? Oh!
,SpongeBob:, ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers.
,Harold (red fish):, Me next! ,[ChefBob goes back up], Shoot me a zinger!
,ChefBob:, Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that. ,[shoots an arrow on Harold's head], I don't speak ""goober!""
,[The paper with the word ""Goober"" rolls down and the customers laugh.],
,Harold (red fish):, ,[laughs], I love it! Guilty as charged! ,[laughs and sheds a tear],
,[The customers yell out at ChefBob to make more insults and give him money and jewels. He even gives them their autographs for their books and their children.],
,Squidward:, Oh, great. I've created a monster. A funny, talented monster.
,[The scene changes to ChefBob powdering his nose in his dressing room.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ho, ho, ho, ho! ,[flicks money], Oh, I gotta hand it to ya! That new insult comedy act is really bringing in the money!
,[SpongeBob, with a sad look on his face, turns around and gives Mr. Krabs a paper.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, what's this, here?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh-ho, does he? ,[reads the list], ""Fresh cut seaweed."" ,[his smile turns upside-down], ""A manicurist for SpongeBob's puppet hand?"" What? ,[gets angry], ""A bigger dressing room?""
,ChefBob:, In the meantime, we'll just take over your office, Blubber Boy.
,Mr. Krabs:, Blubber Boy?! ,[his belly blubbers; he lowers his shirt and rips up the paper], No way! ,[stomps the paper bits on the ground],
,ChefBob:, ,[grabs Mr. Krabs], What's the matter, Krabs? ,[flicks his nose], You don't like money? ,[whacks Mr. Krabs in the face with money],
,[Mr. Krabs takes the money and puts them in the bag.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[weepy], What?... Of course I like money. The office will be ready in five minutes. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?
,ChefBob:, Need I remind you that my insults pay your salary?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.
,[SpongeBob and ChefBob leave the closet.],
,Squidward:, ChefBob, you stole my line! I do all the insults around here!
,ChefBob:, ,[grabs Squidward's hand], Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. You're absolutely right.
,Squidward:, Um, oh, well, uh, thank you. It's—it's—it's really not such a big deal.
,ChefBob:, Let me make it up to ya! ,[grabs Squidward and drags him and SpongeBob outside], Hi, everybody! I'd like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine: Squidward Tentacles!
,[The customers cheer.],
,Squidward:, Huh? Oh, no. Please, please, you're to—you're too kind.
,ChefBob:, I was gonna ask Squidward how old he was, but then I remembered he can't count that high!
,Squidward:, ,[dumbfounded], Huh?
,[ChefBob sprays water in Squidward's eye and the customers laugh at his humiliation. Squidward shrinks down nervously and pops.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[growls], Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!
,Squidward:, ,[reappears next to Mr. Krabs], That's even more insulting.
,ChefBob:, Get a load of him, folks! He must've been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen! ,[grabs a rubber chicken and hits SpongeBob with it],
,[The customers laugh. SpongeBob grabs the rubber chicken and goes to whack ChefBob with it, but ends up hitting Nat Peterson.],
,Nat Peterson:, Ow! Not funny!
,[SpongeBob and ChefBob both get into a fight. ChefBob flings SpongeBob to a table and crash onto it. The customers continue to think this is part of the act and continue to laugh. ChefBob grabs SpongeBob, swings him around and flings him to the bathroom.],
,Jimmy Gus:, He scores!
,[The customers rush into the bathroom.],
,Fred:, Yeah, yeah! Fight in the bathroom!

,ChefBob:, Have a drink!
,[SpongeBob struggles to get up, but ChefBob pushes him down the toilet. SpongeBob pulls the lever, hoping to flush ChefBob down along with him.],
,ChefBob:, No, no! ,[grabs the lever but gets flushed down the toilet],
,[The customers become worried now that SpongeBob and ChefBob are flushed. In the kitchen, SpongeBob and ChefBob emerge from the sink and crash into a box of spatulas. SpongeBob and ChefBob engage in a spatula sword fight.],
,SpongeBob:, En garde!
,[SpongeBob and ChefBob fight each other with all their might. They exit the kitchen and continue their fight in the dining room while the customers watch. ChefBob removes the spatula from SpongeBob's grasp and goes to finish him. SpongeBob holds his ground and keeps ChefBob's spatula from hitting him. ChefBob cackles evilly as if he was about to win. Just as ChefBob was about to deliver the final blow, SpongeBob lifts ChefBob, grabs the spatula with his teeth, and throws it onto a poster in the wall. SpongeBob hops in the boat, opens the cash register and slams the drawer onto ChefBob. The customers gasp in fright and realize that SpongeBob and ChefBob's battle is not part of the act and is not funny at all. The parent and the child cry at the sight. The customers become disgusted with this and they leave the restaurant just as SpongeBob collapses from exhaustion.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me customers! ,[gets angry and walks over to ChefBob, who's punching SpongeBob], Alright, enough of this. ,[grabs ChefBob off of SpongeBob's hand and holds up a hand puppet version of himself],
,Hand puppet Mr. Krabs:, ChefBob, you are hereby fired! ,[punches ChefBob to the floor], Mr. Squidward, will you do the honors?
,[Squidward holds up a hand puppet version of himself.],
,Hand puppet Squidward:, ,[picks up ChefBob], Let me help you slip into something more comfortable. Like the gutter!
,[Squidward kicks ChefBob out the door. ChefBob gets run over by a boat, trampled on by a little girl's pogo stick, and swept away by a street cleaner.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], I learned a very valuable lesson today.
,Hand puppet Mr. Krabs:, To always be yourself and not hide behind a puppet?
,SpongeBob:, Well, yeah, that, but ,[holds up his swollen hand], mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer. ,[his hand thumps],
,[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs all share a laugh together.],
,SpongeBob:, Ow.
,[The scene changes to the next day. Squidward screams at something on the television.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[overlapping], What is it, Squidward?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[overlapping], What is it, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, It's—it's alive! ,[points to the television],
,TV Announcer:, And now, it's time for the ChefBob Cooking with Insults Show! And here's your host, ChefBob!
,ChefBob:, Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
,[The live action audience cheers.],
,ChefBob:, Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
,[The live action audience cheer once more.],
,ChefBob:, Yay, yeah! Yay, yeah!
,[SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are completely shocked and they all faint to the floor. The curtains close and the words ""The End"" appear on the screen, ending the episode.],

"[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is reading a catalog with his snail, Gary.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, take a look a this, Gare Bear. Found a slime ball in your shoe? Even purebred snails call fall victim to the scourge of slime balls. ,[puts the catalog on the table and flips his glasses in his head],
,[Gary hacks and spits out a slime ball. SpongeBob catches the slime ball with a catcher's mitt.],
,SpongeBob:, You really got some air on that one.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I know that meow. That says, ""I'm hungry."" ,[flips his chair over to reveal Gary's food bowl], Lucky for you, I speak fluent snail. ,[sticks out a can of snail food from his mouth and dumps some food in Gary's bowl],
,Gary:, ,[pouts], Meow!
,SpongeBob:, What, you're not hungry?
,Gary:, ,[kicks the food bowl in SpongeBob's face], Meow-meow!
,SpongeBob:, ,[whips the food off with his nose], Oh, of course. ,[opens his face and pulls out a leash], You wanna go for a walk? ,[closes his face], Gary, you really need to work on your pronunciation.
,[SpongeBob goes to put the leash on Gary. But Gary backs away. SpongeBob tries again, but fails. Then the two start a brawl, which ended with SpongeBob getting tangled in the leash.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, no walkies. ,[pulls the leash off],
,[Gary angrily meows at SpongeBob and pushes him against the table. The catalog falls off the table.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, if only you could talk like a real person. ,[Gary points at something in the catalog], Huh? Ooh! ,[reads], ""The chatterbox translation collar? Know what your best friend is saying!"" A snail translator! That's a great idea, Gary. ,[picks up the phone and calls the chatterbox salesman],
,Chatterbox salesperson:, ,[filing her nails], Chatterbox order line.
,SpongeBob:, Hello, yes, could you please send me one chatterbox snail collar?
,Chatterbox salesperson:, Do you want regular, express, or our fastest delivery option time warp?
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, time warp, please!
,Chatterbox salesperson:, Very well, your package was delivered last Thursday.
,[SpongeBob hangs up the phone, turns around, and gasps as he sees a huge box in the middle of the floor.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I wonder where this came from.
,[Gary slithers off the box and SpongeBob opens it. He dumps out the styrofoam, which is formed into a cube. He touches it and styrofoam explodes in his face. SpongeBob inhales the styrofoam and holds up the new translation collar.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, here we go. ,[puts the collar on Gary's shell], Okay, Gary, speak to me.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Check, check. ,[Gary meows], One, two. Ah, that's more like it. Hello, there, Papa Bob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[tears up], Papa Bob. Oh! Oh, Gary, now you can express you innermost thoughts in language I can understand. ,[holds up diary], I have so many questions.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Lay 'em on me, Papa Bob.
,SpongeBob:, What do you dream about?
,[As Gary explains, he is shown flying in the sky with jellyfish.],
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Mostly, I dream of flying above it all...
,SpongeBob:, Aww, that's sweet.
,Gary's collar:, While I breathe fiery destruction upon my enemies.
,[Gary breathes fire on the town of Bikini Bottom and the townspeople scream and run in terror. The vision ends and SpongeBob gets very scared.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gulps], Hey, if you're gonna dream, dream big, right? ,[clears throat], Let's move on to question two, shall we? What are your long-term goals?
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], To finish restoring my hotrod.
,[Gary's hotrod is shown sputtering and firing up its engines. One tail pipe falls off.],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, you need to get on that. But what I really want to know is, ,[turns upside-down and shakes his butt], how do I look in these pants?
,[Gary's eyes look squared until he shakes his head.],
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], They really bring out the sharp corners of your buttocks.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary, you flatterer. Come on, Gare, let's show Patrick your new voice. ,[meets up with Patrick outside], Oh, Patrick, I have got a surprise for you! ,[laughs], Say hello to Gary.
,Patrick:, ,[shakes Gary's eyestalk], Hello, Gary.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Hello, stinky man.
,Patrick:, Hmm? Hmm. ,[smells his really stinky armpit and his head melts], Phew! Ooh, you're right, Gary, I am ripe! ,[grabs a trashcan and dumps garbage onto himself], Ah, much better.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary sniffs and meows], Delightfully disgusting.
,Patrick:, Thank you, my good man.
,[The scene changes to Sandy leaving the Bikini Bottom Dentist Office.],
,Sandy:, Thanks for the old tooth scrubbing! Bye!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! Gary has a new translating collar.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Hello, hairy astronaut lady.
,Sandy:, How do you do, little fella? ,[pets Gary],
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], You know, same shell, different day.
,SpongeBob:, Isn't it amazing?
,Sandy:, Aww, that ain't nothing. I invented a nut translator ages ago. ,[puts a nut translator on a walnut],
,Walnut:, ,[through nut translator], The pistachios are all out to get me. You can't trust 'em. They're working for the peanut mafia!
,Sandy:, ,[laughs], Walnuts are extra nutty.
,[The scene changes to Squidward meditating in his house.],
,Squidward:, Om.
,Master Marty:, ,[on television], In order to achieve complete brainfulness, one must clear one's mind of all distractions.
,[The doorbell rings.],
,Master Marty:, ,[on television], Distractions are only in your mind.
,[The doorbell continues to ring and Squidward grumbles.],
,Master Marty:, ,[on television], You are the center of the universe.
,[The doorbell rings again.],
,Squidward:, Center of the universe.
,[The doorbell continues to ring and Squidward grumbles.],
,Master Marty:, ,[pops out of the TV], Will you answer the door already?!
,[SpongeBob continues to ring the doorbell until Squidward answers.],
,SpongeBob:, I think your doorbell's broken, Squidward.
,Squidward:, What do you want?
,SpongeBob:, I thought you might want to chat with your neighbor.
,Squidward:, Why would I want to talk to you?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, not to me. ,[holds up Gary], To Gary.
,Squidward:, Oh, good grief. SpongeBob, Gary can't talk. He's a snail!
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Greetings and salutations, grouchy man.
,Squidward:, Wha-ha?
,SpongeBob:, I bought Gary the new pet translator collar.
,Squidward:, Why would you want to talk to him?
,SpongeBob:, Who wouldn't want to talk to their pet?
,Squidward:, I was talking to Gary.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows and enters Squidward's house], Oh. Those walls! That carpet.
,SpongeBob:, Turns out Gary has a very sophisticated sense of design.
,Squidward:, Really? ,[slams the door in SpongeBob's face], Well, maybe I'll give him a guided tour.
,[SpongeBob flips himself over to the other side of the door and falls into Squidward's floor.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, wait up!
,[Squidward leads Gary upstairs in his painting gallery.],
,Squidward:, And up here, you'll find my true masterworks. Hidden away from the eyes of the undeserving public.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Ah, the naïve cephalopod style. Not very sophisticated.
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[grumbles as his face turns red], See here.
,[Gary looks through Squidward's closet and SpongeBob takes notes on Gary's thoughts.],
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Ugh! Tacky.
,Squidward:, Hold on now!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward, I'm taking notes for you. ,[Squidward whacks the notebook out of SpongeBob's hand],
,Master Marty:, ,[on television], Fell the plainfulness flow through you.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], You watch this nonsense?
,Squidward:, What? What's wrong with it?
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Nothing, I'm sure. Apparently, no brain required. Come, Papa Bob. Let's get out of here before this bad taste rubs off on us.
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, gee, do you have to?
,SpongeBob:, Don't be sad, Squidward, we'll be back soon.
,[SpongeBob and Gary head out the door and Squidward grumbles in anger.],
,Master Marty:, ,[on television], Until next time, remember to free yourself from all distraction. ,[vanishes],
,Squidward:, ,[grins evilly], Oh, I will. ,[snickers],
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob getting ready for bed.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[yawns], Night, Gare Bear.
,Gary's collar:, ,[Gary meows], Good night, Papa Bob.
,[SpongeBob claps his hands and the lights turn off. As SpongeBob and Gary sleep, Squidward is on the ceiling watching from above.],
,Squidward:, Good night. ,[slides down the wall with his suction cups and sneaks up on a sleeping Gary], Now, let's see if SpongeBob still wants you to talk after tonight. ,[steals the translator collar, takes out a fake one with a walkie-talkie on it, and slips it on to Gary's shell],
,[Squidward snickers evilly and exits SpongeBob's room through the window. As he gets to the ground, he steps on a rake and gets smacked in the face with it.],
,Squidward:, ,[screams and pulls the rake off his face], Stupid rake! ,[speaks through walkie-talkie], Oh, Papa Bob. ,[clears throat], No, no, no. ,[clears throat and talks in a snooty voice], Oh, Papa Bob. ,[Gary's still sleeping], I'm thirsty.
,SpongeBob:, ,[moans], At this hour? All right, I'll get you some water. ,[slides off his bed and rolls to the bathroom; then comes back with a glass of water], Here you go, buddy, one water. ,[places it in Gary's bowl and prepares to go back to bed],
,Squidward:, ,[through walkie-talkie], I want to go to the park.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? Oh, sure. No problem, Gary. ,[yelps as he tries to stay awake],
,[SpongeBob falls over, puts Gary on his back and slithers to the front door. Moments later, SpongeBob and Gary, still half-asleep, comes back from their walk.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that was fun. ,[puts Gary in his bed and prepares himself to go to sleep],
,Squidward:, ,[through walkie-talkie], My bed is too lumpy.
,SpongeBob:, All right, then. ,[slips off his bed again and picks up Gary], Here, Gary, take my bed, hmm? ,[puts Gary on his bed and goes to sleep on the floor],
,Squidward:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Papa Bob, it's hot in here. ,[snickers],
,[SpongeBob opens his bedroom window.],
,Squidward:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Still too stuffy.
,SpongeBob:, Still too— ,[takes out a sledge hammer and pounds a hole on the wall; the wind blows in], How's that, Gary?
,Squidward:, ,[through walkie-talkie], The view is so much nicer a block away.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, okay.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob lifting his house up with a jackscrew and putting wheels on it.],
,SpongeBob:, This should get things rolling. ,[kicks the jackscrew out from under the house and pushes it out onto the road],
,Squidward:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Keep going. Just a little more. ,[snickers and looks through binoculars], Perfect.
,[SpongeBob stops on a hill and is completely exhausted.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps as he sees a comet flying across the sky], You're right, Gary. The view is nicer over here. Gary? ,[sees his house rolling down the hill], Gary! ,[screams],
,[SpongeBob's house rolls down into Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob chases after his house and clings onto the lower window. He opens his front door and climbs back inside. The house rolls down the road and runs through a red light, which also causes pile-ups. The house crashes into several buildings. SpongeBob screams as he sees danger signs about a steep cliff the house is heading to. SpongeBob jumps out through the hole and slows the house down with his shoes.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[his shoes ignite and burn, making him barefooted], Whoa! ,[screams], Oh-whoa-oh! Oh, god! Oh, god! ,[whimpers as he clings onto his house],
,[The house stops slowly and dangles over the cliff. SpongeBob clings onto the front wheel and pulls himself to safety on the cliff.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew! Aww, that was close, huh, Gary? ,[he accidentally leans onto his house and it rolls off the cliff], Oops.
,[SpongeBob's house rolls far out into the distance. The scene changes to the next morning. SpongeBob and Gary are deeply upset that their house is gone, leaving them nothing but a dirt circle on the ground.],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, now where are we gonna sleep? ,[sobs],
,[Squidward snicks as he pulls up a brick wall.],
,Squidward:, ,[through walkie-talkie], You could always live in a hole, like that idiot sea star.
,[As SpongeBob continues to cry, Gary discovers the fake collar on his shell. He looks around.],
,Gary:, Meow?
,[Gary discovers Squidward laughing to himself behind the wall, holding a walkie-talkie. He glares at Squidward and sees a sobbing SpongeBob digging a hole. At that instant, Gary realizes that  Squidward is responsible for the loss of SpongeBob's house and growls angrily at him. Gary decides to teach Squidward a lesson and slithers over to him. As Squidward continues to laugh, Gary pulls to fake collar back and launches it into Squidward's mouth, making him choke on it and then swallow it. Gary then meows through the walkie-talkie to make Squidward sound like a snail. SpongeBob digs deeper in the hole as his house suddenly appears above him and rolls back into place. The house falls on SpongeBob and he comes out through the door.],
,SpongeBob:, My house! Oh, Squidward, we're neighbors again. ,[hugs Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[pulls SpongeBob off], Get off of—
,Gary:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Meow.
,[Squidward covers his mouth.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, I didn't catch that, Squidward, what'd you say?
,Squidward:, I said, ""Get off of""—
,Gary:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Meow.
,[Gary continues to meow through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body until it attracts the attention of a pedestrian with his worm. The worm growls, barks and runs over to Squidward.],
,Nat Peterson:, Hey!
,[Squidward becomes scared and runs away as Gary meows through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body.],
,Nat Peterson:, Hey! Come back with my worm!
,[Squidward runs into the pet park with several angry worms following after him. As Gary continues to meow through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body, Squidward gets himself cornered by the worms. Gary hisses through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body. All of the worms pile up on Squidward and begin to maul on him.],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, looks like Squidward wants a pet of his own to talk to.
,Gary:, ,[smooth voice], Meow. ,[laughs and smiles],

,Mr. Krabs:, What are you talking about?

,Squidward:, But...but, I..I...I...I...
,Squidward and SpongeBob:, ,[get kicked out of lodge],
,Squidward:, I can't believe it. They kicked me out of the Cephalopod Lodge.
,SpongeBob:, Do we get to join the lodge?
,Squidward:, Were you dropped on your head when you were a baby?
,SpongeBob:, Huh! How did you know?
,Squidward:, Psychic powers. Hey! Where's Patrick?
,SpongeBob:, Maybe he got to join the lodge!
,Patrick:, ,[falls out of the sky and crushes Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either?
,Patrick:, Nah. I found the institution had nothing of to offer me. I was stagnating.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, where's Squidward?
,Patrick:, Hold on. ,[shakes right leg. Nothing happens. shakes left leg],
,Squidward:, ,[head pops out of Patrick's shorts],
,Patrick:, Found Squidward. ,[pulls Squidward out of his shorts. Then, pulls the hat out and puts it on Squidward's head],
,Squidward:, The last thing in my life I really enjoyed. And SpongeBob ruined it, too.
,Patrick:, Well, at least you still have the hat.
,Squidward:, Yeah. ,[sniffles], I do, don't I?
,Brother Roger:, Eh, hem. ,[takes Squidward's hat],
,SpongeBob:, You still have your robes.
,Brother Roger:, ,[takes Squidward's robes],
,Patrick:, You still have your underwear.
,Brother Roger:, ,[takes Squidward's underwear],
,Squidward:, No!
,SpongeBob:, ,[covers his own eyes and Patrick's],
,Squidward:, ,[pulls on his regular shirt], You can look now.
,SpongeBob:, Don't you worry, Squidward. I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in.
,[knocks on Cephalopod Lodge door],
,Brother Roger:, What is it? Oh, it’s you two.
,SpongeBob:, We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge. So, it's not his fault.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Not his fault.
,Brother Roger:, Then who's fault was it?
,Patrick:, Was it my fault?
,SpongeBob:, No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Thanks, SpongeBob. And it wasn't your fault either.
,Brother Roger:, Well, if it wasn't your fault, and it wasn't Squidward's fault, who's fault was it?
,Patrick:, Uh... maybe it's your fault.
,Brother Roger:, Squidward is never allowed in this lodge again!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! Are they letting me back in the lodge?!
,SpongeBob:, No. You can't set foot in the lodge.
,Patrick:, Ever!
,Squidward:, Oh. Now that you two have ruined the last good thing in my life,...I think I'll go slam my head in the door. Repeatedly.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, wait! I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
,Squidward:, No. Why didn't you just make up your own dumb club instead of ruining mine?
,SpongeBob:, That's it! ,[jumps on Squidward], Squidward! We'll make our own club! And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge! And you can be our leader! How great does that sound, O Mighty One?! Wanna join our club, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Dog-pile on Squidward!
,Squidward:, Aaahhhh! ,[The three walk back home],.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, you're the lodge expert. What do we do first?
,Squidward:, Say goodbye. ,[enters his house],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Goodbye!
,Squidward:, Morons.
,SpongeBob:, ,[climbs in through Squidward's window], So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation.
,Patrick:, ,[falls through Squidward's window], Hey.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake.
,Patrick:, Secret!
,SpongeBob:, ,[claps hands over head],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Patty-cake, patty-cake, sailor man! Bake me a cake as fast...
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! That's not a secret hand-shake! Everybody knows Patty-cake!
,SpongeBob:, Not the way we do it.
,Patrick:, We don't use our pinkies.
,Squidward:, ,[pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his house], Out!
,Patrick:, I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push. ,[knocks on Squidward's door],
,Squidward:, Oh, what now? I'm coming! What do you... Great. Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks.
,SpongeBob:, ,[traps Squidward in a light brown bag], Let's move. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick carry the bag away],
,They arrive at Jellyfish Fields.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, we can let him out now.
,Squidward:, Are you insane? You kidnapped me?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for...
,Patrick:, Initiation.
,Squidward:, What? What kind of initiation?
,SpongeBob:, A very special initiation. ,[pulls a jellyfish out of his net],
,Squidward:, Oh, boy. Look at the time! Gotta run.
,Patrick:, ,[smashes Squidward to the ground],
,SpongeBob:, Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?
,Patrick:, After you, Brother SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[flicks the jellyfish and puts it on his tongue], Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow! ,[gibberish], Brother Patrick?
,Patrick:, Brother SpongeBob. ,[slaps the jellyfish and puts it on his tongue], Aaahhhh! ,[gibberish], Brother Squidward? ,[pulls Squidward's tongue and puts the jellyfish on it],
,Squidward:, ,[jumps into the air], Eee-aahhhhhhh!
,The next morning, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are all back at home.
,Unknown person:, ,[knocks on Squidward's door],
,Squidward:, What's this? Can it be? My lodge robes! I'm back in the lodge! I gotta try 'em on! ,[He comes out of his room, dressed in a chicken suit], Huh? This can't be right! These aren't my cephalopod robes!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[giggling. They are in chicken suits, too.],
,SpongeBob:, They sure aren't. They're your uniform for your new lodge! Welcome to the first official meeting of...The Feather Friends.
,Squidward:, Feather Friends?
,SpongeBob:, Somebody already had Feather Buddies.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley.
,Squidward:, Grrrr. ,[rips his chicken suit in half], I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?
,Squidward:, Grrr...no.
,SpongeBob:, Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it. ,[takes off his chicken suit], Everything we need is in this drawer. ,[pulls Squidward's sock out of the drawer],
,Squidward:, A sock?
,SpongeBob:, Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll have to let you back in the lodge!
,Patrick:, Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan.
,Squidward:, One flaw?
,Patrick:, That sock is way too small.
,SpongeBob:, It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery. ,[grabs a giant sock],
,Patrick:, That's what I'm talkin' about!
,It is night time at the Cephalopod Lodge.
,Albino eel (SpongeBob):, Okay, Squidward. Just give us five minutes and then do your stuff.
,Albino eel (SpongeBob and Patrick):, ,[walk to the lodge],
,Squidward:, Huh.
,Narrator:, 5 minutes later...
,Squidward:, ,[walks to the lodge], This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a..a....giant albino eel!

,Patrick:, Roooo!
,SpongeBob:, Roar!
,Lodge members:, ,[screaming and running],
,Patrick:, Roo!
,SpongeBob:, Roar!
,Squidward:, Unbelievable.
,Lodge member:, Squidward!
,Brother Roger:, Look out!
,Lodge member:, There's a giant albino eel on the loose!
,Squidward:, ,[clears throat], Do not worry. I will save you. Be gone, foul beast, or, I will smite thee. ,[punches the sock twice],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Oh! Oh, ow! Ow! Oof! ,[sock flattens and collapses],
,Lodge members:, ,[cheering], Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[laughing],

"[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick taking a nature hike in the Kelp Forest.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, this grass feels great between my toes. Hey, Patrick, are you enjoying our early morning nature hike?
,[Patrick yawns, falls over and drags himself over to SpongeBob. He gets up with grass all over his body.],
,Patrick:, It's cutting into my early morning nature nap. ,[falls over and shakes the grass off],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Patrick. If you want to stay healthy, you have to embrace nature!
,Patrick:, Okay!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick skip happily into an ice cave.],
,Both:, Ooh!
,SpongeBob:, Cool ice cave!
,Patrick:, Ohhhhhhh... ,[walks over to a block of ice], This whole place is a frozen treat! ,[licks the ice],
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick! Don't lick the ice, you're gonna get stuck!
,Patrick:, Uh. Now he tells me. ,[cries and struggles to free himself],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick. Everything is going to be fine. Just don't panic.
,[Patrick screams in panic and wraps his tongue around a stalagmite. However, his tongue pulls him back and he slams into the ice.],
,Patrick:, I panicked, SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob digs into his backpack and pulls out a cup of hot chocolate.],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry! Hot chocolate solves everything.
,[SpongeBob pours hot chocolate on Patrick's tongue, burning it.],
,Patrick:, ,[screams and pulls his tongue off the ice], Hot! Hot! Hot! ,[grabs a rock and smashes his tongue], Hot! Agh! ,[sighs],
,[Patrick's tongue is now burnt and bruised. Patrick faints and falls asleep. SpongeBob puts his hot chocolate in his backpack. But unbeknownst to him, the hot chocolate completely melts the ice, revealing a cave sponge from within. The cave sponge wakes up and emerges from the ice.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Uh...?
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick. That's enough nature for you today.
,[SpongeBob pulls out his shoes from his backpack and puts them on. He does a little warm up with his feet and shoes. The cave sponge is sniffing around and takes notice of SpongeBob's shoes. He immediately becomes fascinated by the squeaking noises SpongeBob's shoes make.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Oh? Ah. ,[purring], Squeaky, squeaky!
,[SpongeBob grabs Patrick's tongue and drags the sleeping Patrick out of the ice cave. The cave sponge starts following SpongeBob and stows away into his backpack.],
,Spongy Spongy:, ,[purrs], Mehh.
,[SpongeBob drags Patrick to his house and ties his tongue on a rack like a horse.],
,SpongeBob:, See ya later, Patrick. ,[leaves Patrick and enters his own house], Gary, I'm home! ,[takes off his backpack and hangs it on the coat hanger], Boy, this backpack got heavy.
,[SpongeBob leaves. The coat hanger bends over and breaks.],
,Gary:, Meow!
,[The cave sponge climbs out of SpongeBob's backpack and sniffs around.],
,Gary:, Meow.
,[The cave sponge sniffs Gary and sees SpongeBob walking with his squeaking shoes.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Ah!
,[The cave sponge follows SpongeBob upstairs to the bathroom where SpongeBob is taking a shower. He sneaks into the bathroom and hides in the sink. SpongeBob, who is now wearing a bathrobe and shower cap, walks up to the sink and sticks his tongue out. The cave sponge sticks his tongue out as well, but his tongue has hair on it.],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, those nature hikes really put hair on my tongue.
,[The cave sponge climbs out of the sink and follows SpongeBob to his clothe-changing machine. SpongeBob activates the machine with his nose and it removes his shower cap and bathrobe. It then dresses SpongeBob in his regular pants and shoes and gives him his Krusty Krab working hat. SpongeBob leaves and the cave sponge pulls the button off the wall, causing the machine to go haywire. The machine removes the cave sponge's loincloth and dresses him in SpongeBob's pants.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Agh-agh-agh!
,[The machine goes to put SpongeBob's shoes on the cave sponge's feet.],
,Spongy Spongy:, ,[panting], Squeaky! Squeaky! ,[happily grunts],
,[The machine puts the shoes on the cave sponge's feet, but they were too small and they both rip through.],
,Spongy Spongy:, ,[groans], No squeaky.
,[The machine gives the cave sponge the Krusty Krab working hat and the cave sponge leaves.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm on my way to work, Gary. See ya tonight!,[leaves],

,Gary:, Meow?

,Spongy Spongy:, ,[happy chuckling], Squeaky! Squeaky! ,[happy grunts],
,[The cave sponge waves his arms back and forth as he follows SpongeBob. However, in doing so, he accidentally destroys a mailbox.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[hums and picks up a stick], Ah! ,[drags the stick against the fence],
,[The cave sponge attempts to imitate SpongeBob's tactic. However, he ends up destroying the fence. SpongeBob swings on a nearby fountain. The cave sponge does the same thing, but ends up destroying the fountain. The cave sponge follows SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab.],
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, Squidward!
,Squidward:, It was. ,[gets punched in the face by the cave sponge], Agh! ,[falls backwards],
,[SpongeBob and the cave sponge enter the kitchen. The cave sponge goes to sniff around while SpongeBob prepares to make relish.],
,SpongeBob:, I do relish... ,[pulls out a jar of pickles], making the relish!
,[SpongeBob pours pickles in the blender. Then he pours vinegar and grease in the blender and begins mixing them together. The cave sponge is frightened by the blender and hides himself behind several pots and pans  above the condiment table.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! ,[louder], ,SpongeBob!,
,SpongeBob:, ,Yes, Mr. Krabs?!, You called me?
,Mr. Krabs:, Can you step into the dining room for one moment, son?
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps out of the kitchen], Huah! Wha-wha-wha-wha-huah! Front and center, and ready for duty, sir! ,[gasps as he sees the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant with Ivy and his smashed-up mailbox],
,Ivy:, That's the man who smashed my mailbox, officer!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well?
,SpongeBob:, No, Mr. Krabs, I'd never do something like that!
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course you wouldn't! It's just this loser's word against yours, boy-o. They can't convict you for that.
,SpongeBob:, Phew.
,Evelyn:, He ruined my fountain!
,Cara:, Yeah, yeah! That's the guy!
,Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant:, Mr. SquarePants, I'm afraid you're under arrest. ,[cuffs SpongeBob and drags him out of the restaurant],
,SpongeBob:, But—but, Mr. Krabs, I didn't do anything. I was framed! It wasn't me! ,[screams],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry, boy-o! I'm right behind you! ,[kicks Squidward's cashier boat], Look alive, Mr. Squidward! ,[Squidward gets up], I'm gonna visit SpongeBob in the big house. You are manning the grill! ,[grabs Squidward and shoves him through the kitchen window],
,Squidward:, ,[yelling], Ow! ,[grumbles as he gets up and puts his hat on],
,[The cave sponge observes Squidward as he begins flipping a Krabby Patty.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Ah? ,[growls], Agh! ,[takes a bite of the patty and falls on top of Squidward with the pots and pans],
,Squidward:, They let you out already? Ugh, you look terrible, SpongeBob! ,[the cave sponge groans], Well, get the food ready. It's almost time for lunch! ,[leaves],
,Spongy Spongy:, Food? ,[chuckles],
,[The cave sponge grabs a spatula and a mop and make them into a spear. He jumps in the air and lets out a war cry.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Agh! ,[stabs the ketchup bottle with his spear and gets ketchup on his face; he grunts],
,[The cave sponge smears ketchup on his left eye as if he is making his mark. The scene changes to the cave sponge hiding behind some garbage cans behind the Krusty Krab. He sees Frankie billy pulling up to the restaurant with his boat. The cave sponge jumps out and lets out a war cry. He jumps on the boat stabs it with his spear, rips open the hood, pulls out the motor, and drinks the oil. He lets out a victory yell and runs back in the restaurant with the motor. Frankie Billy, who is stunned at what he saw, locks the passenger door. The cave sponge places the motor on the grill, puts buns on it and smashes it into pieces with his club. He makes a sandwich and just as he goes to take a bite, Squidward takes it.],
,Squidward:, Well, it's about time! ,[takes the motor parts and goes to serve the ""food"" to the customers],
,[Fred goes to bite his sandwich, but his teeth shatter. Abigail takes a bite of her sandwich, but burns her tongue. Gus takes a bite of his sandwich, but chokes on a tire. He spits out the tire and it hits Tom in the face, leaving him marks. The customers are angry and begin a riot against Squidward.],
,Customers:, This is ridiculous! Is this a restaurant or a garage?
,[The customers grab Squidward and throw him into the kitchen.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Huh?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what did you do? The patties taste horrible! Everybody hates them!
,Spongy Spongy:, Unh... ,[growls and pulls out his club],
,Squidward:, What the— ,[screams in panic and runs out of the kitchen], SpongeBob's gone crazy! Run for your lives!
,Spongy Spongy:, ,[grunts], Spongy! Spongy! ,[growls as he smashes the tables],
,[The customers run out and scream in panic. The cave sponge whacks Nat Peterson's buttocks with his club and goes on a violent rampage across town, causing all sorts of damage in the process.],
,Perch Perkins:, This is Perch Perkins live at the Krusty Krab, where we understand that a local fry cook has just gone nuts.
,[The cave sponge smashes the Krusty Krab sign with his club. The sign falls on top of the restaurant, causing damage to it.],
,Perch Perkins:, ,[gets whacked in the head by the cave sponge], Ooh! This just in... Ow!
,[Meanwhile, at Bikini Bottom Jail, Mr. Krabs goes to visit SpongeBob. SpongeBob picks up the phone to talk to Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Why did you have to go nuts on company time, boy-o? I'm gonna lose so much money.
,SpongeBob:, I didn't go nuts, Mr. Krabs. They must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm innocent! ,[taps his squeaky shoe],
,[Outside the prison, the cave sponge hears SpongeBob's squeaky shoes.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Oh? Squeaky, squeaky? ,[growls as he smashes the fence with his club],
,Mr. Krabs:, Save it for the judge, boy-o. Come clean! Nobody else even looks like you!
,[Suddenly, the cave sponge bursts through the wall with his club, crushing the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant in the process, catching SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs' attention.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[seeing the cave sponge], Except that guy.
,[The cave sponge wonders around, as SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs watch him and he jumps on the counter and smashes the window, crushing Mr. Krabs underneath. Officer Rob Johnson comes in and is cornered by the cave sponge.],
,Spongy Spongy:, ,[growls], Squeaky, squeaky! Squeaky, squeaky!
,Perch Perkins:, Local scientists now believe that the rampaging fry cook is actually a prehistoric ""cave sponge,"" once thought to be extinct.
,Officer Rob Johnson:, Ah! Get him off!
,SpongeBob:, See? I didn't destroy any property! It was that cave sponge!
,[The cave sponge drags Officer Rob Johnson, sniffs him, and licks his head.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw. He's just lost and scared. He just needs another sponge to talk to.
,[The cave sponge runs away.],
,Perch Perkins:, Shortly thereafter, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob went to City Hall to confront the wild beast.
,Mr. Krabs:, We did?
,[The scene changes to the police officers and the Bikini Bottomites cornering the cave sponge at City Hall. The cave sponge throws a chuck of the roof to the police officers.],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, officer. I'm a fellow sponge. He'll listen to me.
,[SpongeBob catapults himself in the air and tackles the cave sponge to the top of the roof.],
,Spongy Spongy:, Unh? ,[sniffs],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh? ,[giggles and sniffs], SpongeBob. SpongeBob! ,[gives the cave sponge a light punch on the chest],
,Spongy Spongy:, Unh. Spongy Spongy. ,[punches SpongeBob in the face],
,SpongeBob:, Oof! Now we're getting somewhere! Sooo...can you please go downstairs now and turn yourself in to the police?
,[Spongy Spongy walks to the edge, looks down and sees the police.],
,Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant:, Hello!
,[Spongy Spongy growls in confusion.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Spongy Spongy, I respect that. I'll leave you alone. ,[walks away],
,Spongy Spongy:, ,[growls], Uh. ,[happily grunts and follows SpongeBob], Oh! Squeaky, squeaky!
,[SpongeBob realizes that Spongy Spongy likes the squeaky sounds his shoes make.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you like that, huh? ,[squeaks his shoes], Ah!
,[Spongy Spongy imitates his movements. As SpongeBob and Spongy Spongy start to dance, the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant pulls out two canes and hats and throws them up to them. The two sponges, past and present, put on a show on the rooftop and dance the night away. The police officer dance along as well. During the show, Spongy Spongy continues to imitate SpongeBob's dancing movements. SpongeBob's shoes come off and Spongy Spongy's feet come off and they both dance as well. The two sponges finish the show and everyone on the ground gives them a round of applause. Spongy Spongy swipes SpongeBob's shoes and goes to try them on. However, since his feet are too big and the shoes are too small, he growls in frustration and stomps on the roof.],
,SpongeBob:, Spongy Spongy, wait! Wahh!
,[But it was too late. The City Hall's roof cracks and the building collapses to the ground. The police and Mr. Krabs walk up to SpongeBob and Spongy Spongy.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I talked him down. Hooray. Oh, please don't put Spongy Spongy in jail!
,Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant:, Nobody's gonna put him in jail son. He just saved the town millions by demolishing City Hall. It was due to come down next week.
,SpongeBob:, Ah! Spongy Spongy is free!
,Spongy Spongy:, ,[grunts as he walks around upside down with SpongeBob's shoes in his hands], Spongy Spongy. Spongy Spongy!
,Perch Perkins:, And so, the savage beast finally soothed, life in Bikini Bottom returns to normal...if only for this episode. This is Perch Perkins—,[gets whacked in the head by Spongy Spongy's club], Ow! ,[groans], For Bikini Bottom News.
,[Spongy Spongy looks at the camera, sniffs it and smashes it with his club, leaving a crack on the screen. The camera falls over and Spongy Spongy looks at it, ending the episode.],

,Mr. Krabs:, He's over there! Stop him!
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], I can't help it. I'm a kleptomaniac!
,[Mr. Krabs nearly catches him, but Plankton dodges him. Plankton keeps running away with the formula until he bumps into someone.],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Ow!
,[Plankton pulls himself off, accidentally losing his eyeball and teeth. He puts his eyeball back in his face, looks up and sees a female police officer.],
,Police Officer:, You're under arrest!

,Patrick:, ,[gets up and groans], No, sir, I couldn't eat another.
,[Patrick drunkenly stumbles over to Plankton's cell.],

,Plankton:, Not exactly the blanket I wanted.
,[Meanwhile in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are wondering around the streets in their police uniforms.],
,SpongeBob:, Isn't it a crime to impersonate a police officer?
,Mr. Krabs:, We're not impersonating, boy-o. I was in the navy, and the navy is sort of like the cops...of the sea. And I just deputized you. ,[whacks SpongeBob with the club],
,SpongeBob:, Deput—wow! I always wanted to be an officer of the law! Check it out. ,[rubs his chin], I'm the fuzz.

,SpongeBob:, Let me handle this, Officer Mr. Krabs! Well, missy, do ya?
,Helen the Felon:, I don't have a license.
,SpongeBob:, ,[cuffs the little girl], Yeah, that's what I thought. You're under arrest for violating penal code 4968973025-D.
,Mr. Krabs:, How did you know that?

,[Helen the Felon is taken to the interrogation room and SpongeBob turns on the light.],
,Mr. Krabs:, While I look for the formula, you can interrogate the suspect.
,SpongeBob:, But I don't know how to interrogate.
,Mr. Krabs:, Then just ask questions. ,[pushes SpongeBob in the room], And act tough. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Um...questions and act tough. Got it. ,[goes to the table and pulls the chair], Hmm... ,[sits down], Okay, little Helen! ,[inhales and buffs up his body], What do you think of this weather?

,Patrick's stomach:, Frozen treats.
,Patrick:, ,[jumps off the bed], Huh! I'm gonna have to make myself some jailhouse ice cream. ,[puts a band on his hand],
,[Patrick grabs a bunch of toilet paper and stuffs them down the toilet. He pulls his underwear out and stuffs it in the toilet too. He squirts a tube of toothpaste, adds a cinderblock, and stuffs them all down with his foot. He grabs a scooper, scoops some green ice cream out and puts it on a cone made out of magazine. He takes a taste and he likes it.],
,Patrick:, Try it! You can't even tell the difference.
,[A close-up of the ice cream is shown.],
,Plankton:, Blech! No, thanks. But, say, I know where they keep the real ice cream around here: in the evidence room. A guy like you who knows his way around here might be able—
,Patrick:, ,[pops a key out from the ice cream], I have a key.
,Plankton:, Oh, really? Let's go!
,[Patrick swallows the key, rubs the ice cream all over his body and slips through the bars. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is searching through the hallway for the evidence room. He stumbles across a room filled with donuts.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Donuts? ,[opens the door and a pile of donuts fall on him], Whoa! ,[pops out], Hm. Well...maybe just one. ,[eats one donut; he turns and sees the door to the evidence room and spits the donut out], Evidence room! ,[goes to the door], Huh? ,[hears something],
,Patrick:, You promised me ice cream! Hmph! ,[sits on the floor and pouts],
,Plankton:, ,[jumps on Patrick's stomach], Look, once I get the secret formula and rule the world, I'll buy you all the ice cream you want! ,[hops over to a shelf filled with various evidence], Let's see. Comic books, sea shells...an old man...

,Plankton:, Outboard motors...stolen jokes...a leg...
,Fred:, ,[off-screen], My leg!
,Plankton:, Hmm? Well, drop a dime on me! There it is! ,[goes to get the formula, but Mr. Krabs takes it before it gets it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no, you don't!
,Plankton:, Krabs? What are you doing here? I stole that formula fair and square!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I'm stealing it back! ,[stuffs the formula under his shirt],
,Plankton:, Oh, no, you not!
,[Plankton throws a sea shell at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs removes the shell and falls over, knocking over boxes of evidence. He comes out, holding an old man.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Hello!
,[Mr. Krabs throws the old man at Plankton, squishing him in the wall.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Hello!
,[Plankton throws the old man back at Mr. Krabs, sending him flying into another shelf. A group of old people fall onto Mr. Krabs.],
,Old people:, Hello!
,Mr. Krabs:, Who's been pinching all these geezers?
,Patrick:, ,[grabs Mr. Krabs], Where's my ice cream? Where's my ice cream? Where—,[hallucinates as he sees Mr. Krabs' eyestalks become two ice cream cones; he gasps], Ohh! Well, there it is. ,[licks Mr. Krabs' eyestalk],
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you doing, you maniac?! Help! Police! ,[screams as he runs],
,[Plankton jumps onto Mr. Krabs and begins a brawl.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What do you think you're—
,[Moments later, Officer John Slugfish comes in the evidence room, eating a donut. He sees Plankton, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick fighting.],
,Officer John Slugfish:, I don't know what you two are doing, but it looks illegal. ,[gets caught in the brawl, but manages to cuff them all up],
,SpongeBob:, ,[comes in wearing cuffs], I have a confession to make!
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob being placed in the same cell with Plankton and Helen the Felon.],
,Officer John Slugfish:, I'll just hold onto this formula till the morning. ,[shuts the cell door],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, but, officer, I have more confessions.
,Officer John Slugfish:, Zip it, kid! I get it. You're a criminal mastermind. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Guilty! Yay!
,Plankton:, Hey, where's Patrick?
,[They see Patrick, covered in ice cream again, all drunk from Goofy Goobers and opens the cell door with the key. Patrick walks over to the toilet, runs over to Plankton, Helen the Felon, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob and falls onto the bed to sleep.],

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gets an idea], Hmm. Future generations, huh?
,[Bubble transition],
,Mr. Krabs:, Welcome to the Krusty Krab Time Capsule Spectacular! That's right! In 50 years, your donated treasures will be honored for future generations to enjoy! ,[to SpongeBob and Squidward], All right, you guys got donations covered, right?
,SpongeBob:, Sir, yes, sir!
,Squidward:, Whatever.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm gonna go ahead and take care of souvenirs!
,[Nat brings a toaster],
,SpongeBob:, The peoples of the future must see this, so they will know how we toasted bread in the before time. So that they can understand the...
,Squidward:, Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee. ,[SpongeBob puts the toaster in the time capsule],
,Mr. Krabs:, And there's your commemorative time capsule key chain. That'll be $49.57.
,Billy:, But, this thing's made out of rusty old paper clips and cardboard!
,Mr. Krabs:, All right. You drive a hard bargain. I'll throw in a coupon for one free ice cube in a purchase of any large cola at the Krusty Krab. What do ya say?
,Billy:, ,[takes coupon], Deal!
,[Mr. Krabs puts the money away in his shell and sighs],
,[Sadie brings a lamp],
,SpongeBob:, What a beautiful lamp, ma'am, so ornate, essential for night time reading.
,Sadie:, Why, thank you, young man!
,Squidward:, No, thank you for completely failing our future generations with your donation. I mean, seriously, ma'am, did you just grab the first thing you saw this morning?
,Sadie:, Well, actually..
,Squidward:, ,[imitates Sadie], ""Hmm. Oh, whatever will I donate to the time capsule? Golly, this is hard! How about ,[gasps], this lamp?! It's ,[sarcastically], perfect!""
,Sadie:, Wow, you're good. How did you know all that? Are you like a psychic? Oh, oh, oh! Tell me what I'm thinking!
,Squidward:, Next. ,[throws the lamp],
,SpongeBob:, ,[catches the lamp in his face], Hey, nice pass, Squidward!
,[Bubble transition; a strange man brings a plate],
,Squidward:, Uh-huh. Tell me, what do you know about this plate?
,Man:, Uh, it works good when I eat stuff.
,Squidward:, Right. This plate is actually ,not, meant to be eaten on. Now with your permission, I'd like to perform a few tests to verify its authenticity.
,Man:, Uh, okay.
,Squidward:, ,[starts teething on plate. Sucks it up his nose and takes it out], Uh-huh. ,[rubs it on his bottom], Interesting. ,[skids around on plate], This is a promising sign. Yep. ,[hits plate on man's head several times], You hear that plate-hitting-skull sound? It's definitely authentic. And I would price it conservatively in today's market at $250.
,Man:, Really?
,Squidward:, No. ,[throws plate away and SpongeBob catches it; he breaths heavily],
,[Bubble transition],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to the plate], You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!
,Squidward:, Next. ,[throws sock],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps. He catches the sock and drops the plate, breaking it], A four-striped sock! Incredible!
,French Narrator:, 2 hours later...
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward. I think that's everyone.
,Patrick:, ,[runs to the time capsule with a rock], SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.
,SpongeBob:, After you then!
,Patrick:, Thank you, my good man.
,Squidward:, Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...? ,[Patrick is gone], What t-..
,Patrick:, Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now.
,Squidward:, Oh, no, you don't! ,[Squidward and Patrick fight over the rock and the rock falls on a wooden floorboard and it catapults SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward into the time capsule, which closes],
,SpongeBob:, You know, that didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would.
,Patrick:, What didn't? Hey, look, a yo-yo! ,[plays with yo-yo],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you're very good at that!
,[Bubble transition],
,Mr. Krabs:, And thanks so much for all your contributions! So, are ya ready to put this thing in the ground?! ,[crowd cheers],
,Plankton:, Ugh! Curse that Krabs and his cheering crowds! Big whoop, a stupid time capsule. ,[blows raspberry],
,Mr. Krabs:, But, before we do, I'd like to make a contribution of my own. A copy of the Krabby Patty formula!
,Plankton:, ,[eye becomes bottle-shaped and antennae snap], There it is! The one element that can turn this lonesome bucket of steel into a bustling world famous eatery! ,[laughs evilly],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[puts the formula in the time capsule], Send her down! ,[the time capsule gets buried],
,SpongeBob:, ,[throws a card in a net], He shoots, he scores!
,Squidward:, ,[shoves SpongeBob off], Get off me! ,[tries to get out],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, whatcha doing?
,Patrick:, Yeah, it looks fun!
,Squidward:, ,WE JUST GOT BURIED ALIVE, YOU IDIOTS!,
,SpongeBob:, I know, but what are you doing?
,[Bubble Transition],
,[everyone cheering],
,Mr. Krabs:, Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry? ,[crowd cheers. Everyone enters the Krusty Krab as Plankton laughs evilly],
,[scene cuts to time capsule],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm. What should we do for the next 50 years?
,Patrick:, I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years.
,Patrick:, ,[shocked], 50 years? What are we gonna do till then?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. We've got 50 years' worth of stuff to play with here! ,[finds a game. He gasps], It's our favorite game!
,Both:, Pretzel Pals!
,Patrick:, Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! ,[lays the game out on Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, yes, now where did we leave off?
,Patrick:, I believe my left hand was on red.
,SpongeBob:, My right foot was on blue.
,Patrick:, Forehead on yellow.
,SpongeBob:, Left foot on green. ,[kicks Squidward in the face. He throws the game off him and on SpongeBob and Patrick,
,Squidward:, That's it, this game is ,over!, ,[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?
,SpongeBob:, Hmmm. ,[SpongeBob imagines his future in a chrome area. He gets out of the time capsule],
,Future Fish:, Welcome to the future, history person. During your absence, our society has achieved numerous advances. We're sure you'll find to be quite impressive. ,[he and SpongeBob get teleported to a water fountain], Well?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Wow, special drinking fountains for short people! What will the future think of next? ,[SpongeBob's future ends],
,Patrick:, Not bad, SpongeBob. Not bad. I dream of a town with the perfect blend of commerce and irrigation. ,[imagines his future in a real city], Not to mention the breathtaking views. ,[Patrick's future ends],
,SpongeBob:, Sounds dreamy, Pat. What do you think the future will be like, Squidward?
,[Squidward imagines his future],
,Future Octopus:, ,[holding up Squidward's painting of him], His artwork embodies the soul that our society has lost. And it is here, ,[the Krusty Krab is shown], the location of the suffering that inspired that art that we place the Squidward Tentacles Memorial Museum! ,[Squidward's house is dropped on top of the Krusty Krab replacing it with the museum; the other octopi cheer],
,[scene transitions to the present with Squidward smiling and giggling],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?
,Plankton:, ,[uses his mining drill and burrows towards the time capsule], Jackpot! And now to ,extract, the secret recipe. ,[the mining drill extends its arms, holding and wedge and hammer], Careful. Careful. ,[the hammer hits the wedge and Squidward gets knocked out],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Sixteen Bikini Bottom, nineteen Bikini Bottom, ,twenty!, Ready or not, here we... ,[they both spot Squidward],
,Patrick:, Nice try, Squidward, but we both already got that hiding spot figured out. ,[finds a can of shaving gel], Whipped cream! ,[eats cream and spits it out], Oh, this whipped cream tastes awful! ,[reads off can], ""Sha-veeng g-el."",[a drill drills through and creates a hole in the can causing the shaving gel to land on Patrick's face], I've always wanted a beard!
,SpongeBob:, Me too! ,[both laugh as SpongeBob sprays shaving gel on his face], Do you want one too, Squidbeard? ,[sprays a beard on Squidward's face],
,Squidward:, ,[wakes up and moans], Wha...? Oh! Has it been 50 years already? ,[looks in the mirror and notices the beard], Yes! I knew I'd still be hot!
,Plankton:, ,[sneaks inside], Secret recipe, where are you? Aha! ,[jumps through the hole],
,Squidward:, Hello, future! ,[escapes through the hole Plankton made and digs up to the surface. He laughs], Yes! Huh? What the...?! Where's my museum? The future is the same as my old pathetic life! Forget this! I'm waiting another 50 years! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick watch as he stomps away],
,Plankton:, Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe! ,[laughs evilly],
,Squidward:, ,[stomps on Plankton, causing him to swallow the bottle], Dig me out when my life doesn't stink.
,[Bubble transition to the Chum Bucket; Plankton is sitting on the toilet grunting],

,Plankton:, Quiet, Karen. Just bring me more prunes.

"[The episode begins at Squidward's house where Squidward takes a really interesting meal he made out of the oven. He adds a bit of lemon juice on it and takes the meal to the table.],
,Squidward:, ,[French accent], I am a culinary genius, no? ,[sets his meal on the table where a wooden mannequin is sitting], Here you are, sir. Ze specialty of mah house. Roast salad à la Squidward. ,[gasps], Sacré bleu! I must apologize, monsieur! I have forgotten the parsley for the garnish. ,[takes his meal back into the oven], Stay warm, my little Squidy. ,[kisses it, but it burns his lips; he shrieks], Le oww! ,[closes the oven and goes outside to his garden], Typical, I always forget something.
,[Squidward prepares to cut some of the parsley, but is pulled down by something.],
,Squidward:, Ugh!
,[Squidward several attempts to pull the parsley out, but gets himself pulled into the ground. Underneath, he sees a sea bunny.],
,Squidward:, A sea bunny? ,[pulls parsley back],
,[The sea bunny pulls Squidward's mustache off of his face.],
,Squidward:, ,[shrieks sharply], Ow!
,[The sea bunny takes the mustache and ties it to his ukulele. He strums the ukulele and plays music while walking away in his tunnel.],
,Squidward:, ,[pulls himself out of the ground, retrieves his chef's hat, and puts it back on], That voracious vermin is ruining my French chef fantasy. ,[stomps on the ground and prepares to walk back in the house], Why—ah! ,[falls in the hole the sea bunny came out from],
,[The sea bunny eats the parsley.],
,Squidward:, Grr! ,[tries to grab the sea bunny, but it pulls his hat down; Squidward goes to take it off, but the sea bunny tickles him], Oh—oh, no, no, no, no! I have a ticklish core! ,[laughs],
,[The sea bunny hops on top of Squidward and goes to ravage the garden. Suddenly, smoke comes out from the back door of his house.],
,Squidward:, Oh. ,[sniffs and opens his eyes],
,[Squidward's house coughs up the smoke and fire breaks out. Squidward pulls himself out of the ground, grabs the hose, and rushes back in the house.],
,Squidward:, My roast à la Squidward!
,[Squidward puts out the fire and carries his meal out. His roast à la Squidward is now burnt to a crisp and Squidward sighs. He sobs over his ruined creation. The sea bunny pops out of the hole and cries with Squidward.],
,Squidward:, What the—,[growls as he goes to kill the sea bunny],
,[The sea bunny grabs the burnt roast à la Squidward and shoves it in Squidward's mouth.],
,Squidward:, Oof! ,[gulps the burnt roast à la Squidward down and starts to feel sick],
,[Squidward runs back in and the sea bunny hops back in his hole. The sea bunny continues to eat Squidward's vegetable garden as he dances to the music ""The Blue Danube"". He continues to enjoy himself until Squidward comes out, wearing a Viking outfit and holding a club.],
,Squidward:, I declare war on bunnies!
,[Squidward runs to his garden and tries to strike the sea bunny with his club, but he ends up destroying his vegetables in the process. The sea bunny holds out a shield and protects himself from Squidward's club. The impact of the shield and the club causes it to get stuck on Squidward's face. Squidward pulls the club off his face and groans at his destroyed garden.],
,Squidward:, ,[growls and screams], I am going to bury that bunny! ,[falls in the hole again],
,[The sea bunny giggles and belches. He buries Squidward in the soil and waters him with a watering can before walking away. Squidward then grows into a plant. Moments later, Patrick walks by and sees Squidward as a plant.],
,Patrick:, ,[gasps, climbs over the fence, and walks over towards Squidward], Wow. That's the ugliest eggplant I've ever seen! I don't think Squidward would mind if I took a little taste. Ooh, come here.
,[Patrick grabs Squidward with his teeth and attempts to pull him off the stem. However, Squidward is completely stuck onto the stem, which causes Patrick to lose his grip and sends him falling into back under his rock. The scene changes to the sea bunny gathering more vegetables in Squidward's garden. He pulls out several vegetables and puts them in the basket. Suddenly, a really big carrot grows out of the ground. The sea bunny's buckteeth grow longer and sniffs it. The giant carrot, who is actually Squidward in disguise, pops out of the soil and runs away. The sea bunny begins to follow Squidward.],
,Squidward:, Ha, he's gonna fall right into my trap. ,[laughs],
,[Squidward trips over a rock and gets caught in his own trap. The sea bunny begins knowing on Squidward's carrot costume.],
,Squidward:, ,[on the phone], Hello, Animal Control? I've got a sea bunny cornered in my garden and need assistance!
,[The animal control officer pulls over with Patrick locked in the back. He exits the truck, grabs the sea bunny and puts him in a cage.],
,Squidward:, Did you have to catch him that easily?
,SpongeBob:, ,[handcuffs himself on the sea bunny's cage], I demand the release of this poor woodland creature. He's got rights too, you know.
,Squidward:, This is none of your business, SpongeBob, go away!
,Animal Control Officer:, You want him? You can keep him. ,[gives SpongeBob the cage], Save me a trip to the incinerator.
,SpongeBob:, Hooray! ,[giggles],
,[SpongeBob pops out two rainbows and clouds from his head. The clouds fly under SpongeBob and form the word, ""Happy!"". SpongeBob floats away from Squidward's garden and flies into his house.],
,Squidward:, I'm warning you, SpongeBob. Keep that filthy animal away from my—,[gets slammed in the face when SpongeBob kicks the front door closed],
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens the fridge and talks in sing-song], Vegetables! That's what you like, isn't it, bunny? We'll see what we got in the fridge.
,[The sea bunny climbs out of the cage, sniff, and pants.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoops, I'm out of veggies. But I got something even better. ,[holds up Gary's food bowl], Gary's food! Yay! ,[the sea bunny sees how disgusting Gary's food is: a female shriek is heard off screen in horror of the food], Does bunny wunny like his dinny winny?
,[The sea bunny throws the food bowl in SpongeBob's face. The bowl falls off and SpongeBob wipes the food off.],
,SpongeBob:, All right, Gary's food is out. Got it. I'll get you veggies. I'll be right back.
,[SpongeBob forms himself into a egg-shaped rocket and blasts off out of his house. He flies over to the Barg'N-Mart to get vegetables. The sea bunny's stomach growls and begins looking around for food. He bites on the table and spits it out, breaking a flower pot in the process. He rips a hole on SpongeBob's chair and hops around, knocking over the shellphone. He opens the television screen, grabs some wires, and bites on them, electrocuting himself by accident. SpongeBob returns from the Barg'N-Mart with a bag of vegetables.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sing-song], Bunny wunny! I've got a surprise for you—,[screams when he sees the mess the sea bunny made],
,[SpongeBob's teeth scream as well. The living room is a complete mess and the wires from the walls are sparking. The sea bunny goes into the bag and begins eating the vegetables.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm gonna have to chew-proof this whole house fast! ,[pulls out a bottle of hot sauce], Hot sauce ought to do the trick.
,[SpongeBob squirts hot sauce on the couch and the shattered flower pot. The sea bunny sniffs the hot sauce and licks some. He belches out fire from his mouth and burns the flower pot. He giggles at this and hops for a bit. He goes to lick the hot sauce from the deflated chair. He belches fire at SpongeBob's  employee of the month photo and it burns. He goes to lick the hot sauce of SpongeBob's ribbons, trophy, books, and piggy bank as well as Gary's baby picture and toy ball. He belches fire on SpongeBob's stuff and burns everything. SpongeBob squirts hot sauce on Gary's shell and sees his living room on fire.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? No, no, no, no!
,[Thinking fast, SpongeBob takes a fire extinguisher and plugs it in his head. He absorbs the liquid from the extinguisher and spews it out all over the place to put out the fire. The sea bunny grabs the hot sauce bottle and drinks what's left of it. Suddenly, something bubbles in him and Gary backs away in panic. The sea bunny's face turns red and belches out a huge stream of fire.],
,SpongeBob:, My comic books!
,[SpongeBob sprays water with the water gun to protect his Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book collection from the fire. The sea bunny's mouth gets filled with water and he is cooled down.],
,SpongeBob:, I gotta get rid of all that hot sauce.
,[SpongeBob licks up all of the hot sauce until everything is clean.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns red hot and screams as his tongue erupts like a volcano], Oh, oh, oh, oh! ,[dunks in the toilet and cools himself off],
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting up a cage for the sea bunny to live in.],
,SpongeBob:, Here we are! Water supply—check. Trampoline for hopping—check. Buckteeth sharpener—check. And an adding machine for multiplying. ,[giggles], Triple check-aroonie! Now the bunny will be more than happy to stay in his cage. Huh? ,[pushes the cage to the sea bunny],
,[The sea bunny sniffs the cage. He is not happy at the cage and shrieks. He kicks the cage at SpongeBob and pants wildly.],
,SpongeBob:, Doesn't like cage... ,[falls into pieces], Check.
,[The sea bunny pants and growls. He climbs on the wall, rips a hole and crawls underneath the wallpaper.],
,SpongeBob:, No, no, bunny, don't go in there! You'll get lost! I need my jellyfishing net. Where did I put that thing? ,[runs to the sofa and digs his hand in the cushion], Probably dropped it in here somewhere. Nyah, nyah—ah, got it! ,[pulls out Patrick with the jellyfishing net on his head],
,Patrick:, Hello!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, did you fall between the cushions again?
,Patrick:, No, SpongeBob, I fell between the cushions. ,[takes of the net], But I have a solution to your bunny problem. I love the hunt!
,[Patrick rips a hole on the wall and crawls underneath the wallpaper to go after the sea bunny. But no matter where he goes, he knocks down everything off the wall.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams in panic as things drop off the wall], No, no! No, don't! Please don't! That's my—,[part of the ceiling as well as the ceiling fan falls down], All right, Patrick, that's enough hunting. You can come out now.
,Patrick:, I can't see where I'm going. How do I get out of here? ,[screams in panic as he crawls to another wall], SpongeBob, where are I? ,[gets absorbed by the wallpaper],
,SpongeBob:, Stay where you are, Patrick! I've got an idea. To the pet shop!
,[The screen changes into a map where SpongeBob, in video game character form, goes to the pet store to buys something.],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you! ,[goes back to his house with another sea bunny in a cage], Patrick! I bought a second bunny to lure the first bunny out of hiding.
,Patrick:, Hooray!
,[SpongeBob gets up, opens the cage, and lets out a female sea bunny with a pink bow on it. The sea bunny notices the female, crawls to the ground and pops out from the floor. He investigates her and see becomes heads over heels with him. They two sea bunnies dance to a tango and SpongeBob plays music with the accordion. Patrick reappears from the wall.],
,SpongeBob:, Hold still, Patrick, I see you. ,[rips a hole to free Patrick],
,Patrick:, ,[gasps for air and sighs], Thanks, buddy. ,[the two sea bunnies hop by], Aww, bunnies!
,[SpongeBob laughs as he follows the sea bunnies. Patrick comes out from the wall and follows as well. The two sea bunnies go into the bathroom and hop into the laundry basket. When SpongeBob and Patrick enter the bathroom, the two sea bunnies hop out of the basket.],
,SpongeBob:, One, two...,[another sea bunny comes out], Three?
,[It turns out the two sea bunnies multiplied in the laundry basket and a whole bunch of sea bunnies hop out.],
,Patrick:, More bunnies!
,SpongeBob:, ,[nervous laugh], Yay!
,[The sea bunnies climb into the hole on the wall and crawl under the wallpaper.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh-oh. ,[he and Patrick grab jellyfishing nets], Patrick, the hunt is on! ,[he and Patrick do their war cry],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick climb into the hole on the wall and crawl under the wallpaper as well. They chase after the sea bunnies from the bathroom, to the living downstairs, and then out the front door.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! Come back, bunny wunnies!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick chase after the sea bunnies all the way to Squidward's house. Squidward appears in a funeral attire and pays his final respects to his vegetable garden.],
,Squidward:, ,[French accent], This is the last carrot. ,[places the carrot next to the gravestone], C'est la vie. ,[the sea bunny pops out from the ground], One more step, and I will spit you on a roast! I mean, roast you on a spit! ,[the ground underneath rumbles and more sea bunnies appear], Oh, oh, what's happening?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick appear from the ground.],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward.
,Patrick:, Yeah. We're here to help!
,Squidward:, They're growing! ,[shrieks and runs into his house],
,[the sea bunnies crawl into Squidward's house. Squidward zips the door shut as sea bunnies crawl under the wallpaper. Squidward hides under the table and dials the shellphone.],
,Squidward:, Hello, Animal Control? Save me!
,[The sea bunnies emerge from the wallpaper and from one of Squidward's paintings. More sea bunnies emerge from the cabinets while others emerge from the electric outlet. Squidward blubbers in panic as sea bunnies invade his house. One sea bunny emerges from his nose. His entire house is flooded with sea bunnies. Squidward escapes from the upper window of his house. He gets up and groans like an old man. He shakes the sea bunnies off him and growls in anger. He grabs a mallet from the shed and spits on his hand.],
,Squidward:, Get out of my house! Gah! ,[hits his house with the mallet], That'll get them out.
,[Squidward's house cracks and breaks into two halves. The sea bunnies form into his own house from underneath the wallpaper, much to Squidward's horror.],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry about your house, Squidward.
,Patrick:, Yeah. We just heard.
,[Squidward is overwhelmed with what he did and whacked himself on the head with the mallet. His head opens and his brain flies out. Squidward goes mentally insane and grows bunny ears, whiskers, a pair of buckteeth, and a fluffy tail. He then begins to hop like a sea bunny.],
,Squidward:, ,[maniacal laugh], I'm a bunny now! ,[crazy laugh], I'm a bunny now! I'm a bunny now!
,Animal Control Officer:, Okay, Mr. Tentacles, easy does it. ,[puts a straitjacket on Squidward],
,[Squidward kicks the animal control officer in the face and runs away. The animal control officer gets up and goes after the mentally-crazed Squidward with the net.],
,Squidward:, ,[maniacal laugh], I'm a bunny now! ,[crazy laugh], I'm a bunny now!
,[As the animal control officer chase after the crazy squid into the sunset, one sea bunny makes a face to look like Squidward. He mumbles like Squidward and plays ""Shave and a Haircut"" on the clarinet before closing the sea bunny window, ending the episode.],

,[They pass a skeleton pointing left and it falls apart],
,SpongeBob:, It's not working!
,Mrs. Puff:, Here we are!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, where are we?
,Mrs. Puff:, This old abandoned road is the perfect venue for your driving test.
,SpongeBob:, Dr-iving test?!
,Mrs. Puff:, That's right! You're free from all the distracting obstacles on the boating course. ,[she stops the boat], Out here, there's nothing but the road. ,[gets out of the boat], Now, scooch over. ,[SpongeBob doesn't], Come on. Scooch over. ,[lifts up the seat and wiggles it until SpongeBob is behind the wheel],
,SpongeBob:, ,[buckling his seatbelt], But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?
,Mrs. Puff:, Forget all about that. Out here, you can teach a hermit crab to boat.
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!
,Mrs. Puff:, Listen. If you're nervous about boating, simply repeat the words: ""Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road."" Got it?
,SpongeBob:, O-o-okay. ,[takes the wheel], Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. ,[gulp], Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. ,[presses gas pedal, covers eyes], Focus on the road. ,[uncovers eyes], There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff.
,Mrs. Puff:, Wonderful! Keep that up and I'll have no choice but to pass you! Just repeat your mantra.
,SpongeBob:, Focus on the road, the open unintimidating road.
,[as he says this, they ride on a curved road],
,Mrs. Puff:, Boating within the lines. ,[checks said rule off her list], Well done.
,SpongeBob:, Focus on the road. ,[activates turn signal, boat turns left], There is nothing but the road.
,Mrs. Puff:, Finally using your turn signal, woohoo! ,[checks off ""uses turn signals], Check.
,SpongeBob:, Focus on the road. ,[drives the boat on a circular road], There is nothing ,but, the road.
,Mrs. Puff:, Roundabout navigation, check!
,SpongeBob:, Focus on the road, there is nothing ,but, the road! ,[presses gas pedal slightly harder, speeding the boat up],
,Mrs. Puff:, Safe and steady acceleration, check! ,[checks off said rule],
,SpongeBob:, Focus on the road... ,[drives the boat up a mountain], There is nothing but the road. ,[drives the boat through snow on top of the mountain and drives down it back to the road],
,[Mrs. Puff checks off ""Vertical driving"". SpongeBob continues repeating the mantra several times. He drives the boat over loopy roads and even under the road as well. He also makes the boat jump a gap, and even ducks under a garbage truck. A psychedelic moment of his driving begins: First, he drives on what looks like a mobius strip. Then he drives over a road with another SpongeBob under it. Then, he drives up a curvy road with a SpongeBob like face, which swallows the boat. The camera pans upward to a Saturn-like planet, and SpongeBob jumps out of the planet and drives along its ringlike road. The rings break and SpongeBob flies into the screen, acting like he's in a trance. The same goes with the boat driving into the screen, SpongeBob's head is at the bow. The boat drives around the inside of another SpongeBob, while at a real-life road. Finally, a skull rises, SpongeBob's mouth is in its eye sockets. Its road-tongue rolls out, and SpongeBob skates out, wearing boats as rollerskates. He jumps off, spins, and falls. Cut back to Mrs. Puff in reality],
,Mrs. Puff:, Check...check...and...CHECK! ,[pants], What is this?! ,[pants],
,[camera zooms to the only rule not checked off on Mrs. Puff's list: ""Safely dock vessel""],
,Mrs. Puff:, Only one more test, and it's the easiest one yet. SpongeBob, all you have to do is safely dock this vessel.
,[camera widens to show SpongeBob, still repeating the mantra. He is sweating and drooling, and his eyes are hypno-like],
,SpongeBob:, Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. ,[crashes through a ""road closed"" sign], Focus... ,[snaps out], on the...road? What happened to the road!?
,Mrs. Puff:, Calm down, SpongeBob. Listen: all you have to do is safely stop this vessel!
,SpongeBob:, Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!
,Mrs. Puff:, Just stop the boat!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh... ,[gasp], The road!
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, wait!
,[SpongeBob sends the boat airborne; the boat lands on a plain of rocks],
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBoooob!
,[The boat hits a large rock; the boat lands on a road.],
,SpongeBob:, That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it.
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob? This isn't just any road. ,[a truck honks two times], It's a 10-lane Intertial Seaway! ,[the truck honks again for 2 seconds],
,SpongeBob:, Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?!
,Mrs. Puff:, Stay calm, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob splats to the floor], SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! SpongeBob! Remember your mantra? 
,SpongeBob:, Right. ""Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road"" ,[SpongeBob gasps and the truck honks again], I can't even see the road! ,[SpongeBob shivers],. 
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob! Give me the wheel, SpongeBob. Oh, dear! He's completely frozen up! ,[Mrs. Puff rips off SpongeBob's hands and drives for him], Fiddlesticks!
,[The truck honks longer and the boat passes by a police station],
,Police Officer:, Reckless drivers. I loathe reckless drivers. ,[the officer presses a button on the side of his helmet, making sunglasses (goggles) appear over his eyes, as well as a mustache between his nose and mouth, and then drives his motorcycle],
,Police Officer:, Pull over, you menace! ,[SpongeBob screams, Mrs. Puff is still driving with SpongeBob's arms],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Mrs. Puff, can I have my arms back?
,Police Officer:, I said, stop your vessel!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. Officer sir, I'm applying the brakes! ,[SpongeBob drives away],
,Police Officer:, Uh, we got us a runner.
,Mrs. Puff:, Pull over, SpongeBob... And make it quick. Look! ,[SpongeBob screams], No!
,[Mrs. Puff screams in the tunnel],
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, hit the brakes!
,SpongeBob:, Huh? Oh! Okay! ,[Car screams to a stop in a parking spot],
,Mrs. Puff:, Goodness gracious. There isn't a scratch on this vessel. SpongeBob? The test is history! You, you passed! Here's your license! ,[SpongeBob smiles and sheds a tear], And I'm free! Ha ha! ,[officer arrives],
,Officer:, I don't think so.
,Mrs. Puff:, Is there a problem, officer? ,[looks at her fin],
,Officer:, Well, you crossed the county line three miles back. You, ma'am, ,[puts handcuffs on Mrs. Puff], are a parole violator, which makes this test...null and void. I'll take that. ,[Officer rips up SpongeBob's license, Mrs. Puff gets thrown into police car],
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, I'll get you for this! I'll get you!

"[Mr. Krabs kicks a mom and her son out of the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, And good riddance! Next time, you should read our sign about the mandatory side of fries policy! ,[Mr. Krabs takes a customer to the front register], Lookie, another flat-eyed, bushy-tailed customer!
,Gus:, But, I don't want to—
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[puts his ""finger"" into Fish #1's mouth], —stop spending money here? Well, don't worry, I'm certainly not going to keep you from doing what you want. Give him a Krabby Patty with the works!
,Gus:, I'm not hungry. ,[Krabs laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that's funny. ,[He handcuffs the fish to the ordering boat],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll think about that one while you buy a kelp soda. ,[Mr. Krabs goes into the kitchen, where SpongeBob is flipping patties as usual], Boy, you're doing it all wrong! Here, take this. ,[Mr. Krabs hands SpongeBob another spatula], Now you can flip 2 patties at the same time; do twice the work! ,[SpongeBob gasps and excitedly does so],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you're a—
,Mr. Krabs:, —genius? Perhaps. Or maybe I'm just a little off.
,[Mr. Krabs walks away],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, if only I was a little off.
,[Mr. Krabs walks by the fish and into his office],
,Gus:, Are you gonna let me out of here?
,[In his office, Mr. Krabs trips on a loose floorboard. He uncovers it to reveal the message-in-a-bottle Krabby Patty Secret Formula],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me formula! Darn these flimsy nails! How am I supposed to hide me formula with this nonsense? Ah, well. It's the life I choose to live.
,[He nails the floorboard back down, and Plankton watches from his enormous telescope that goes out the Chum Bucket and into the Krusty Krab through the chimney],
,Plankton:, Did you see that?
,Karen:, Yeah, Krabs hides his formula under the floor, so what?
,Plankton:, So, everything, that means I know where it is!
,Karen:, Doesn't mean you can get to it.
,Plankton:, Ugh, what kind of wife...? We'll just see about that.
,[Cut to Plankton using a giant mining drill powered by him on a stationary bicycle. Karen is on a screen on the inside],
,Plankton:, I knew this baby would come in handy.
,Karen:, Uh-huh.
,Plankton:, Turn on the navigation system, honey! Let's get this show on the road!
,Karen:, Dig 50 meters, then turn right.
,[He does so, digging straight down and then turning at a 90-degree angle],
,Plankton:, Heh, heh, heh, at this rate, we'll have the formula before you can say...
,[The machine is stopped by a giant boulder],
,Plankton:, Barnacles! Now what?
,Karen:, It appears that we've stumbled into a mishap. Now, we're stuck between a rock and a hard place... literally.
,Plankton:, Well, let's just dig deeper and go around it!
,Karen:, Uh, the only problem with that is...
,Plankton:, Shh! Can't you see I'm concentrating? ,[He starts to go under and around the rock], Yes! You see what happens when you let me make my own decisions? Now, maybe we'll get somewh- ,[Scream], ,[The drill goes through the roof of a subterranean cavern and they fall into a completely-enclosed underground cave. The miner lands in an underground river and Plankton comes out the exhaust pipe], What happened? ,[Karen appears on her mobile base],
,Karen:, Well, right before you started ""making your own decisions"", I was about to say we were digging right above an underground cave! ,[She shows a diagram on her monitor— The cave is like an underground rock bowl, with no exits except the tunnel the drill made through the top of the ""roof"". Plankton looks around at the river flowing through it, the dark bluish-gray stalactites dripping with water. A waterfall runs out the upper side of a cave rock ""wall""],
,Plankton:, The majesty! I've never seen such beauty. ,[He starts to cry, and Karen has spark plug-shaped ""tears"" coming down on her screen],
,Karen:, Sob, sob, cry, sob...
,Plankton:, It's just a shame no one else can see it!
,Karen:, Sob. ,[A light bulb appears on her monitor], Plankton! I think I know how to push Krabs out of business—we'll lure customers underground with this gorgeous scenery.

,Karen:, Ugh...
,Plankton:, Man, I'm good! ,[Growling comes from another cave attached to this one], Cave dwellers! ,[Big, hairy orange creatures with brown hair, sharp tusks and green lips come out of a cave. Plankton pulls out a whip and whips them into submission. They all sadly huddle in a corner], Back! That's better. From now on, you shall be my minions— servants to follow my every order! I decree this kingdom to be called the Chum Caverns! And may the people of Bikini Bottom shudder in awe of its Majesty! Ha, ha, ha, ha! ,[Later, Susie drags Abigail-Marge by the hand to the Chum Bucket],
,Susie:, Hurry up, Mom! I wanna see the Chum Caverns before the line gets too long!
,Abigail-Marge:, Never you mind, Susie, it's already too late for that!
,[A long line forms in front of a bucket-shaped elevator operated by a high-tech pulley system in front of the Chum Bucket. The pulley is attached to the index finger of the purple glove that holds the top of the Chum Bucket, and is pointing down towards Chum Caverns. The elevator opens, people crowd in, it closes again, and it lowers them down to Chum Caverns. In Chum Caverns, there are tables like the ones at the Chum Bucket all around an eating area, divided off by the river, and a great view of the waterfall. A menu and intestine-shaped tube comes from the ceiling and hovers above the ordering counter, placed between the eating area and the river. One of the cave creatures squirts chum onto a tray for Harold ,[shark], from the big tube and snarls],
,Cave Dweller #1:, ,[Scream],
,Harold:, You know, this stuff is hideously inedible, but the decor is so amazing, I can't resist spending my money here!
,Cave Dweller #1:, ,[Scream], ,[Harold walks away smiling, despite the spit and slobber from the cave creature cashier. SpongeBob is next in line],
,SpongeBob:, 2 orders of Chum Nuggets, please!
,Cave Dweller #1:, ,[Scream],
,SpongeBob:, That certainly is chum! And such steamy chumminess deserves recompense!
,Plankton:, Oh, I'll take that! ,[SpongeBob happily hands Plankton some money], Eat your blackened, twisted, money-grubbing heart out, Krabs! ,[He hops over to his register, stuffed and overflowing with money], I'm even profiting off of your most loyal ally! I'm running out of space for this stuff! Got an empty safe I can borrow, Krabs? ,[Plankton laughs coldly], But seriously, this is getting really heavy.
,[Falls under the weight of all his money. Patrick sits at a table with 2 Chum Sticks and slides the chum off the stick with his teeth when SpongeBob joins him],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, isn't this place amazing? ,[Patrick tries to respond with a mouthful, spitting food into SpongeBob's eyes. SpongeBob blinks and his eyes fling the food back into Patrick's mouth], Here are your Chum Nuggets, buddy. ,[SpongeBob pushes a polystyrene foam take-out container towards Patrick],
,Patrick:, Oh, I almost forgot! Here's your Chum Kebab! ,[Patrick hands him a drool covered Popsicle stick],
,SpongeBob:, Um, I guess you don't come down here for the food, anyways. You come down for the subterranean splendor of the Chum Caverns!
,Patrick:, ,[spits more food into SpongeBob's eyes while trying to speak], That, and the gift shop.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's right, Patrick! The gift shop! ,[They run into the Chum Caverns Gift Shop with windows and glass doors carved out of the rock wall, laughing. Inside, as shown through the windows, are stalagmites, gems, shells and other cave rocks, as well as other trinkets typical to a regular gift shop. Later, SpongeBob walks into an empty and abandoned Krusty Krab with a rubber stalagmite hat merged with a mining helmet on],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, baby! I've got cavern fever!
,Mr. Krabs:, Where have you been, and what is that ridiculous thing on your head?
,SpongeBob:, It's a ""stalagmiter,"" available exclusively at the Chum Caverns Gift Shop.
,Mr. Krabs:, How dare you spend all the money I don't pay you at me arch-rival's business! Boy, Plankton's really cleaning up down there, which means it's time to start running into the ground.
,[Cut to Plankton, serving up an order in Chum Caverns],
,Plankton:, Another order of Chumballs! ,[The entire cave shakes and rumbles, and cracks form in one of the walls], Huh?
,[Mr. Krabs bursts through with a jackhammer],
,Plankton:, Krabs? What are you doing here?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm here to steal back me customers, with the savory flavor of the Krabby Patty! ,[He moves a patty back and forth before their eyes, and they drool and their heads follow it like a dog], Now, go get it! ,[Motions to SpongeBob, who is manning a burger stand vendor labelled ""The Krusty Krab"". All of the customers rush over],
,Plankton:, Krabs, you can't just slither down here and steal all my customers! It's unethical!
,Mr. Krabs:, Unethical? This is perfectly legit! I call all building rights under my restaurant!
,Plankton:, Sea turtles! He called it! He always was good with legal jargon. ,[Plankton jumps onto his drill from earlier], Alright, Krabs, if you think it's fair to undercut my business, then I'm gonna undercut you! ,[Plankton digs underneath Mr. Krabs, which causes the ground Mr. Krabs is standing on to crumble, and him to fall a story down],
,Plankton:, Heh, heh, heh! How does it feel, Krabs? Being in the hole, so to speak. Not well, I'd imagine. Now hold still so I can bury you.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not if I bury you first! ,[He tunnels under Plankton with his jackhammer, so the chunk of rock Plankton's on falls, too. The customers and SpongeBob watch, all wearing the stalagmite hats],
,Plankton:, Fine, Krabs, have it your way! ,[Each constantly tunnel under each other, a spoof the the arcade game, ""Dig Dug"", until they fall into a very deep tunnel, and rocks seal it up. Mr. Krabs' gasps echo throughout the crevice],
,Mr. Krabs:, We're trapped! Trapped, I tell you!
,Plankton:, This is all your fault! I oughta boil and butter you for this!
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton, I don't think you grasp the severity of our situation. We're trapped down here. As in, there is no way out!
,Plankton:, Ha! There may be no way out for you, Krabs, but you needn't worry about me! My diminutive stature allows me to slip through rubble with ease. ,[He tries to slip between some gravel, but cannot because they are too heavy],
,Plankton:, I can't make it. We're doomed!

,Plankton:, No more skulduggery of any kind. ,[They shake on it, and hear a rumbling sound from above],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hang on a minute, don't you hear that? ,[SpongeBob breaks through the top with a jackhammer],

,Plankton:, Aha! Now time to get that formula! ,[The land beneath the Krusty Krab begins to crumble, and we see a view of all the tunnels made in the episode has left no support for the building, so it sinks into the earth and lands at the bottom of the tunnels. Now, SpongeBob, Plankton, Mr. Krabs and all the customers are stuck in the Krusty Krab, and the cave-in sealed the doors],
,Mr. Krabs:, Satisfied with yourself, Plankton? Now you've trapped us all underground!

,Karen:, How is that gonna help to boost sales?
,Plankton:, Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine.
,Karen:, Don't look now, but I think your catchy slogan days are numbered.
,Plankton:, ,[Turns around and looks at the customers],
,Nat:, ,[Barfs on floor], Uhh...something's not right.
,Pilar:, Yeah, I know, I keep sayin' ""Chum is Fum"" but it...ehh...it's just not workin'.

,Plankton:, ,NO,! That's not it you ,FOOL,! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like ""Chum is Fum""! But different.
,Patrick:, Oh... Gotcha. Hmmmmmm.
,Narrator:, 3 days later...
,[Cuts to outside of Chum Bucket with a longer line of customers. zooms in on new sign ""FUM IS CHUM""],
,Nat:, I'm so happy that they changed that old tired slogan, ""Chum is Fum"".

They'll buy anything I sell them. They're the dumbest of the dumb! ,[Frank and Nancy throw away chum], The stupidest of the stupid! ,[Debbie Rechid and Susie throw away Chum], They're dummies, dweebs and doodoo dunderheads! I can keep that rabble right where I want 'em! Huh?
,Hockey Player:, What was that part about doodoo dunderheads, eh?

"[pans over live-action houses],
,Narrator:, And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate. ,[The exterior of Patchy's house is shown. The name ""Patchy"" appears. Inside, Patchy is wrapping presents],
,Patchy:, , [to the tune of ""Jingle Bells""], Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho. ,[he notices he's on air], Oh! Hi. ,[he waves], I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club! ,[He notices a long piece of confetti on his hook and tries to shake it off. He pulls on it and whacks himself in the eye, giving him a black eye. He switches his patch over to the other eye], Hey, that's better! ,[Potty, a puppet bird on strings, flies in],
,Potty:, ,[squawks], Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
,Patchy:, That's right, Potty! It ,is, Christmas. ,[he limps over to the fireplace], And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year. ,[he blows on his pipe, and bubbles emerge], Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now! ,[He picks up a picture of SpongeBob. Cuts to SpongeBob, holding a remote],
,SpongeBob:, I sure am! ,[He presses a button on the remote. A large chimney rises from the ground next to his house, and a gigantic funnel pops out of it with the words ""Welcome Santa"" in neon letters], I'm ready! ,[Patchy laughs],
,Patchy:, Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae. ,[he puts down SpongeBob's picture], And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating. ,[He picks up a picture of Patrick. Cuts to Patrick standing by his house with a dopey smile on his face. Zooms out to reveal a single ornament hanging from the antenna on top of his rock. It snaps off and hits the ground, and Patrick does the same as well. Now, Patchy is mixing cookie dough], I too am also preparing for Christmas. ,[he lifts up the mixer], Hmm, unbaked cookie dough! ,[he takes a lick], Mmm...
,Potty:, ,[squawks], Potty want cookie dough! ,[he flies over, squawking], Cookie! ,[Patchy ducks],
,Patchy:, Potty! No! ,[Potty flies back and forth],
,Potty:, Cookie! ,[squawks],
,Patchy:, Get out of here!
,Potty:, Cookie!
,Patchy:, Potty!
,Potty:, ,[squawks], Give us a lick!
,Patchy:, Back off, you flying freak! ,[Potty flies on the counter],
,Potty:, ,[squawks], Clarify please.
,Patchy:, ,[the cookies are shaped like SpongeBob and Patrick], This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots. ,[Cuts to Hans reaching over and ringing a bell. Patchy looks out the window], What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means!
,Children:, ,[off-screen], Free ice cream! ,[Patchy laughs],
,Patchy:, No, you silly livers. ,[sternly], No!
,Potty:, ,[squawks], Man overboard? ,[Patchy walks over to a desk],
,Patchy:, You, I'm ignoring. ,[he sits down], No, it means it's time to open fan letters! ,[Potty flies over with a letter in his beak],
,Potty:, ,[squawks], Here you go! ,[Patchy tugs at it],
,Patchy:, Thank you, Potty. ,[Potty is not letting go], Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you! ,[Potty squawks, still not letting go], Come on, give it, you birdbrain! ,[Potty squawks some more], Quiet, infernal bird! ,[He uses his hook, now with a pair of scissors on the end, to snip Potty's rope. Potty squawks and falls to the ground. Patchy nods], Hmm. ,[he sits back down], This letter comes to us from...
,Fish Head:, ,[as voiceover], Name and address withheld! ,[Patchy tears the envelope open, pieces of it flying all over. He pulls up his eye patch and replaces it with a pair of reading glasses with one eye covered up],
,Patchy:, And he writes, ""Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours...""
,Fish Head:, ,[as voiceover], Name and address withheld! ,[Patchy gets up and takes off his glasses. Now his eye patch is back on],
,Patchy:, A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom.
,Potty:, ,[squawks], They didn't?
,Patchy:, No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain. ,[He pulls down Potty's strings. Potty, as well as his puppeteer, falls to the ground. Patchy hangs a homemade SpongeBob ornament on a Christmas tree. Zooms out, showing the entire tree, which is decorated with many similar SpongeBob, as well as ornaments featuring Patrick and Squidward, and a few gift boxes], There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom. ,[he snaps his fingers], Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas? ,[Cuts to Potty, who looks very drowsy and with bloodshot eyes. Patchy turns around], Potty? ,[he sees an empty bowl of cookie dough, accompanied by a foghorn noise], You ate all me cookie dough! ,[Potty is now incredibly fat. The whole lower half of his body, along with his strings, fall off, leaving only his head],
,Potty:, Squ-ouch! ,[Patchy shrugs],
,Patchy:, Oh, well. On with the show.
,[After the Title Card and Opening Credits, SpongeBob is shown waiting on a hill near Sandy's treedome, wearing karate gloves],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. ,[practices karate and sneaks over to Sandy's door as Sandy hums ""Jingle Bells""],
,SpongeBob:, What diabolical act is she committing now? ,[Sandy plugs in Christmas lights outside her tree and SpongeBob freaks out], Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire! ,[rushes inside and instead of throwing water on tree, he throws it on Sandy], Huh? So I guess there's no fire?
,Sandy:, What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?
,SpongeBob:, Christmas who?
,Sandy:, What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?
,SpongeBob:, Is she a friend from Texas?
,Sandy:, ,[laughs], No. I can't believe you haven't heard of... ,[makes an adorable face], ...Christmas.
,SpongeBob:, Tell me more about this... ,[imitates Sandy], ...""Christmas.""
,Patchy:, And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus. ,[SpongeBob's eyes widen],
,[The next day at The Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, ,[standing on a table towards Squidward, Patrick and Mr. Krabs], And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.
,Squidward:, Yawn.
,SpongeBob:, But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.
,Patrick:, Just like a genie. ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.
,SpongeBob:, That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs. ,[grabs a piece of paper and pencil], Here you go! You can get started on your letter.
,Squidward:, I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.
,Patrick:, Like a genie.
,Mr. Krabs:, Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.
,Squidward:, Oh, brother.
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, who's next?
,Patrick:, Ooh, ooh, me, me!
,Squidward:, Ooh.
,SpongeBob:, Here you go, Patrick.
,Patrick:, There's no words on this paper.
,SpongeBob:, Not yet.
,Patrick:, ,[grabs a pencil], Yippee! A writing stick.
,SpongeBob:, C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter. ,[Patrick's letter tears in half],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?
,SpongeBob:, Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid... ,[Patrick rips his again], ...ward.
,Patrick:, Uhh, SpongeBob... ,[hands him another piece], Thanks. ,[sits down and starts writing with the paper on top of the pencil], Dear Sant... ,[paper rips], D'oh! Not again.
,SpongeBob:, Here, Patrick, watch me. ,[starts to write], Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish. ,[puts the letter in a bottle], Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!
,[presses it and the bottle shoots up to the surface],
,Patrick:, Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?
,SpongeBob:, Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.
,SpongeBob:, Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?
,Mr. Krabs:, A pony.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Mr. Krabs:, With saddle bags full of money! ,[shoots a bottle up to the surface],
,Patrick:, Here you go, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, What did you wish for, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Another piece of paper. ,[bottle shoots up to the surface],
,SpongeBob:, And what did you wish for, little girl?
,Susie:, Front teeth!
,Cowboy:, I could use a new hat!
,Jennifer-Millie:, I need a new hairstyle!
,Lonnie:, I like a glass of water for my teeth.
,[lots of bottles get shot up to the surface],
,Squidward:, Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.
,SpongeBob:, Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?
,Squidward:, My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.
,Everyone:, Hooray!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ♪It's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday. Not your normal, average, everyday.♪

,Martin:, I hope he can read Portuguese.
,SpongeBob:, Ahh, well that's the last letter. Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet! ,[runs to Squidward with a pencil, bottles, and paper in hand], Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry! ,[runs into Squidward's house and upstairs to have him write his letter],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started. ,[writes letter for Squidward], Dear Santa Claus...
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, forget it.
,SpongeBob:, Right, too formal. Hi Santa...
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, no.
,SpongeBob:, Howdy, Claus?
,Squidward:, ,[pushes SpongeBob out of his door], I'm not writing a letter to a figment of your imagination.
,SpongeBob:, But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus!
,SpongeBob:, C’mon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose?
,Squidward:, My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch. ,[closes door],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, c'mon. ,[everyone tries to get Squidward outside],
,Citizens:, C’mon, Squidward! Don't be a party pooper! C'mon out!

,Fred:, Thanks for the lies, Mr. Fairytale! Let's go waste our time somewhere else.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, guys, where's your Christmas Spirit? He's just running late.
,Patrick:, He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! ,[they wait and wait and then one of the jellyfish jars breaks on SpongeBob's head as the jellyfish floats away],
,Patrick:, Never trust a genie. ,[Patrick and a snowman walk away],
,Squidward:, ,[alarm goes off], Ahh, morning already? Oh, boy! ,[speaking in a megaphone], Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? ,[SpongeBob does so], Say Santa Claus.

,Squidward:, Aww, our first Christmas. This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas. ,[donkey appears on screen making noises as he laughs], Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me. ,[laughing at SpongeBob more],
,SpongeBob:, You were right, Squidward. This was a stupid holiday. ,[cries; takes out a present], I still want you to have this.
,Squidward:, What? What's this?
,SpongeBob:, A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! ""[cries some more]""
,Squidward:, Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...
,SpongeBob:, You're welcome. ,[sadly walks off and cries],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or... ,[imitates a hillbilly], his favorite underpants. Haha. Present.,[opens the present], Why, it looks like a clarinet. ,[smells it], It smells like one, too. Handcrafted out of driftwood. And it's even got my name on it. ,[finds a button that says ""push""], What's this? ,[pushes the button and 3 wooden Squidwards with clarinets come out and bob up and down], Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a... ,[donkey appears on screen and makes noises], big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob? , [SpongeBob is on a ladder trying to get his lights down],
,SpongeBob:, I guess I won't be needing this. ,[slides down with the lights in hand], That's better. ,[a gray cloud comes and rains on SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, The poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.
,SpongeBob:, I'd better get this stuff off of Squid's place.

,Squidward:, Don't do that again.
,SpongeBob:, I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly?
,Squidward:, Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.
,SpongeBob:, Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?
,Squidward:, Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.
,SpongeBob:, And what about that nose? ,[pokes his nose and laughs], I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that thing's gigantic. ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, Alright! I'm Santa.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps onto Squidward], Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.
,Squidward:, I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.
,SpongeBob:, I did? ,[faints and falls on Gary's shell],
,Gary:, Meow.
,Squidward:, Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.
,Shelly:, Do you have a present for me, Santa?
,Squidward:, Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.
,Squidward:, Uhh, right, just a second. ,[searches in his house for something], C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect! ,[hands the little girl a wrench], There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!
,Shelly:, Thanks, Santa. ,[scratches the wrench like it was a puppy],
,Squidward:, That almost felt good. ,[Squidward then notices a long line of citizens waiting for presents], I didn't... who?
,Fred:, Hey, Santa, where's my present?
,Old Man Jenkins:, And mine!
,Abigail-Marge:, And what about me?
,Squidward:, Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people. ,[searches for stuff in his house], Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.

,Little Girl:, Thanks, Santa. ,[She puts them on like front teeth],
,Squidward:, ,[gives Patrick a clock], Here you go, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Wow. ,[punches a hole through the clock], A wrist watch.
,Squidward:, , [gets everything else in his house to the citizens], What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane? ,[SpongeBob knocks on the door], You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind. ,[turns SpongeBob towards the door and pushes him so he walks], And Santa is... oh, his belly was small, but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...
,Squidward:, Well, at least it's over. ,[notices a bottle with a letter in it on the ground], Huh? What's this?
,Santa:, Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus. ,[letter disappears into thin air], Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! ,[in his sleigh flying], Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. ,[does a crazy dance while saying his ""ho ho ho""],
,Squidward:, ,[Shocked to see Santa does exist and non-chalantly],Yup, I'm insane. ,[plays his wooden clarinet in the ending tone of the episode],
,Santa:, Merry Christmas! ,[back at Patchy's house, a sailboat with a homemade Sponge and Pat moves in front of a picture of the island, which has a bunch of presents on it],
,Patchy:, Dee dee, dee dee dee dee.
,SpongeBob:, ,[as a puppet], Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!
,Patrick:, ,[also a puppet], Presents, ahoy.

,Patrick:, Yay! I mean yikes!
,Patchy:, ,[makes more sound effects and begins speaking in his own voice], Oh, we're going down! ,[He keeps making noises. Zoom out to show the boat is on Patchy's head], Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel! ,[he screams],
,Man on Set:, ,[off-screen], Patchy?
,Patchy:, Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure. ,[He takes the boat off his head. Potty flies out, and there is a nest was under him, and in it are a few eggs wrapped in bows. Patchy picks one up], Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present. ,[He laughs. Then he goes over to the mistletoe], Arr, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means. ,[he sprays breath freshener in his mouth], Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate! ,[he makes kissing noises], Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain! ,[He laughs. Potty flies over and squawks. Patchy screams],
,Potty:, Give us a kiss! ,[Patchy goes to avoid him],
,Patchy:, No! No, not you! ,[Potty keeps flying around squawking], No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this. Potty! No!
,Potty:, Kissy, kissy!
,Narrator:, Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays.

,Patrick:, What'll we do?
,SpongeBob:, They're looking for an invention, right?
,Patrick:, Right.
,SpongeBob:, So let's start inventing!
,Patrick:, Yeah! ,[cut to later, where SpongeBob and Patrick are carrying a table. Patrick falls over the table],
,SpongeBob:, It's time to get serious, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Right! ,[crashes], I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.
,SpongeBob:, That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented. ,[more crashing],
,Patrick:, Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark.
,SpongeBob:, Light bulb, already invented. ,[more grunting and crashing is heard],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe.
,SpongeBob:, That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented.
,Patrick:, Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!
,SpongeBob's Reflection:, ,[says in a strange accent], Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea.
,SpongeBob:, ,[his invention crashes], Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything. ,[acoustic guitar plays. It's Sandy],
,Sandy:, ♪So long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.♪
,SpongeBob:, ,[both cry], I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever! ,[later, SpongeBob and Patrick are experimenting and building an invention], We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here.
,Patrick:, Who?
,SpongeBob:, Sandy's bosses. ,[Patrick is clueless], The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!
,Patrick:, ,[Clueless],I have no idea what you're talking about. ,[they both exit the treedome to greet Sandy's bosses],
,Chimp #1:, Good day, gentlemen. Allow me to introduce ourselves. I am Professor Percy. This is Dr. Marmalade.
,Dr. Marmalade:, At your service.
,Professor Percy:, And this is Lord Reginald.
,Lord Reginald:, Charmed.
,Patrick:, You guys talk funny. Say more words!
,Professor Percy:, We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff.
,SpongeBob:, Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!
,Patrick:, And I used to be dumb. ,[goofy laughter],
,Professor Percy:, Quite. And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?
,SpongeBob:, My name is SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, And I am Professor Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, Professor?
,Patrick:, Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.
,Professor Percy:, Where is Miss Cheeks?
,SpongeBob:, She should be back any moment.
,Patrick:, ,[Finally recalling what SpongeBob said],I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!
,SpongeBob:, Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?
,Patrick:, Good idea.
,SpongeBob:, Well?
,Patrick:, Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work. ,[cut to later, where everyone is standing in front of an invention],
,SpongeBob:, Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you... ,[reveals the invention], The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!
,Professor Percy:, This is where our research money went?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!
,Lord Reginald:, An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner. Yes, well, I've heard that claim before.
,Professor Percy:, Yes, how do we know this contraption works?
,Dr. Marmalade:, Let's see a demonstration.
,Patrick:, Step right up. ,[points to Lord Reginald], You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.
,Lord Reginald:, Me? ,[Patrick straps him in the contraption], Are you sure this is safe?
,Patrick:, As sure as I'm a doctor professor.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, don't you think we should test it?
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[turns invention on. The contraption comes down over Lord Reginald],
,SpongeBob:, That's not exactly what I had in mind!
,Professor Percy:, Lord Reginald, are you all right? ,[inside the invention, Lord Reginald is getting his hair trimmed],
,Lord Reginald:, Oh, I say, this is splendid. ,[getting his back scratched], Oh, absolutely splendid. What's this? ,[nose is getting picked], Oh, marvelous. This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant.
,SpongeBob:, Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
,Patrick:, Thank you, lowly assistant.
,Lord Reginald:, Oh, I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!
,SpongeBob:, Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.
,Lord Reginald:, Now it's tuning my ukulele! ,[the ukulele makes a sour note and the invention goes out of control. Lord Reginald is hit on the head with the ukulele], Ouch! Ooh! I say, was that necessary? ,[he gets slapped on the back of his head], You, sir, are impertinent. ,[a pair of scissors, fire, a saw, and more gadgets surround him], Oh, dear. ,[screams],
,Dr. Marmalade:, Lord Reginald, are you all right? ,[shrieks and explosions are heard], I'm sorry, was that a yes?
,Professor Percy:, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?
,Patrick:, It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I really wish Sandy were here. ,[cut to Sandy, who is in front of a bus that has just pulled up],
,Bus Driver:, All aboard!
,Sandy:, Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?
,Bus Driver:, It sure does. We make stops in Quittersville, Failuretown, and Loserburg. ,[Sandy hears the screaming],
,Sandy:, What in tarnation?! ,[enters her treedome], What's with all the monkey business?! ,[gasps],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy!
,Sandy:, SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?! ,[the invention spits Lord Reginald out],
,Lord Reginald:, Ouch.
,Patrick:, It works! It works!
,Professor Percy:, Lord Reginald, are you all right?
,Lord Reginald:, I seem to have ruptured my pomposity.
,Professor Percy:, We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately.
,Dr. Marmalade:, Frankly, I'm beginning to question the economic benefits of underwater treedomes. Doesn't make much sense once you get right down to it.
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay.
,Sandy:, I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick.
,Patrick:, That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
,Sandy:, ,[annoyed at Patrick's stupidity], Don't push it.
,Patrick:, ,[Meekly], Sorry.
,Professor Percy:, We are departing, Dr. Marmalade.
,Dr. Marmalade:, My word, all of this excitement has drastically reduced my potassium levels. ,[he takes out a banana, and the nutcracker turns back on and peels it], Good gracious! Can it be?
,Professor Percy:, Try it again. ,[Lord Reginald gets a banana out and the nutcracker peels it],
,Lord Reginald:, Oh! It is! It is! It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for! ,[excited chattering from the chimps],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!
,Sandy:, Yeah. ,[cut to later when the chimps are about to leave],
,Professor Percy:, Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations.
,Lord Reginald:, It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise.
,Sandy:, I accept.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hooray!
,Professor Percy:, I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks. Great things.
,Lord Reginald:, Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.
,Dr. Marmalade:, Now, now, one miracle at a time.
,All Chimps:, Goodbye!
,Sandy:, Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption.
,Patrick:, My turn. ,[sits on his invention], Whoo-hoo! ,[machine turns on and he screams], All right!

"[The episode begins on another day at the Krusty Krab. A sweet old lady is knitting a scarf with her yarn while enjoying her meal. Mr. Krabs walks up to her.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And how was your meal today, ma'am?
,Sweet Old Lady:, Oh, delicious. I wish I could tell everyone how great my meal was.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience.
,Sweet Old Lady:, I don't really have time to do that. Perhaps I will mention it in my will.
,[The sweet old lady takes her knitting supplies and drives away on her mobility scooter. Mr. Krabs takes out his whip and prepares to hit her.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that's the way you want it.
,SpongeBob:, Wait! I have an idea!
,[SpongeBob runs into Mr. Krabs' office and brings out a cork board. He hangs it on the window.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.
,[The court board shows a memo with the words, ""Make More Money"" and a picture of money on the bottom.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely.
,[The sweet old lady knits a review about her visit and sticks it on the court board. Then she drives away on her mobility scooter. A customer walks up and reads the review.],
,Ivy (gray):, ""My Krusty Krab meal was delicious! I cannot recommend it enough!"" Huh. Well, I was just gonna loiter, but now I think I'll get a Krabby Patty.
,[The customer walks off. Mr. Krabs' eyes became dollar signs and money pops out of his mouth, realizing that it is a fantastic idea. Then he closes his mouth.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me...,[stammers], I mean the community.
,[The scene changes to customers lining up to put their reviews on the bulletin board. SpongeBob sheds a tear.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], Community!
,[SpongeBob and the customers look at the reviews. As time goes by, more court boards were added as more reviews keep stocking up. One puts a lost sign on it while another puts Old Man Jenkins on it. Customers continue to read the bulletin board of reviews while eating their meal. Squidward and SpongeBob continue serving the meals to the customers.],
,Pearl:, Oh, I really hope people like it! ,[laughs],
,[Pearl puts a picture of a unicorn dancing under the rainbow on the bulletin board. Random customers put pictures on the bulletin board as well.],
,Voice #1:, Great!
,Voice #2:, Super good!
,Voice #3:, Number 1 with a star!
,[Pearl laughs. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs gluing money on the walls of his office.],
,SpongeBob:, See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!
,SpongeBob:, Let's see what other nice people are saying.
,[SpongeBob leaves the office, but moments later, SpongeBob squeals very loud. His squeal causes the money to fall off the wall and makes Mr. Krabs fall into his sack.],
,Dave:, What are you shrieking about?
,[SpongeBob steps in front of the bulletin board.],
,SpongeBob:, Nothing! I just love to shriek!
,[Dave tries to look and see the bulletin board, but SpongeBob, while shrieking, prevents him from looking.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!
,[Mr. Krabs moves SpongeBob away from the bulletin board and Dave reads the blue paper.],
,Dave:, ""When I eat at the Krusty Krab, all I get is a dark, empty feeling inside!"" P-Star7. Ouch!
,[The customers murmur in wonder about the review. Mr. Krabs becomes nervous and goes to remove the review.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[growls], Not on my bulletin board!
,Surfer Fish:, Whoa, whoa, dude! What's with the censorship? The community bulletin board is for everybody. You can't just take somethin' down because you think it's bogus.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected.
,[SpongeBob pushes his nose and a pencil comes out of his head. Then he writes on a small pink paper.],
,SpongeBob:, Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted.
,[SpongeBob puts his note on the bulletin board and his pencil back in his head. But he sees another note.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ""Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted."" Signed, Guybesideu3?
,[SpongeBob sees Tyler whistling beside him. Then he sees more notes on the board.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[gasps], ""Dumb-blurted! LOL!""?, ""What's the Point""?, ""I could make a better patty out of mud""?! Where are all these notes coming from?
,[Mr. Krabs is going around selling paper and pencils to the customers so they can write notes for the bulletin board.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!
,Martin:, I want to express the worst side of myself!
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[points to menu], Hmm.
,SpongeBob:, If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.
,[Patrick walks in the restaurant.],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Hello!
,[Patrick notices everyone discussing about P-Star7's message on the bulletin board. He then walks through the crowd.],
,Nat Peterson:, P-Star7 is my new hero.
,Patrick:, Hey, that's me!
,Harold:, Yeah, right.
,Fred:, He really knows how to complain.
,Patrick:, But I wasn't com...
,[Patrick goes up to the board to put a note on it.], 
,Unnamed customer:, P-Star7 is cool because he's anonymous.
,Patrick:, ,[hides his note], Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse.
,Bubble Bass:, You may not like what P-Star7 has to say, but you have to agree that he keeps it ""real"". He's a true hero for our troubled times.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em.
,[SpongeBob goes into the kitchen and attempts to make better Krabby Patties. He examines them closely and takes out a compass to see how round it is.],
,SpongeBob:, No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here.
,[SpongeBob cuts part of the patty with the spatula and takes out a metric ruler to measure it.],
,SpongeBob:, No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here.
,[SpongeBob even up the patty with the spatula and takes out a tape measure to measure it.],
,SpongeBob:, Now it's smaller than that one!
,[SpongeBob takes out his spatula and tries to flatten the Krabby Patty. However, he ended up splattering it all over the place and made the Krabby Patties into a lump of meat.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Yes?
,SpongeBob:, Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?
,Squidward:, Oh, he responded hours ago.
,SpongeBob:, Well, why didn't you tell me?
,[SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen.],
,Squidward:, Because I don't care.
,[SpongeBob goes to the bulletin board a finds a note underneath his.],
,SpongeBob:, That's for me! ""Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139!"" Cordially, P-Star7.
,Bubble Bass:, His vituperative hyperbole has certainly diminished your credibility.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, why did you have to say that?
,Bubble Bass:, You're right. I should have put it on the bulletin board instead. ,[writes his note and puts it on the board], Signed, HandsomeLad42.
,SpongeBob:, You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!
,[SpongeBob runs away. The customers and Mr. Krabs cruelly laugh at SpongeBob's humiliation.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register.
,[Squidward is sleeping at his register.],
,Sheldon:, I brought a bag lunch.
,[The customers reveal to Mr. Krabs that they've brought bag lunches.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!
,Medley Fishbowl:, Why would we buy food from a place that quote ,[reads note on sock], ""Smells like stinky armpits""?
,Mr. Krabs:, What?
,[Mr. Krabs sniffs his armpit and crumbles to dust. Then he comes back up again.],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's not true!
,Medley Fishbowl:, Hey, it's on the board.
,Bubble Bass:, And the board is never wrong.
,Mr. Krabs:, And does anyone need to buy a pen?
,[Everyone holds up their pens.],
,Mr. Krabs:, How about some paper?
,[Everyone holds up their paper and Mr. Krabs facepalms himself in disgust. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick in tears.],
,Patrick:, What's wrong?
,SpongeBob:, It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.
,Patrick:, Oh, I think they were all good things.
,SpongeBob:, Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.
,Patrick:, Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more.
,SpongeBob:, No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.
,Patrick:, ,[gasp], You were Fry-Banshee?!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Patrick:, Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves...
,SpongeBob:, He said that?!
,Patrick:, Oh, not yet!
,[The scene changes to the outside of the Krusty Krab being covered by numerous reviews that are written by P-Star7.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!
,Mr. Krabs:, He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!
,[Patrick is sucking his hand in his mouth.],
,Patrick:, ,[muffled], No, I'm not.
,[Patrick puts salt on his hand and continues sucking his hand. SpongeBob is shown wearing a snowsuit, a hat, and earmuffs in the kitchen.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold.
,Mr. Krabs:, Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!
,SpongeBob:, You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!
,[Soon, everyone puts random notes on SpongeBob and Squidward seems to be enjoying it as he cruelly laughs at it.],
,Sandals:, ,[reads note], ""You smell!""
,[Laughter],
,Gus:, ,[reads note], ""One of your eyes is too big!""
,[Laughter],
,Bubble Bass:, ,[reads note while eating], ""Close your mouth when you eat!""? ,[spits out food],
,[Laughter],
,Pearl:, Oh! ,[reads note], ""This picture looks like it was drawn by a Brine Shrimp!"" Oh, Daddy! ,[cries],
,[Squidward cruelly laughs at this until he reads P-Star7's note about him.],
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[reads note], ""Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register."" P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yokels understand I'm working here? Ironically!
,Bubble Bass:, Oh, sure you are. P-Star7 has your number alright.
,Squidward:, I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!
,[Squidward and Bubble Bass fight each other until SpongeBob breaks them up.],
,SpongeBob:, People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!
,[All of the customers gasps in realization.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, that's it! Everybody out!
,[Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob puts up the closed sign on the window.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message.
,Mr. Krabs:, We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!
,SpongeBob:, A lesson in polite manners.
,Squidward:, Or we could push him off a cliff.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab late at night. SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are in the register boat as they are prepared to catch P-Star7.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[through walkie-talkie], This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?
,[SpongeBob looks around.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower.
,[Squidward takes the walkie talkie from SpongeBob.],
,Squidward:, ,[yells loudly], I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!
,[Squidward hides his flower tattoo that is on his left arm and gives the walkie-talkie back to SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs looks around.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.
,[A mysterious round figure opens the front door and rolls across the floors. The figure stops under a nearby table and licks up a ketchup stain with his tongue.],
,SpongeBob:, So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.
,[SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs hide in the register boat. The mysterious figure walks up to the bulletin board and sticks another note on it. Mr. Krabs turns on the light and the mysterious figure turns out to be none other than Patrick Star.],
,SpongeBob:, Surprise, P-Star7!
,SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward:, Patrick?!
,[Patrick smiles nervously.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams in anger], I'll tear ya to pieces!
,[Patrick cowers in fear as he thinks Mr. Krabs is going to hurt him. However, Mr. Krabs moves Patrick away and breaks his cork board into a million pieces. Then he removes all of the random notes off of the entire restaurant and tosses them all outside on the street.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you're P-Star7?
,Patrick:, Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way.
,SpongeBob:, So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth.
,[Patrick is chewing on his baseball glove.],
,Patrick:, Yeah, I think.
,SpongeBob:, You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along.
,[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs felt sorry about their actions and took pity on Patrick. However, Mr. Krabs resumes his anger.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh! ,[picks up paper], This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower.
,Squidward:, ,[takes coupon], Oh, ratfish!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs knitting with the sweet old lady at the Shady Shoals Rest Home.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn? ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, Oh, brother. ,[puts the yarn bag over his head], Please bring back P-Star7.

,Plankton:, Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well. at least it's structurally sound. ,[door falls on him], Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business.
,Karen:, Then why don't you fix this rust bucket up? Look around. Chipping paint, bad plumbing, dust bunnies-- ,[a literal dust bunny blows away], it's no wonder you don't have any customers.
,Plankton:, Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul. ,[cut to outside the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is dragging a blue paint bucket], Whoa! Whoa! ,[almost falls in the bucket. Grabs the paintbrush but has difficulty painting the building], I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor. ,[falls down with the wooden side of the paintbrush in his mouth. Then spits it out and coughs], Ah! This is a job for an imbecile! ,[Patrick and SpongeBob are laughing while playing leapfrog], Or two imbeciles. ,[laughs], Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I'm having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to paint The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble.
,SpongeBob:, Aw. well, we can help you. Right, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Uh-huh. I came prepared, too. ,[holds up a watermelon and sticks his head in it], Alright, let’s do it. ,[cut to later],
,Plankton:, Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Pizzazz, yeah.
,Plankton:, Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whoa, really?
,Plankton:, Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen now, would you?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, No, sir. Uh-uh.
,Plankton:, Well, hop to it, lads.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[salute], Yes, sir!
,Squidward:, ,[listening to music], Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. We like to work.
,Squidward:, What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?
,SpongeBob:, Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz. ,[sparkle dust lands on Squidward],
,Squidward:, Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about ,that,?
,Patrick:, Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.
,SpongeBob:, Let's show him ,[they paint each other vigorously],
,Squidward:, You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush? ,[takes a blue paintbrush], I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes. ,[paints a little on the Chum Bucket],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Oh. ,[they lightly paint each other],
,Squidward:, Yeah. Perfect. ,[keeps on painting], Simpletons.
,Plankton:, Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one. ,[chuckles], My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get-- ,[clears his throat], --a drink?
,Plankton:, Let me show you something, SpongeBob. ,[opens doors], I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut. ,[SpongeBob breaks the stiff liquid],
,SpongeBob:, I see what you mean.
,Plankton:, Yes. If only there was some way I could—Where'd he go?
,SpongeBob:, ,[lollygags outside], La-la-la-la-la-la-la. ,[Plankton laughs as SpongeBob goes into The Krusty Krab basement and takes out some pipes, which cause a leak],
,Plankton:, ,[walks up to The Krusty Krab doors], Secret formula, here I come. ,[opens the door and a bunch of water streams out. Plankton screams],
,SpongeBob:, La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
,Plankton:, Perfect. Huh? ,[Squidward is painting himself on The Chum Bucket. Plankton climbs up the ladder and jumps on Squidward's head], No! No! No! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush! ,[takes brush and paints something], Yes, yes, and yes. ,Voila!, ,[bluegrass music plays as he paints a log cabin],
,Squidward:, A log cabin?
,Plankton:, Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art. ,[jumps off of Squidward's head],
,Squidward:, Everyone's a critic.
,Plankton:, I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The secret Krabby Patty formula.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab.
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?
,SpongeBob:, I guess I hadn't thought about that.
,Patrick:, I did. ,[a round window is near the ground], Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind.
,Plankton:, See, SpongeBob? Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window. ,[notices the window is showing a blank wall],
,Patrick:, Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird. ,[Plankton unscrews a bolt from the window and puts it in between his teeth and grunts. Then breaks the bolt],
,Plankton:, Can't you two do anything right?! I give you one simple task after another and-- Just forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketing—life guarding—creative writing—all such bitter failures. ,[cries],
,SpongeBob:, ,[picks up Plankton], Oh. It's okay, little green—creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest restaurant in Bikini Bottom.
,Plankton:, ,[crying], Really?
,SpongeBob:, And how. Come on, fellows. Let's do some interior decorating.
,Squidward:, Oh. goodbye, paintbrush. Hello, antique fitting.
,Plankton:, Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while. ,[cut to later, SpongeBob and Patrick are taking apart the arch on the side of the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hup, hup, hup, hup. ,[they throw the arch up and it comes back down on their bodies. They carry it over to the Chum Bucket while Plankton goes to the Krusty Krab],
,Plankton:, I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick take the doors of the Krusty Krab apart and carry them back. Plankton walks inside. but when he hides behind a table, SpongeBob and Patrick take that with them. Then Plankton hides in the boat behind the cash register], Where could that stingy crab be? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick take the boat with them. Plankton laughs as he is hiding behind the grill, but SpongeBob and Patrick take the grill to the Chum Bucket. Then Plankton goes into Mr. Krabs office], Still don't see him. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick take Mr. Krabs' desk. Plankton gasps], The safe! I'm in the clear, baby! ,[squeezes inside the safe, then has a lantern and sees the secret formula], It's beautiful. ,[tears up], No, no tears. Not yet. ,[takes a deep breath], There's work to be done. ,[unscrews the bottle top], Ha-ha! At long last! ,[black and white crowd applauds], And the secret formula is—one bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe ,travel size,. This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list! ,[screams and tears it up. Turns into a little green hulk and bursts out of the safe. When he comes out, there is nothing but the safe left], Huh? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh? What happened to The Chum Bucket?! ,[The Chum Bucket turned into a replica of the Krusty Krab], Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.
,SpongeBob:, I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab.
,Mr. Krabs:, It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant. ,[steps out of a taxi with suitcases in hand and a hat on his head],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation. ,[the word ""Exposition!"" appears above SpongeBob's head],
,Mr. Krabs:, And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation. ,[He scuttles to the back of the building and as he grunts with effort, he pushes the Krusty Krab over to its original spot. Then flips it over to have the doors face the street],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hooray!/Yay!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[takes the safe out from his throat. It was covered with saliva. He takes out the formula for the patties], And I bet you tried to steal this, too.
,Plankton:, ,[chuckles sheepishly], Well, steal is such a strong word. ,[Mr. Krabs grabs him on the side of his eye. He screams in pain],
,Mr. Krabs:, You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. do you?
,Mr. Krabs and Plankton:, Now stay away from me....
,Plankton:, ...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors. ,[throws himself back at the Chum Bucket, but doesn't scream like he always does. He lets out a monotone scream. Plankton lands on the ground with a thud],
,Karen:, Oh. excellent job, genius. You really fixed the place up.
,Plankton:, Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day. ,[cut to later at the Krusty Krab where it's redecorated],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?
,Squidward:, That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of the Chum Bucket.
,Mr. Krabs:, And these metal decorations?
,Squidward:, Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls.
,Mr. Krabs:, And the computer? ,[SpongeBob is playing solitaire],
,Squidward:, Oh, that's Plankton's wife.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.
,Customer #1:, Wow, $25 for a Krabby Patty? Rip off, dude. Not cool.
,Mr. Krabs:, But you're paying for enhanced ambiance—dude.
,Customer #1:, Well, that's true—it is pretty classy in here. Give me four!

"[The episode begins with Squidward walking along the street],
,Squidward:, Maybe I'll do a cute little button. ,[Pulls his nose to give himself a button-nose. His nose pops out suddenly.], Or something a bit more manly perhaps. ,[pulls his nose hairs to create a mustache and a humanoid nose. His nose pops out back to normal suddenly], Upturned might be good, too. ,[Breathes in, puts his thumb into his mouth, and then blows. He gets an upturned nose. Just then, SpongeBob appears in his unicycle.],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Great. ,[slaps himself], The idiot found me.
,SpongeBob:, Whatcha doing?
,Squidward:, I'm picking a nose.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out.
,[SpongeBob lifts his nose and sticks his hand in it.],
,Squidward:, I'm not picking my nose, SpongeBob. I'm on the way to the hospital for a nose job. Plastic surgery. I'm finally gonna get the nose I should have been born with.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a... ,[freaks out when he sees how hideously disgusting Squidward's nose is up close], Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?
,Squidward:, With you? Absolutely not.
,SpongeBob:, Aww, come on, Squidward. ,[pedals off and comes back with a trashcan attached to his unicycle], I can get you there lickety-split.
,[SpongeBob stuffs Squidward into the trashcan. Then he puts on a siren and pedals to the hospital at a fast pace, causing them to crash into the check-in desk.],
,Nurse:, You can't dump your garbage here, sir.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in.
,[SpongeBob removes the trashcan off of Squidward and his nose is covered with garbage.],
,Nurse:, Holy nostroly! You must be here for the nose job. Let's, uh, get your paperwork filled out.
,[The scene changes to Squidward hooked up to the IV.],
,Surgeon:, You just relax, sir. The doctor will be ready for you soon.
,Squidward:, ,[inhales deeply], Ah. This is nice.
,SpongeBob:, Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home.
,French Narrator:, Five minutes later...
,[Squidward's room is filled with balloons, teddy bears and get well cards.],
,Squidward:, ,[grunts as he pops out of his pile of teddy bears], SpongeBob, get this garbage out of here! I can hardly move!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help.
,[SpongeBob pushes the bed's buttons and the bed folds Squidward into the mattress. It also made Squidward get stuck into a teddy bear.],
,Teddy Bear:, I love you.
,Squidward:, ,[grunts as he rips the teddy off of him], The bed is fine!
,SpongeBob:, Fluff your pillow?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, Fluff your IV bag?
,[SpongeBob fluffs the IV bag, which makes Squidward's head buff up and down.],
,Squidward:, Enough, you buffoon!
,SpongeBob:, Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful.
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], If you want to help so badly, why don't you just go volunteer to be a candy striper? There's plenty of other people in the hospital you could torture.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve.
,[SpongeBob runs out of the room. Squidward's bed folds up again.],
,SpongeBob:, Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—
,Nurse:, Grab a uniform out of the closet.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo! ,[runs into the closet and comes back out with a uniform], Ooh! Candy stripes. ,[slurps on the strips], Strawberry.
,Purple Doctor:, Ah, Doctor, thank goodness you're here.
,Green Doctor:, We were just looking for another physician to join us on our rounds.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the doctors at a patient's room.],
,Green Doctor:, And what seems to be the problem today?
,Catfish:, ,[coughing], My throat hurts.
,Purple Doctor:, Prescribe him a numbing throat spray. Let's move on, shall we?
,SpongeBob:, Wait a second! I think I've seen this before. ,[rubs his finger all over the catfish and abstracts some filth], Mm, yeah. ,[licks the filth], Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken.
,[The purple doctor takes a sea-chicken out of the first aid kit. SpongeBob plucks one of the feathers and the chicken flies out through the window. SpongeBob tickles the catfish with the feather, which makes him cough up his keys.],
,Catfish:, Hey, my keys. And my throat feels better.
,SpongeBob:, You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time. ,[grunts as he pulls out a pen, pencil and paintbrush from his head], Mm-hmm. ,[picks a pen and writes something down on a paper], Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys.
,Catfish:, Thanks, doc.
,SpongeBob:, No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the doctors at another patient's room.],
,Purple Doctor:, What treatment might you prescribe for this next patient, Doctor?
,[The green doctor shows SpongeBob the x-ray of the patient's broken legs.],
,Runner:, So what do you think? Will I be able to run in the Bikini Bottom marathon next week?
,Green Doctor:, Oh, my, no. I'm afraid you're—
,SpongeBob:, Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time. ,[looks around and sees a skeleton], Ah!
,[SpongeBob grabs the skeleton and lifts up the runner.],
,Runner:, What are you—
,[SpongeBob shakes the broken bones out of the runner's body and stuffs the skeleton inside him.],
,Purple Doctor:, Most unorthodox.
,Green Doctor:, He's a genius.
,[The runner appears to be good as new. Except that his head and feet are facing the wrong direction.],
,Runner:, Thanks, doc.
,SpongeBob:, Ready, set. ,[blows blowhorn as the runner runs out backwards],
,[The scene changes to the doctors talking to Mrs. Puff hooked up to the iron lung.],
,Green Doctor:, And what seems to be your problem today, ma'am?
,Mrs. Puff:, Sometimes, I just don't have it in me to puff up under my own power.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, No! Not you! ,[whimpers], What are you doing here?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine. ,[climbs through the iron lung],
,Purple Doctor:, You're kidding of course. We've placed her in an iron lung to help puff her back up.
,SpongeBob:, Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes. ,[imitates airplane and laughs],
,[SpongeBob accidentally kicks the lever with his foot, making the iron lung move.],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[whispers], Help me! ,[screams],
,[The iron lung rolls down the hallway.],
,Unnamed doctor:, Hey!
,[All the doctors and patients panic as the iron lung rolls through the hall, crashing into several people, including the runner in the process.],
,Runner:, My legs!
,SpongeBob:, Never fear, Mrs. Puff. I haven't lost a patient all day. ,[puts on medical goggles], Let's get medical.
,[SpongeBob drives the iron lung with the levers, making Mrs. Puff get her puff back in shape. SpongeBob screams as he notices that he is about to crash into the windows. He tries to slow the machine down, but breaks the levers.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no.
,[The iron lung crashes into the two windows, pushing Mrs. Puff out. Mrs. Puff inflates as her puff is now fully back in shape.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh. Actually, I feel like my old self again. But you still don't get a driver's license. ,[shrinks down to normal size and falls to the ground], Oh!
,Purple Doctor:, Wow. I've never seen anyone work an iron lung like that.
,Green Doctor:, So awesome.
,[The two doctors high-five.],
,Purple Doctor:, We were on our way to perform a surgery...
,Green Doctor:, But we would be honored to watch you perform it.
,SpongeBob:, Me? Perform a surgery?
,[Meanwhile at the operation theater, Squidward is getting ready for his nose job.],
,Squidward:, Oh, yeah, this is the life. And best of all, there's no SpongeBob here to ruin it.
,[The two doctors and SpongeBob arrive in the operation theater.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, boy, surgery! And on my first day too.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? No! What are you doing here?
,Surgeon:, Nighty night, Mr. Tentacles.
,Squidward:, Wait, wait, no, no, no, no!
,[The surgeon puts Squidward to sleep with anesthesia.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, everybody.
,Doctors and surgeons:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,Purple Doctor:, Doctor, the patient's over here, and he's ready for you to begin.
,Green Doctor:, Oh, we're most eager to see which tool you select first.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks for a tool], Hmm, mm—mm—mm—mm. Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Phew. ,[picks up a spatula], Here we go!
,[SpongeBob twirls his spatula around for a few moments, impressing the doctors and surgeons.],
,Doctors and surgeons:, Oh! Ah!
,[SpongeBob goes to do Squidward's nose job.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, SpongeBob, this can't be too hard. Just make an incision here, and— ,[operates with the spatula and ink sprays up], no! Shoot! ,[the heart flips], Son of a gun! ,[continues to work, but breaks Squidward's foot off], Ah, my bad.
,Surgeon:, I'll take that. ,[takes the foot],
,SpongeBob:, Ah-ha! ,[chops with spatula and makes sushi], Mmm, sushi.
,[The surgeon takes the sushi and SpongeBob pulls out a saw. SpongeBob performs the operation with a saw, but breaks it. SpongeBob gets creeped out when he notices that he just sawed Squidward in half. The surgeon moves Squidward's head to another bed where the rest of his body is being placed.],
,SpongeBob:, He's, uh, really going to pieces over this nose job.
,[The doctors and surgeons laugh.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, ,[chuckles], Thank you! Let's try again, shall we?
,[SpongeBob resumes the operation and creates a patty with Squidward's tentacle in it.],
,SpongeBob:, Order up!
,[The doctors and surgeons applaud and laugh. SpongeBob hops onto Squidward's bed and lifts his nose up. In the nostril, there's a blue ribbon in it.],
,SpongeBob:, Yow! That shouldn't be in there. ,[pulls ribbon and sees another one], Ooh! ,[pulls more ribbons out and a clipboard],
,Yellow Doctor:, What? ,[notices his clipboard is missing], Oh.
,SpongeBob:, Ta-da!
,[The doctors and surgeons applaud. SpongeBob is seen stitching Squidward's nose together.],
,SpongeBob:, Nurse, sponge.
,[The surgeon clips part of SpongeBob's head and wipe the sweat off. The sponge jumps back into the place it was clipped off.],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, nurse.
,Gray Doctor:, I can't see! I can't see! I want to see!
,[The gray doctor jumps out of the window and falls into Squidward's nose.],
,Gray Doctor:, I still can't see.
,[The gray doctor runs around to operating room, dragging Squidward all over the place. SpongeBob stops the gray doctor from running around and sends him flying back into the balcony with the spatula. The pink doctor catches the gray doctor with a catcher's mitt.],
,SpongeBob:, Ta-da!
,[The doctors and surgeons applaud. SpongeBob resumes the operation and gives the finishing touches.],
,SpongeBob:, There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse.
,Squidward:, ,[wakes up and groans], What—what happened?
,SpongeBob:, I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look.
,[SpongeBob pulls out a mirror and Squidward looks at his reflection. His nose appears to be bigger than it was before.],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, you idiot! This isn't even close to what I wanted!
,SpongeBob:, Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!
,Squidward:, Wait, no, no, no! I want a different doctor! I—
,[The surgeon puts Squidward to sleep with anesthesia again. He wakes up again and looks at his reflection again. He has three noses instead of one.],
,Squidward:, No! ,[with a noisemaker], No! ,[with an elephant's trunk], No! ,[with clarinet], No! ,[with crabs nose], No! ,[with log], No! ,[with the face of Squilliam Fancyson], No! ,[with a reindeer's head], No! ,[with his house], No! ,[with real life octopus], No! ,[with car engine and it flares up], No-o-o-o! ,[sobbing],
,[SpongeBob snaps his fingers. Squidward wakes up for the final time.],
,Squidward:, Stop! I don't want to change my nose anymore! SpongeBob, I'll do anything! Anything at—
,SpongeBob:, How's about the Squidward Classic?
,[SpongeBob holds up the mirror and Squidward's nose is back to how it was.],
,Squidward:, Hey, not bad. This looks even better than my old nose.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it.
,[Squidward appears to be missing his arms and legs.],
,SpongeBob:, D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work. ,[takes off his surgery outfit],
,Purple Doctor:, But you're a doctor. You're at work.
,SpongeBob:, No, I'm just a fry cook. ,[puts on Krusty Krab hat], But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye! ,[leaves],
,Purple Doctor:, Fry cook? Ooh. ,[faints in the green doctor's arms],
,Squidward:, Don't be afraid, ladies. This sinus Adonis is on the market.
,[The two surgeons gasp and shiver.],

"[scene starts with Squidward leaving his house on a bicycle while he hums a tune],
,Squidward:, There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. ,[starts riding his bicycle to work and passes a tall piece of stalk with a treehouse on top of it with SpongeBob and Patrick in it],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[giggling],
,SpongeBob:, Wey, wook. It's Widward!
,Squidward:, What?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Widward's woing to work.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, ,[growls],
,Patrick:, Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?
,SpongeBob:, We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
,Squidward:, Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron? ,[laughs], Moron... ,[laughs again], as a requirement. ,[laughs again],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
,Squidward:, Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
,Patrick:, ,[whispering to SpongeBob], What did he say?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispering to Patrick], I don't know. Something about his nose?
,Patrick:, ,[sticks his head out of the ""Clubhouse"" and talks to Squidward], Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!
,Squidward:, Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in? ,[takes off his hat and starts to climb up the ""Clubhouse""], Why, you should be begging me to join!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
,[Squidward grunts as he tries to get in the ""Clubhouse""],
,Squidward:, Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
,Patrick:, That's what we've been trying to tell you!
,SpongeBob:, We've been stuck up here for three days.
,Patrick:, We told you you wouldn't fit in.
,Squidward:, ,[sneers],
,SpongeBob:, Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Ready!

He starts screaming],
,Nancy:, Whoa!
,Frank:, Make a wish, honey.
,[Squidward continues screaming. The ""Clubhouse"" falls into the Kelp Forest],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again! ,[they victory screech,]
,Squidward:, Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!

,[SpongeBob shrugs. Squidward runs around the ""Clubhouse""],
,Squidward:, Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick wave at Squidward who starts crying],
,Squidward:, Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse.

,SpongeBob:, And besides, we have ,this! [pulls out a conch shell],
,Squidward:, What's that?
,Patrick:, Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
,SpongeBob:, Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? ,[pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch],
,Magic Conch:, Maybe someday.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[giggling], Oooohhhh!
,Squidward:, You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
,Patrick:, The shell knows all!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
,Magic Conch:, Nothing.
,Patrick:, The shell has spoken!
,Squidward:, Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!

I'm gonna find my way back to sanity! ,[starts walking away in the Kelp Forest], But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns... ,[laughs], sad... ,[laughs again], clowns. ,[laughs again. Later, he begins to run fast and scared while panting], What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost! ,[trips and falls], Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here! ,[sees light], Huh? ,[laughing. He goes toward the light], I'm ,free!, Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick! ,[pumps fists in the air and starts laughing triumphantly but sees SpongeBob and Patrick], Huh? Ohhh... ,[falls on the ground], there's no way out of here. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still doing nothing. A stick is thrown at Patrick's head. Squidward is putting a pan over a fire], How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight? ,[spots a bug running around so he steps on it], Ah... ,[puts the bug on the pan and walks over to SpongeBob and waves the pan over his nose], Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days. ,[walks over to Patrick], How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any. ,[walks away from Patrick], And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell! ,[shakes his butt in SpongeBob's face], If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam... ,[moves back to Club Squidward], that tells you nothing! ,[stirs the pan], As if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky! ,[laughs], Fall right out of the sky! ,[camera switches to an airplane falling out of the sky],
,Scooter:, Dude, we're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load! ,[presses the ""Drop the Load"" button. The airplane drops picnic supplies to where SpongeBob and Patrick are],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Praise the Magic Conch! ,[victory screech. Squidward stares shockingly. The bug gets up, hits him with the stick, and runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick eat. SpongeBob eats two hamburgers. Patrick eating a whole turkey in one bite. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are drinking, SpongeBob is drinking a can of soda and Patrick is drinking a bottle of ketchup. They laugh and Squidward goes to them],
,Squidward:, Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
,SpongeBob:, It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
,Squidward:, Everything sure looks delicious. ,[gasps], Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite! ,[smells them but Patrick sucks them in and Squidward's nose too. He pulls his nose out], Uh, hey, uh, ,[laughs], SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um... ,[stammers], ,[While he is saying all this, SpongeBob is eating a cookie and is drinking a glass of orange juice],

,Squidward:, Umm...uh..yeah?
,SpongeBob:, Once a member, always a member!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[clink glasses], To the club! ,[victory screech],
,Squidward:, Yeah. ,[mimics the victory screech, weakly], Now, uh, if you'll excuse me... ,[runs to the table with all the food], All right... What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
,SpongeBob:, Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
,[Squidward prepares to eat but SpongeBob and Patrick pull the table away and block it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.
,Patrick:, ,[whispering], Maybe he's not a brother.
,[SpongeBob looks at Squidward wide-eyed],
,Squidward:, ,[chuckles], Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic. ,[takes the Magic Conch from SpongeBob], Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
,Magic Conch:, Neither.
,Squidward:, Oh. Then how about the soup?
,Magic Conch:, I don't think so.
,Squidward:, ,[becomes annoyed], Could I have anything to eat?
,Magic Conch:, No.
,Squidward:, No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
,Patrick:, ,[takes Magic Conch], Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
,Magic Conch:, No.
,Patrick:, Hmm... ,[happily], Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
,Magic Conch:, Yes.
,Patrick:, All right! ,[vacuums in the sandwich and burps], Sorry, Squidward.

,Patrick:, Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
,Kelp Forest Ranger:, ,[offscreen], Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Hello?! ,[he reveals himself after he cuts through the kelp. He gasps and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward dirty], Do you folks need some help?
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], I'm ,saved!, ,[runs over to the forest ranger], You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!

,Magic Conch:, Nothing.
,SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger:, All hail the Magic Conch! ,[they sit down doing nothing. Squidward, still dumbstruck, moves in between them],

,Sandals:, What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?
,Squidward:, No. What will you have?
,Sandals:, Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?
,Squidward:, ,[He finally loses his temper and he throws the paper and pencil in anger], Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Pokes his head out from behind the kitchen window], Psst, try the coral bits.
,Sandals:, Uhh, I'll try the coral bits.
,Squidward:, That'll be one dollar. ,[Rings up one dollar then a siren goes off],
,Sandals:, What's going on?
,Squidward:, Something stupid, I'm sure. ,[Alarm stops as a curtain opens up to show a real band in the background playing carnival music. Mr. Krabs comes out from the restroom, cheering],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yippee! ,[Kisses Sandals and Squidward. Takes the dollar and laughs hysterically as he rubs it all over himself], Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!
,Squidward:, See? I told you.
,SpongeBob:, What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Looks weird as he runs over to the counter], Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!
,Squidward:, A very dirty dollar?
,Mr. Krabs:, No! This is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir. You have just given me my one millionth dollar.

,Mr. Krabs:, Nothing. Now get out.
,Sandals:, Uhh, what?
,Mr. Krabs:, Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment! ,[Pushes everyone out the door], Me millionth dollar.
,SpongeBob:, Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you ,[He imagines SpongeBob and Squidward looking deformed], comes around maybe once in a lifetime. And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, a trip!
,Squidward:, I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where we going, Fancy Springs?
,[Scene cuts to the three of them in a pool],
,Mr. Krabs:, No.
,Squidward:, Pamper Island?

,Squidward:, Clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work? ,[Clams are jumping], Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?
,Mr. Krabs:, Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams ,[Catches a clam then he throws it back], then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?
,Squidward:, No. ,[Takes off his raincoat and sits on his chair], And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.
,SpongeBob:, Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?
,Squidward:, How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[SpongeBob casts his line behind him which catches on Squidward's magazine. SpongeBob brings his line forward and casts it in the lagoon. SpongeBob casts Squidward's chair],
,Squidward:, Hey, watch where you're swinging that... ,[SpongeBob casts Squidward's shirt out in the lagoon], SpongeBob, be careful with... ow! ,[SpongeBob casts Squidward's nose into the lagoon. Squidward screams loudly in pain, then walks up to Mr. Krabs], Okay, I've had enough.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Laughs], Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up. ,[SpongeBob is still casting out items while Mr. Krabs talks to Squidward], Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose. ,[Laughs. The hook in SpongeBob's fishing rod touches Mr. Krabs millionth dollar. Gasps], Me millionth dollar! ,[SpongeBob rips Mr. Krabs' pants off and casts his dollar to the lagoon], SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya. ,[Music plays], Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in. Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster! ,[SpongeBob reels it in as fast as he can. Mr. Krabs opens the doors to the orchestra], There you are, ya stinkin' bilge rats! ,[to the trumpeters], Stop playing that music! ,[to the conductor], Stop it, please! ,[to the violinists], I'm begging ya!

It takes a while for Mr. Krabs to notice his dollar isn't in his claw anymore. The clam swims away. The scene cuts as Mr. Krabs’ eyes well up with tears, and he begins to cry],
,Squidward:, So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Squidward! You're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar! ,[sobbing and flops to the ground], I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back! ,[Whips his eyes against the floor], Never, never, never, never, never!
,SpongeBob:, I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up. ,[Mr. Krabs is literally in pieces, crying],
,Squidward:, Oh, puh-lease, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act. ,[Mr. Krabs is crying while sucking his feet], Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar. ,[Mr. Krabs continues weeping as he pours tears into his mouth], For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up! ,[Mr. Krabs' eyes inflate then squirt out tears], Mr. Krabs... ,[Mr. Krabs is wailing like a fountain], Mr. Krabs... ,[Mr. Krabs is sobbing like a faucet. Squidward has had enough.], Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Sucks on a thumb then he throws it away], You will? Great! Wait right here. ,[Runs off to get some items and comes back with a bunch of fishing gear on], Here's where clam fishing gets serious. ,[Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is on top of the boat and SpongeBob and Squidward are on the lower deck], Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Salutes], Aye aye, captain!
,Mr. Krabs:, And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar. ,[Mr. Krabs scouts the area. Scene cuts to later where Mr. Krabs has a beard on from scouting for too long. Squidward and SpongeBob look the same as Mr. Krabs],
,Squidward:, ,[Ripping off his beard], That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary. ,[Scene cuts to Gary chewing up SpongeBob's couch at home],
,Squidward:, We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar! ,[Takes a dollar out of his wallet], Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I get ya. ,[Jabbers. Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is still scouting the area],
,SpongeBob & Squidward:, Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! ,[Mr. Krabs steers his eyes toward the other two to see them waving a dollar], Look what we've got!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Jumps down and gasps], Could it be? ,[Takes the dollar], Me millionth dollar? ,[Starts cheering again as well as SpongeBob and Squidward], Whoo-hoo! ,[Rubs the dollar on himself but he notices something strange so he stops dancing], Wait a minute... ,[Rubs the dollar back and forth again and points at the dollar], This isn't me millionth dollar. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other], This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, ,[Shows dollar bill just like described], and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.
,SpongeBob:, ,[wearing blue lipstick], Actually, it's Coral Blue number- ,[Squidward whacks him on the head with a fishing rod to shut him up, but it's already too late], three.
,Mr. Krabs:, I trusted you, and you gave me this? I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this. ,[sobs],
,Squidward:, No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stops sobbing, then narrows his eyes], I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.
,Squidward:, You're kidding?
,SpongeBob:, Woo! Is it another fishing trip?
,Mr. Krabs:, No. It's this sandwich. ,[Nails the sandwich to a pole],
,Squidward:, A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not ,a, sandwich. ,[throws the other sandwiches into the lagoon], ,The, sandwich.
,Squidward:, Whatever. We've got plenty more to... ,[He and SpongeBob get shocked. Mr. Krabs throws the refrigerator into the lagoon], ...eat.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back.
,Squidward:, Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone completely insane?!
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean?
,Squidward:, Just look at him. ,[Pointing to Mr. Krabs, who is dressed like he is at a funeral sobbing at a tombstone with the words 'R.I.P. Me Millionth Dollar' on it. He then hugs it.],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you—
,Squidward:, Look again. ,[Mr. Krabs uses his eyes as a jump rope while giggling],
,SpongeBob:, ,[now visibly scared], You're right. How do we get outta here?
,Squidward:, If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[Both take a step, then start screaming as they sprint over to the lifeboat. They jump into it but then come back onto the boat tied up; Mr. Krabs pops his head out of the lifeboat],
,Mr. Krabs:, So, you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. ""It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice."" ,[sobs], Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you: ,[Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs hanging his line over the boat. SpongeBob and Squidward are attached to the line], live bait!
,Squidward:, You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Dressed up as a conductor], Oh, he'll come. ,[Taps the book using his baton and the doors open up to the orchestra and begins to play the ominous music; SpongeBob and Squidward shake and scream in terror],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say... ,[Yells], you are completely out of your mind! ,[Mr. Krabs giggles madly while conducting the orchestra. The giant clam emerges above the lagoon coming closer to the two on the line], Get us out of here!
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, fresh meat! ,[SpongeBob and Squidward scream as they try to wiggle back and forth to avoid the giant clam], Keep thrashing! He likes it! ,[Both continue to scream and bounce up and down really fast], Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there. ,[Giant clam shows the dollar on its tongue], That's it! ,[Closes the doors to cause the music to stop. The giant clam stops in mid-air and Mr. Krabs jumps inside it to take the dollar], Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it! ,[Rubs his dollar on himself], I finally got me millionth dollar! ,[Cabin doors open to play the ominous music again. The giant clam closes its mouth, with Mr. Krabs inside, and dives into the lagoon. Cabin doors close as the conductor takes a bow to the applauding audience],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives... ,[A tear falls down his cheek], Why couldn't it have been me?!
,Squidward:, Yes, why couldn't it have been you?! ,[Sobbing],
,SpongeBob:, Why did he have to go like this?! Why? ,[Crying],
,Squidward:, Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?! ,[Both sob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hello, boys. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward stop sobbing],
,SpongeBob & Squidward:, Mr. Krabs? ,[Mr. Krabs' head is above the lagoon],
,Mr. Krabs:, Have you boys met... ,[Holds his millionth dollar up], ...me millionth dollar? ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, how did you get it back?
,Mr. Krabs:, It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter. So, eventually, we settled on a trade.
,SpongeBob:, What did you give him? ,[Mr. Krabs jumps back up on the boat, revealing himself as only having a head and an arm],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nothing important. ,[Laughs. SpongeBob and Squidward look shocked.],

,SpongeBob: I'm trying, Squidward, but clocking out is the most upsetting part of the day! ,[Squidward slaps himself in the face], At least soon, I'll be home where I can relive all the wonderful moments from my day at work. ,[Flashback, in SpongeBob's house, where he's cooking Krabby Patties, with a bag of flour dressed like Mr. Krabs standing right next to him], I'm all over it, boss man!

,Squidward: ,Geez SpongeBob, I hadn't thought of that! You're right! I quit. ,(Episode cuts to Squidward entering the Chum Bucket), Eh, a bit industrial, but I can make it work. ,(Episode cuts to the Chum Bucket kitchen), You call this a kitchen? We should start by tearing out this wall so the chef is visible to his adoring fans!,
,Squidward:I don't see any use for all these old flap traps. We should just break them down for parts. (Squidward tears out the traps)
,Plankton: But, but that's my chum-fueled antennae massager!
,Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry! Remind me, who's in complete creative control here?

,Plankton:, Frica-what?,
,Squidward: ,See, Plankton, there's a trick to making chum edible., (Squidward smells the bad stench of chum), We just have to follow old Grandma Tentacles's secret fricassee recipe.,
,Plankton: Secret recipe, you say, huh? ,[Plankton pulls out a pencil and pad], What's in it?
,Squidward: ,Nice try, tiny Cyclops. You won't get Grandma's delicate mix of seasonings and spices that easily, but preparation cannot be rushed. Each batch must simmer for exactly 24 hours.,
,French Narrator:, Twenty-Four hours later.... (24 hours later, Plankton is sleeping when Squidward puts a scoop of chum fricassee on his plate),

,SpongeBob:, Mmm! ,[eats the bubble hot dog and suds foam out; burps loudly], Oh, yeah! I am rabid for these dogs! ,[laughs], Huh? Hey, it's my old pal, Bubble Buddy! Hiya, Bubble Buddy!
,Bubble Buddy:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Gee, it's good to see ya! ,[hugs Bubble Buddy really tight],
,Bubble Buddy:, Whoa! ,[groans as SpongeBob accidentally splits his body in half],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, oops. Sorry.
,Bubble Buddy:, Oh, don't worry about it.
,SpongeBob:, So, how you been? How are things?
,Bubble Buddy:, Oh. Not so good, SpongeBob. On my way into town, I got a flat tire on my motor scooter. ,[shows his motor scooter's front flat tire],
,SpongeBob:, Let me see if I can fix that for you.
,[SpongeBob takes his shoe off, pulls out a bubble wand, dips it in a bottle of soap, and blows the motor scooter into a motorcycle.],
,SpongeBob:, Ta-da!
,Bubble Buddy:, All right!
,Bubble Man #1:, Say, that was some pretty handy bubble work you did there, son.
,Bubble Buddy:, Why, SpongeBob is the best bubble blower I know. He can inflate and create anything!
,Bubble Man #1:, You don't say? Hey, can you help me? I've got a small leak in my roof. ,[shows his roofless bubble house as a bubble raincloud rains down],
,Bubble Wife:, Honey! ,[screams],
,SpongeBob:, I can help you? By blowing bubbles? Oh...,[sighs and faints],
,Bubble Buddy:, And...clear! ,[zaps him with the bubble defibrillator],
,SpongeBob:, Count me in!
,Bubble Man #1:, Fantastic!
,Bubble Man #2:, Say, when you're done helping him, my house could use a new rec room!
,[SpongeBob is writing a list down on his clipboard.],
,Bubble Lady #1:, I need some pajamas.
,SpongeBob:, ,[writes it down], Okay, mm, uh-huh.
,Bubble Man #3:, I want another sandwich!
,[SpongeBob writes it down.],
,Bubble Man #4:, Monster truck tires!
,SpongeBob:, ,[writes it down], Never fear, people of Bubbletown! I'm on it!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob, wearing bubble spurs and a bubble cowboy hat, makes a western cowboy stance as he looks upon Bubbletown. The bubble straw he was chewing on pops in his face. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand and bottle of soap. He dips the wand in the soap, blows a really big bubble, and creates a brand new house for one bubble person.],
,Bubble Man #1:, Wow! Thanks, SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob blows some bubbles and forms giant monster truck tires for one bubble person's bubble car.],
,Bubble Man #4:, All right! ,[drives his bubble monster truck away],
,[SpongeBob blows some more bubbles. The bubbles hit an disgruntled old bubble man with a sore back and forms a scooter for him to ride on. The old bubble man was so happy that he begins riding in his new scooter. SpongeBob then dances around in a happy dance and forms bubble flowers all over the place.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Bubble Buddy, this has been the best day of my life! I love it here in Bubbletown! ,[laughs and bounces uncontrollably],
,Bubble Buddy:, Watch out for those—
,[SpongeBob crashes into something off-screen.],
,Bubble Lady #2:, Excuse me, sir, but you seem to have stepped in my dogs.
,[SpongeBob looks down and sees two bubble dogs in his feet.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh-uh, pardon me, ma'am. Let me just—
,[SpongeBob attempts to remove his feet out from the bubble dogs, but he slips and pops them underneath him. The dogs are now reduced to a puddle and the bubble lady gasps in horror.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! ,[slips on the suds and lands on the bubble lady, which resulted it getting soap in his eyes], Whoa! ,[wails in pain], My eyes! ,[screams as he slips uncontrollably],
,Bubble Buddy:, SpongeBob, come back!
,Bubble Groom:, Amy, will you marry me? ,[holds out a bubble ring],
,Amy:, Yes! I will!
,[SpongeBob slips into Amy and accidentally pops her.],
,Bubble Groom:, Aw. ,[begins to sulk, but SpongeBob slips into him and accidentally pops him],
,[The bubble ring pops in mid-air. SpongeBob skids out of control and accidentally pops a line of bubble ducklings and a bubble duck. He then pops some of the bubble buildings in Bubbletown. The scene changes to the bubble mayor giving a grand opening to a new bubble elementary school for bubble children.],
,Bubble mayor:, I now dedicate this new school for overly cute children.
,[The bubble crowd cheers.],
,Little bubble boy:, I wuv to learn!
,[SpongeBob screams as he continue to slip on the suds. Just as the bubble mayor was about to cut the bubble ribbon, SpongeBob slips past him and pops it.],
,Bubble mayor:, Hey! That was my job! ,[gets accidentally popped by SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, I'm so sorry! I can't stop!
,[SpongeBob accidentally pops the little bubble boy with his shoe, causing the bubble crowd to gasp.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[slow-motion], Watch out! ,[accidentally pops the bubble crowd and the new bubble elementary school],
,[SpongeBob continues to skid out of control.],
,Bubble Buddy:, SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob slips into the Bubbletown's bubble sign, bumps into a rock and lands near the shore. He lays flat on his face and cries.],
,Bubble Buddy:, SpongeBob! Oh thank goodness, you're okay.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets up], No! Stay away! ,[shows his face covered in sand, shells, and sticks], I'm a monster! ,[whimpers], A monster! ,[Bubble Buddy gasps], Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!
,[Bubbletown is now a complete mess from the destruction SpongeBob accidentally caused.],
,Bubble Fred:, My bubble legs!
,Bubble Man #4:, ,[his bubble monster truck's tires pop], My monster truck tires! ,[his bubble monster truck pops],
,Bubble Buddy:, Okay, that doesn't look great. ,[uneasy chuckle], But I'm sure we can get it all sorted out.
,[A bubble police car arrives and pops, revealing a bubble police officer.],
,Bubble police officer:, I'm afraid the only sorting out your friend's going to be doing is in jail. For popping a large portion of the city.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me.
,[The bubble police officer handcuffs him with bubble handcuffs. The scene changes to Bubbletown Prison. The bubble police officer gives SpongeBob the bubble telephone.],
,Bubble police officer:, All right, you get one phone call.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[dials the number on the bubble telephone; the line thrills and a recorded voice is going], The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second. ,[the bubble telephone beeps; as he talks through the bubble telephone, it forms into a big bubble], Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um...,[sniffs], I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry! ,[pushes the bubble message out the bubble window of Bubbletown Prison and cries],
,French Narrator:, Later…
,[Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs comes out from his office and is shocked to see a long line of starving customers. Squidward is sleeping one the cash register.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[yells loudly in Squidward's face], Mr. Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[pulls his hat off to straighten out his face], Huh, hah, what, who?
,Mr. Krabs:, What's going on here? How long have these folks been waiting to give me their money?
,[Old Man Jenkins passes out and dies. His angel begins to exit his body, but he grabs it and stuffs it back in.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, I'm okay!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well…?
,Squidward:, What's the point? There's no one in the kitchen to make any food.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[peaks into the kitchen and looks around; talks high-pitched], What?! Where's SpongeBob? Didn't he call in?
,[Just then, SpongeBob's bubble message floats in and an image of SpongeBob appears on it as it breaks air.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me—,[Mr. Krabs pops the bubble message before it finishes],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, barnacles. Me fry cook's in the clink. You have the conn, Mr. Squidward. I'll be back as soon as I can! ,[runs out to go rescue SpongeBob from Bubbletown Prison],
,Customers:, Wha—whoa. ,[fall over like domino blocks],
,[Back at Bubbletown Prison, SpongeBob is lifting weights with some bubble prisoners. All of a sudden, Mr. Krabs appears and pops Bubbletown Prison wall, which resulted in freeing some bubble prisoners including the Dirty Bubble.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[hugs Mr. Krabs], Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pulls SpongeBob off], This is a prison break, boy-o. Let's get a move on! We've got a bunch of hungry customers back home, and I need your help fleecing—I mean, I mean feeding them!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stammers], Can't go? When I say we're leaving, we're leaving!
,Bubble police officer:, Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
,Mr. Krabs:, Eat claw, bubble cop!
,[Mr. Krabs clamps his claws and spins around and around like a helicopter.],
,Bubble police officer:, Uh-huh?
,[Mr. Krabs flies over towards to bubble police officer and chases him in the Bubbletown Prison. Mr. Krabs' sharp claws proceeds to pops everything into Bubbletown Prison and completely destroys it. He then destroys a bubble house's roof.],
,Bubble Wife:, Honey!
,[Mr. Krabs spins uncontrollably and continuously pops all of Bubbletown until everything is nothing more than puddles of suds. The last thing he pops is a small bubble duckling, which he falls on top off.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs], Good thing they were all just bubbles, eh? Okay, let's get out of here. ,[pulls off SpongeBob's face by accident], Uh-oh. ,[pastes it back on him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[falls to the ground in complete shock], You popped it all. ,[his eyes tear up], There's nothing left!
,Mr. Krabs:, Forget it, SpongeBob. It's Bubbletown.
,SpongeBob:, No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved. ,[his tears form a replica of Bubbletown on the ground as he sobs],
,Bubble Buddy:, ,[shows up with a big bottle of soap], So sorry to interrupt, but I might have a solution that works for everyone!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Oh, yeah!
,Bubble Buddy:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, ,[pops out a variety of bubble wands], Let's blow this popsicle stand. ,[laughs],
,[The scene changes to newly blow Bubbletown. Bubbletown now has a new location that looks almost similar to the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom. It is known as the Bubbly Krab. The bubble groom drives away with Amy, his newly wedded bubble wife. In the Bubbly Krab, SpongeBob is wearing a bubble hat similar to the hat he wears at the Krusty Krab and is holding a bubble spatula.],
,Bubble Buddy:, I can't believe how quickly you inflated the whole city again, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab. ,[shows all the bubble customers eating Bubble Patties],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs as he is counting bubble money in the Bubbly Krab cash register], Yeah! Franchisin's a great idea, boy-o! ,[opens the bubble cash register and pops out bubble money], I am making money claw over fist here. ,[stuffs the bubble money in the bubble cash register], Hey, what's the exchange rate for bubbles to real money?
,Bubble Buddy:, There is none! ,[laughs along with SpongeBob],
,[All the bubble customers laugh as well.],
,Bubble customers:, Exchange rate? ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's it. We're done here. ,[pops the Bubbly Krab, picks up SpongeBob, and leaves Bubbletown in disgust],
,SpongeBob:, Huh. ,[giggles],
,[Bubble ducks walk by with a little bubble boy.],
,Little bubble boy:, I wuv to learn!

"SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob walks outside his house, and breathes in the fresh air], Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. ,[SpongeBob immediately grabs wood, a hammer, and some nails, and starts to noisily build a stand. Squidward peeks his head out the window],
,Squidward:, Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[he taps on a nail lightly, and he looks up at Squidward's window. He does it again, and continues to, making sure he doesn't make too much noise. Meanwhile, in Squidward's house, Squidward has his clarinet in hand],
,Squidward:, And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you. ,[He starts to play. SpongeBob looks up and sees that Squidward is playing, so he decides to finish his stand quickly. Squidward looks out the window again.],
,Squidward:, I thought I... Wha?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
,Squidward:, Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
,SpongeBob:, Uh huh.
,Squidward:, Oh, puh-lease. I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles? ,[Patrick comes out of his house, stuck to the underside of the rock],
,Patrick:, Good morning. ,[he falls and screams],
,Squidward:, Oh, boy. ,[Patrick walks over to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
,Patrick:, Hmm, how much is it?
,SpongeBob:, Only a quarter.
,Patrick:, Sounds reasonable. ,[whispering], Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, Patrick. ,[he pulls out a quarter and he gives it to Patrick],
,Patrick:, Ah, one quarter. ,[he hands the quarter back to SpongeBob, and bites it to see if it's real],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you. ,[cuts back to Squidward],
,Squidward:, Hmm, business is booming. ,[he laughs], How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh. ,[he continues playing. Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob dips the wand in the bubble soap],
,SpongeBob:, One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go. ,[Patrick grabs the wand from SpongeBob, inhales deeply and begins to blow, but a bubble doesn't come out. He pants and blows again. After a while, SpongeBob puts up a ""Lessons"" sign. Patrick then loses his breath], Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
,Patrick:, Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter? ,[SpongeBob hands Patrick a quarter], Thanks. ,[he winks and hands the quarter back to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique. ,[he starts doing his infamous routine], First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... ,[he blows bubbles shaped like ducks],
,Patrick:, Oooh. ,[SpongeBob pops out of nowhere and blows a box. Patrick giggles and SpongeBob blows a caterpillar], Ah! ,[The caterpillar then pops one-by-one, with descending sounds. Patrick continues to giggle. SpongeBob blows a boat, and it floats off, pops, and makes a foghorn noise. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house],
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[he shakes his clarinet. Cut back to outside with SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, And now... with two hands! ,[he inhales deeply and blows out an elephant. Circus music, in particular part of the piece ""Entry of the Gladiators"", starts playing.],
,Patrick:, ,[Laughs], It's a giraffe! ,[Patrick continues laughing as the elephant floats over into Squidward's house. SpongeBob then frowns as the bubble pops and tons of smaller bubbles come out of both windows of the house while an elephant sounds. Squidward opens the door with a sour look on his face. SpongeBob and Patrick hide behind the stand. SpongeBob places a ""Closed"" sign on it. Squidward looks over the stand],
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
,Squidward:, Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
,SpongeBob:, We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art. Watch carefully. ,[he does his infamous routine again], First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... ,[he blows a butterfly, which flies over to Squidward, lands on his head, and pops],
,Squidward:, That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick, now depressed, head to SpongeBob's house], You should be ashamed of yourselves. ,[SpongeBob closes the door as Squidward laughs to himself], Bubbles. ,[he continues laughing], Art. ,[he mumbles, and picks up the bubble wand, sniffs it, and inhales to blow. Then, SpongeBob pops up out of nowhere],
,SpongeBob:, That'll be 25 cents, sir.
,Squidward:, Ah, whoa, what? ,[SpongeBob blinks], Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
,SpongeBob:, We also offer lessons for beginners. ,[he puts the ""Lessons"" sign up],
,Squidward:, Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble? ,[he pulls a quarter out], Here's your 25 cents! ,[SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real and it bends], Watch and learn. ,[he inhales and blows, but nothing happens], Uhh... wait, wait, wait. ,[he inhales and blows again, but nothing happens again], One more time. Here. Wait. ,[he inhales and blows again, and a small bubble comes out and instantly falls to the ground and bursts, making a raspberry sound. Looks over at SpongeBob and Patrick. They gulp, and then start whistling. Squidward places another quarter on the stand], Uhh... Just a mere warm-up. ,[he dips the wand in the bubble container, inhales deeply and blows hard. The bubble falls to the ground again, making another raspberry sound, gets another quarter out and puts it on the stand],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, remember the technique. ,[Squidward keeps trying to blow bubbles while SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to show him the technique], Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back....
,Patrick:, Hey! Technique, Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, Spin around like thi— Like this...  Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three...
,Patrick:, The pelvic woo!
,SpongeBob:, Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the ""Woooooo!"" Squidward?
,Patrick:, Listen to Sponge!
,SpongeBob:, Technique! Technique! Technique!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[while standing on one foot], Technique! Technique! Technique! Technique! Tech- ,[Squidward looks at them],
,SpongeBob:, ,[weakly], You're not doing the technique.
,Patrick:, Technique.
,Squidward:, Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique! ,[he starts to do the infamous routine, while imitating SpongeBob], First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then... ,[Screams into the wand, blowing a gargantuan, unshaped bubble],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Wow! ,[Squidward is then lifted off the ground. The bubble pops off the wand and Squidward falls back on the ground],
,SpongeBob:, All right, Squid. That was so good.
,Patrick:, Squid is number one.
,Squidward:, I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that.
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Squidward:, Now that's a bubble.
,SpongeBob:, You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique.
,Patrick:, Yeah, technique.
,Squidward:, Technique? Hah. SpongeBob, you don't think I created that ,[kisses his tentacle], beautiful work of art with your help? ,[he starts laughing], Come on, it's in my genes.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes! ,[Squidward walks back to his house],
,Squidward:, Thank you, thank you, thank you. ,[he starts to play his clarinet. SpongeBob and Patrick chant Squidward's name. At one point, they belly flop each other and Patrick falls on the ground.], I rock. ,[Squidward continues to play his clarinet. As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to chant, Squidward's bubble flies over them, covers Squidward's house, and pulls it out of the ground and up towards the top of the ocean. SpongeBob notices and stops Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, ,[concerned], Squidward! ,[Patrick now notices],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! ,[Squidward stops playing his clarinet],
,Squidward:, Hello, my friends. You are looking at a... ,[he sees how far he is from the surface],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ...genius. ,[the bubble explodes in the air and then the ground violently rumbles and shakes. SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Wow! ,[the ground stops shaking. The two slowly walk back to their homes. They then speed up and run inside their houses. Squidward's house floats back to the surface. He starts playing his clarinet weakly as the screen fades to black, ending the episode],

"[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down around SpongeBob's house and the bubble jar.],
,Patrick:, After you.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, thank you, Patrick. ,[dunks stick in a jar of bubbles, blows the bubble and it bursts],
,Patrick:, My turn. ,[dunks stick in a jar of bubbles, blows the bubble and it bursts],
,SpongeBob:, Neato. ,[the bubble pops as SpongeBob dunks the stick in a jar of bubbles], Watch this. ,[blows the bubble],
,Patrick:, ,[bored], Wow. ,[SpongeBob yawns as Patrick sleeps and snores as the bubble pops and he wakes up, shouts], Monosodium glutamate! ,[blows another bubble, then pops],
,SpongeBob:, You know, Patrick, ,[sniffs], we should spice up our bubble blowing.
,Patrick:, Yeah, yeah. Spice. ,[picks up the bubble jar, close-up of it], No spice. Hmm... ,[throws away the bubble jar and pulls out a jar of hot sauce from his pocket, close-up of it], Hot sauce! ,[opens the jar with his mouth while the inside of the jar mini-explodes, then places it down], Spicy bubbles. ,[SpongeBob giggles as Patrick dunks the stick in the hot sauce then blows a bubble, which it flies to SpongeBob's eyes and bursts, causing the eyes to sting,]
,SpongeBob:, Hmm... ,[screams as his eyes disappear, then pop back out, causing him to laugh, and then he blows a bubble and does the same thing to Patrick: screaming from the sting of the bubble],
,Patrick:, I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.
,Both:, Nah. ,[they laugh, then blow bubbles repeatedly toward their eyes that make them scream and then laugh],
,[meanwhile, at Squidward's house],
,Squidward:,  ,[cuts a leaf from his bonsai portrait of himself], ,[sighs], 20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this? ,[close-up of leaf under the portrait's nose], I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm... ,[tries to cut the leaf, but eventually, SpongeBob and Patrick keep screaming and laughing outside, causing the bonsai to rip off and land on Squidward's lap], ,[worried], Oh. Look what I've done. ,[cries], Oh, no!
,Bonsai Squidward:, ,[comes to life], Squidward.
,Squidward:, What? What? Who said that?
,Bonsai Squidward:, It's me, your bonsai Squidward. Will you grant me my final request?
,Squidward:, Of..of course. ,[puts the bonsai down], What...what...what is it?
,Bonsai Squidward:, Avenge me.
,Squidward:, ""Avenge me?"" ,[ominous music plays as Squidward gets angry and looks out the window, seeing SpongeBob and Patrick laughing], SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to blow bubbles in there eyes before they laugh again],
,Patrick:, I must have more.
,SpongeBob:, You want more? ,[inhales and blows a big spicy bubble],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, you moron, you ruined my bon… ,[notices the bubble], ...sai. ,[the spicy bubble explodes and burns Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Let's go to Sandy's.
,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick walking to Sandy's house where Sandy fixes an air tank connected to her treedome],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented.
,Patrick:, Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy
,SpongeBob:, Maybe even smarter.
,Sandy:, Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy.
,Patrick:, Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person? ,[breathes deeply a few times, then chuckles], Guess you're just too dumb.
,SpongeBob:, I know, Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you. ,[inhales, then starts blowing],
,Sandy:, That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines. ,[SpongeBob blows the bubbles onto the air tank which starts to burn],
,Sandy:, ,[gasps before seeing the water starting to flood Sandy's treedome],
,SpongeBob:, Oops.
,Sandy:, I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks.
,SpongeBob:, Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door. ,[opens the door, but the water comes in],
,Patrick:, Even I knew that was dumb.
,Sandy:, Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! ,[cuts to the submarine whirring and pinging up to the surface], How's Sandy doing back there?
,Patrick:, I'm not sure. Let me check. ,[an alarm beeps], Oh!
,Sandy:, Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules.
,Patrick:, She's totally losing it.
,Sandy:, ,[gasps and grunts, touching her face], Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face.
,Patrick:, Never mind. She seems fine.
,SpongeBob:, Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight.. ,[covers his face], ...horrible dehydrating sunlight. ,[shivers],
,Sandy:, Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut. ,[the sub screeches around as SpongeBob and Patrick both scream],
,SpongeBob:, Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.
,Sandy:, Ahh... ,[licks her helmet and smacks her lips], You taste like glass. ,[hiccups],
,SpongeBob:, ,[the submarine reaches the surface], Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.
,Patrick:, Get what over with?
,SpongeBob:, Where's Sandy
,Patrick:, I thought she was with you.
,SpongeBob:, Uh-oh. ,[the engine revs],
,Sandy:, Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty ,[the sub screeches downward as SpongeBob and Patrick both scream],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, what are you doing? Air is up there.
,Sandy:, Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, No! ,[the submarine crashes on the rooftop of the Krusty Krab before Sandy's gauge gets empty],
,Sandy:, Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore. ,[takes off her helmet, which the ocean water fills, before eating a Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, No Sandy, you need air, not food! ,[shoots the Krabby Patty out of Sandy's mouth with her tail],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! What's going on out here?
,SpongeBob:,  ,[as Sandy holds her breath in], Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. O,2, I believe. Good old atomic number eight.
,Sandy:, ,[moans angrily], 
,Patrick:, Uh--uh-- ,[his bones crack], Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.
,Mr. Krabs:, But how are you gonna get them down? 
,SpongeBob:, Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!
,SpongeBob:, ,[while connecting the straws together], Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back. 
,Patrick:, Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue. 
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I'm ready. 
,Patrick:, Just a little bit further. Okay, got it. 
,SpongeBob:, Hurry up, Patrick. ,[Patrick starts sucking bubbles with straws], 
,Sandy:, Hm-mmm. ,[Patrick holds a nut before Sandy sniffs it and punches Patrick], 
,Patrick:, Looks like her color's coming back. 
,SpongeBob:, That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air. 
,Squidward:, I said what? 
,Mr. Krabs:, So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell. ,[to Sandy], Go ahead. Don't be shy. ,[Sandy grunts and puts her head on Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob starts clicking Mr. Krabs' arm back and fourth], 
,Pearl:, Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof. Oh, you seem kind of busy. Maybe I should come back later. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops Pearl], No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right? 
,Pearl:, Yeah, I guess so. 
,SpongeBob:, And you breathe air, right? 
,Pearl:, Sure, my nose is full of it.
,SpongeBob:, You've got to help Sandy. She needs to share your air.
,Sandy:, ,[whimpers while being held by SpongeBob],
,Pearl:, I guess us mammals have to stick together.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little ,[places Sandy on Pearl's head], Okay, Pearl let 'er rip. ,[Pearl breaths and Sandy inflates], Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything. ,[they go outside to the back], I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air. ,[while tying a rope around his foot], When I tug on this rope, you pull me down.
,Patrick:, But how are you going to get up there?
,SpongeBob:, I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.
,Patrick:, An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.
,SpongeBob:, I know. Wish me luck, old friend. ,[uses a wrench and opens the oxygen tank],
,Patrick:, ,[salutes], SquarePants, I salute you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets to the surface before he gasps, then he opens the jar of bubble soap and pours it on his head], Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy. ,[inhales], So fresh it hurts. ,[squeaks and forms a huge air bubble], Okay, Patrick, pull me down. ,[tugs the rope with his leg], 
,Patrick:, Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghost! ,[screams before running away], 
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, here we go. ,[goes underwater], 
,Patrick:, Ah, ah! Oof! ,[starts rolling down the hill and rolls into Sandy's treedome with the big bubble], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[as Sandy wakes up], Welcome back, Sandy. 
,Sandy:, I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick both snicker],
,Sandy:, Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got us into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing anymore bubbles around my house.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Uh-oh. ,[Sandy's house begins floating in the giant bubble],

"Narrator:, Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps out of bed], Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note.
,Patrick:, ,[as note], SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Erikson Day! Yingin-hinga- dinga!
,SpongeBob:, Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me. ,[throws his costume away], Another note.
,Sandy:, ,[as note], SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy.
,SpongeBob:, I don't get it. The water's fine. ,[scene shows the treedome snowing inside], Hey, Squidward! Want to play?
,Squidward:, ,[as note], No.
,SpongeBob:, Are you sure?
,Squidward:, ,[as note], Yes.
,SpongeBob:, Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy! ,[lets go of the stick which falls to the ground], Nah... ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a pile of rocks], Rock Buddy! Nope... ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a sink], Sink Buddy! ""[Sink Buddy drips a little water]"" Almost... ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob again], I've got it! ,[dips his bubble wand into bubble soap and blows a human shape-like bubble], Bubble Buddy! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Bubble Buddy on the seesaw], This...is...great! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob going up to the Krusty Krab with his bubble], I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs. ,[SpongeBob walks in the Krusty Krab but his bubble just floats at the door], Don't be shy, come on! ,[SpongeBob squeezes the bubble through the doors],
,Squidward:, Please come again. When I'm not working. Next.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward!
,Squidward:, How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?
,SpongeBob:, I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!
,Squidward:, This bubble is your friend? ,[sees his reflection in Bubble Buddy's face; giggles], Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm not hungry.
,Squidward:, Well, thanks for stopping by.
,SpongeBob:, Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!
,Squidward:, Why would I do that?
,SpongeBob:, He's hungry.
,Squidward:, He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[comes out of the register], What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here. ,[a criminal is eating a Krabby Patty], At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.
,Squidward:, I'm not taking an order for a bubble.
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe. ,[goes back to the cash register, then he peeks at Squidward], Even if you quit. ,[goes back into the cash register again],
,Squidward:, May I take your order?
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you. ,[reads the menu], Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything. ,[Mr. Krabs explodes through the cash register],
,Mr. Krabs:, One of everything?! Whoopee! ,[rips off his shirt and applies a tattoo on himself that has a heart and the words ""Bubble Buddy"" through it], I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. ,[points his eyes to a table in the opposite direction],
,SpongeBob:, Bubble Buddy's thirsty.
,Squidward:, How about a glass of our finest shampoo? ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Sounds great! ,[Squidward looks annoyed that he took his comment literally, walks off and returns with a shampoo bottle with a straw in it],
,Squidward:, Here's your hair care product, sir.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws. ,[Squidward bends the straw], Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chews and spits a Krabby Patty for an old lady to eat], Think of the customer.
,Squidward:, ,[drinks shampoo], Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy.
,SpongeBob:, Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!
,Squidward:, And?
,SpongeBob:, Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?
,Squidward:, We? How about you take these patties and sh...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[off-screen; cutting him off], Mr. Squidward! ,[Squidward frowns in annoyance; he takes back the patty and walks off with the cart],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.
,Squidward:, What, is he allergic to bread, too?
,SpongeBob:, Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...
,Squidward:, Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style! ,[sets a bigger ferris wheel on the table], And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask.
,SpongeBob:, That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! ,[Mr. Krabs waves],
,Mr. Krabs:, So long, boys! You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab. ,[hands Mr. Krabs a $100 bill made of bubbles],
,Mr. Krabs:, What's this?
,Squidward:, Bubble money. ,[$100 bill pops. Squidward shows his hand full of bubble change], At least they left a tip! ,[all the bubbles pop as Mr. Krabs and Squidward start growling with fury. Scene cuts to Goo Lagoon],
,SpongeBob:, Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. ,[Scooter runs up to SpongeBob],
,Scooter:, Dudes, bury me! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, See what I mean? ,[fade cut], All done!
,Scooter:, ,[buried under the sand], All right!
,SpongeBob:, Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy.
,Scooter:, Don't just stand there, dude. The tide's coming in. ,[laughs. Water reaches him], Dude?
,SpongeBob:, ,[places Bubble Buddy inside], My friend's in there.
,Harold:, Congratulations.
,SpongeBob:, ,[goes to the music and he dances along], Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! ,[everyone looks at their rears and they leave in embarrassment],
,Pearl:, It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper!
,Grubby Grouper:, Later, groupies! ,[shakes Pearl's hand], Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo!
,Pearl:, ,[looks at her fin which is dirty now], Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again. ,[SpongeBob walks up with Bubble Buddy],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy! ,[rubs Bubble Buddy's hands on Pearl's dirty flipper, her flipper is now clean. Pearl sobs. Scene cuts to the port-o-potty], It's his first time on his own.
,Harold:, Once again, congratulations. ,[later, the line is longer. Picture scrolls over to where we see a sign that reads '45 minutes from this point'],
,Man:, Popcorn! Peanuts!
,Lou:, ,[sounding desperate], Ice cold drinks!
,Harold:, ,[camera stops on Harold and SpongeBob as SpongeBob whistles and Peterson struggles to hold it in. Unable to take the wait anymore], Two hours is long enough! That's it! ,[opens the port-o-potty door to see Bubble Buddy],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished! ,[takes Bubble Buddy away, leaving everybody to glare at them],
,Francis:, He kept us waiting for a bubble?
,Larry:, That's nothing! He called us fat!,[along with others, he begins crunching on celery stalk],
,Pearl:, ,[crying as she shows her clean flipper], He washed my flipper!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[storming up], He owes me money!
,Squidward:, ,[following Mr. Krabs], He made me provide excellent service!
,Scooter:, ,[appears with a halo and angel clothing on], Dudes! He made me experience high tide! ,[floats up towards the surface while laughing],
,Tom:, He poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses!
,Protesters:, He did?
,Tom:, No... But are we gonna wait around until he does?
,Mr. Krabs:, I say we tip something over! ,[all yelling],
,Lifeguard:, Hey, hey, hey! ,[everyone tips the lifeguard stand],
,Protester:, Now what?
,Protesters:, Get the lifeguard! ,[they go to the lifeguard, but Squidward stops them],
,Squidward:, Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems! ,[holds up a needle], Who's with me?
,Protesters:, ,[all hold a needle], Pop the bubble! ,[all yelling],
,SpongeBob:, ,[everybody surrounds them], Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?
,Protesters:, Yes...
,SpongeBob:, Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?
,Protesters:, No... ,[group steps in closer],
,SpongeBob:, Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.
,Larry:, SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go.
,SpongeBob:, Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern.
,Pearl:, No. ""Go"" as in... ,[blows a bubble gum until it pops],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Why?!
,Mr. Krabs:, You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!
,SpongeBob:, No! I won't let you! ,[blows Bubble Buddy until they begin floating], Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never! ,[both start to get lower to the ground and the group surrounds them both again], Never...
,Squidward:, Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!
,Protesters:, Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble!
,SpongeBob:, No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[starts crying], Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you!
,Sheldon:, Funny Muffler...
,Larry:, Jerky Pal...
,Harold:, Boo-boo Keys...
,Man:, Snake Eyes... ,[together with Harold], We love you! ,[burst into tears],
,SpongeBob:, So, what do you say?
,Protesters:, ,[look at each other, then they bring out their needles], Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! ,[throw SpongeBob away],
,Squidward:, Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet!
,SpongeBob:, Noo... ,[Squidward charges his needle towards Bubble Buddy in a slow dramatic manner, while SpongeBob begs them to stop. But then suddenly Bubble Buddy grabs ahold of Squidward's hand before the needle reaches the former],
,Bubble Buddy:, Whoa! ,[all except SpongeBob gasp], Hey, don't I get a say in this? I'll see you later, SpongeBob. Things are getting a little weird around here.
,SpongeBob:, So long. ,[Bubble Buddy gets into a bubble taxi and it floats away as it drives off],
,Bubble Buddy:, Happy Leif Ericcson Day!
,Squidward:, He's alive?
,SpongeBob:, Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes! ,[laughs as everyone walks off muttering and agreeing with Bubble Buddy's departure], Seems like only this morning I held his bottle. ,[sniffles], They blow up so fast. ,[weeps tears of joy while blowing his nose and runs off. A bunch of bubbles pop near Squidward except for one],
,Squidward:, ,[thinking bubble is alive like Bubble Buddy], Uh...hi?

"[The scene shows the Chum Bucket. Inside SpongeBob, Plankton, and Karen are in line doing the conga and laughing in a party-looking setting.],
,Plankton:, More fruit punch, SpongeBob?
,[Karen gets SpongeBob a glass of fruit punch.],
,SpongeBob:, You know Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!
,[SpongeBob drinks the fruit punch.],
,Plankton:, Oh I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!
,[SpongeBob looks at the copier.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?
,Plankton:, Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough.
,SpongeBob:, How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?
,Plankton:, Just lay face-down and keep still. ,[clicks ""SCAN""],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Laughs],
,Plankton:, Alright. Party's over. Go home!
,SpongeBob:, Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch.
,Plankton:, No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow.
,SpongeBob:, Nah! I feel fine!
,Plankton:, Are you sure?
,SpongeBob:, Now that you ask, I don't know. ,[feels a twinge], I think I just felt a twinge!
,Plankton:, You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off. ,[Slams the door. The scene returns to the copier. Plankton clicks ""PRINT."" A copy of SpongeBob is printed from the copier. Plankton squirts a drop of toner. The SpongeBob copy comes to life.], Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say ""Secret formula""?
,SpongeBob Copy:, Se.. Se... for mama.
,Plankton:,  ""Se-cret Form-ula""
,SpongeBob Copy:,  Se-cret Form-ula. Secret formula!
,[The SpongeBob copy and Plankton both laugh evilly. Scene cuts to Plankton making a tie for CopyBob],
,Plankton:, Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula.
,SpongeBob Copy:, My name is SpongeBob SquarePants and I want the secret formula.
,Plankton:, Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait! ,[He colors the white tie with a blue marker.], Just keeping track of my copy.
,[The copy walks into the Krusty Krab humming. The real SpongeBob is humming the same tune, but gets stopped by Plankton.],
,Plankton:, What are you doing here?! You said you would take today off.
,SpongeBob:, But I feel great today.
,Plankton:, Are you sure? Because you're sweating. ,[Scene shows SpongeBob in a pot of fire. SpongeBob walks away but Plankton bursts over.],
,Plankton:, But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Laughs], Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color. ,[Goes into Krusty Krab. Scene shows the copy putting on a Krusty Krab hat.],
,SpongeBob Copy:, Morning.
,Squidward:, Whatever. ,[The real SpongeBob comes doing the same thing],
,SpongeBob:, Morning.
,Squidward:, I said ""Whatever."" ,[Shocked], Wait, didn't I just... didn't I...,[Looks behind the window as there is two SpongeBobs.],
,Both SpongeBobs:, Ooh. ,[Both laugh],
,Squidward:, There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare! ,[Starts beating himself up.], Wake up! (x3) ,[A short customer enters],
,Short customer:, I'd like to place an order for two.
,Squidward:, Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!
,Short customer:, That's me: The man of your dreams. ,[Walks away],
,Squidward:, If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything! ,[He pushes a cup of soda off the cash register but it's floating in the air.], I really am dreaming! ,[Scene shows a kid with a propeller hat making the cup fly. Scene cuts to the SpongeBobs.],
,SpongeBob:, What's your name, handsome stranger?
,SpongeBob Copy:, My name is SpongeBob SquarePants.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Surprised], Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common! ,[Both laugh], I always wanted a twin brother! ,[Turns into a bubble shape of himself], How do you feel about bubbles?
,SpongeBob Copy:, I love them! ,[The real SpongeBob turns into a jellyfish],
,SpongeBob:, Jelly fishing?
,SpongeBob Copy:, The same thing you do. ,[The real SpongeBob turns his face into the form of Squidward's face.],
,SpongeBob:, How about Squidward?
,SpongeBob Copy:, Oh please. ,[Both laugh],
,SpongeBob:, I think I'll nickname you... Me two! ,[Both laugh again. Plankton goes into SpongeBob Copy's ear.],
,Plankton:, Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya. ,[Whispers], Have you learned the secret formula yet?
,Me Two:, Oh, I can't tell you that. It's a secret. By the way, my name is Me Two.
,Plankton:, Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula. ,[Me Two launches Plankton into Mr. Krabs' office.], Time to adjust my plan. ,[Mr. Krabs appears.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two.
,Both SpongeBobs:, You are too good to us, Mr. Krabs. ,[Bubble transitions to Chum Bucket and comes to the copier],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?
,Karen:, How could I forget? ,[Scene shows a tattoo of Plankton on Karen's hard drive], You had it tattooed on my hard drive.
,Plankton:, Now where was I? Oh yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA. ,[Clicks ""Print"" again. Another sponge appears. Plankton squirts another drop of toner and the sponge comes alive. Plankton laughs.],
,SpongeBob Copy:, Ooh. ,[Eats Plankton],
,Karen:, No, no, SpongeCopy. We don't put dirty, nasty things in our mouth. Spit it out. ,[The copy spits Plankton out.],]
,Plankton:, Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs ,[whispering], and ask him for the secret formula.
,SpongeBob Copy:, Mr. Krabs, secret formula. Got it.
,Plankton:, And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!
,SpongeBob Copy:, Got it! ,[Eats Plankton again],
,Karen:, Ah! Ah! SpongeCopy! ,[Spits Plankton on the floor],
,Plankton:, You see, this is why I never had children.
,[Scene transitions to Squidward looking at the SpongeBobs. One is eating ketchup and the other is juggling Krabby Patties.],
,Squidward:, Yup. I'm still dreaming. ,[To a customer], Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream? ,[Slams his patty on the ground], I heard you like your patties ""Ground""! ,[Laughs and goes over to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Mr. Squidward! Just what the devilfish do you think your doing?!
,Squidward:, Isn't it obvious, you red-faced tightwad? I'm dreaming! ,[Pulls down Mr. Krabs' pants], What's that under there?
,Mr. Krabs:, Under where?
,Squidward:, That's right. ,[Kicks Mr. Krabs into his office], ♪I don't care, I don't care, none of this is real.♪ Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly! ,[Copy enters Krusty Krab and goes into Mr. Krabs's office.],

,Mr. Krabs:, You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy.
,SpongeBob Copy:, Secret formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy! ,[Plankton is looking at them],
,Plankton:,  He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, no! No!
,SpongeBob Copy:, Secret formula. Secret formula. Secret formu...
,SpongeBob:, Hey, look. Another handsome devil. ,[laughs], We'll call you Me Three ,[laughs again], Aww. Let's go flip some patties.
,Plankton:, Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs. ,[Scene bubble transitions to Plankton playing a snare drum as a million copies of SpongeBob walk out of the Chum Bucket.], March! March my pretties and learn the formula!
,SpongeBob Copies:, Secret Formula. Secret Formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only gonna tell you the secret formula one more time!
,SpongeBob copies:,  One more time!
,Mr. Krabs:, So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks.
,SpongeBob copies:, Yay! Hooray!
,Plankton:, They all know the formula!
,One SpongeBob Copy:, Let me do that!
,SpongeBob:, OK. Thanks.
,[SpongeBob walks towards the mop, another copy pops out of the bucket.],
,Another SpongeBob Copy:, Let me do that
,SpongeBob:, Sure.
,Another SpongeBob copy:, I'll polish the pickles
,SpongeBob:,  ,[To Me Two], Looks like you sponges have everything covered.
,Me Two:,  Mm hmm. ,[Turns into light gray hue],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?
,Me Two:, I came from the Chum Bucket.
,SpongeBob:, The Chum Bucket?
,Plankton:, ♪I'm going to know the formula! I'm going to know the formula...♪
,SpongeBob:, Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula.
,Plankton:, Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!
,Me Two:, Uhh...
,SpongeBob:, You got to help him! I think he's sick or something.
,Me Two:, I feel funny. ,[Vanishes],
,SpongeBob:, Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!
,Plankton:, I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner.
,SpongeBob:, What does that mean?
,Plankton:, It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!
,SpongeBob:, Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't! ,[Talking to Me Three], No! Don't disappear! ,[He disappears right after he says that. He cries.],
,Plankton:, Quickly man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!
,SpongeBob Copy:, It's easy. You take one par... I don't feel so good [,Disappears,]
,Plankton:, Wait, no! ,[Each time he goes near a copy, he says The formula but then each copy disappears. Scene cuts to a bunch of other copies cleaning the roof, mowing the lawn, and some other things but they disappear. Then the scene cuts to Patrick playing with some of the copies but they disappear also.],
,Patrick:, Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube... ,[Stopped because he gets hit by a lawnmower and gets split into 9 mini copies of himself. Scene transitions to Plankton running over to the final copy.],
,Plankton:, What's the formula?! ,[Mr. Krabs enters.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here.
,[The copy vanishes],
,Plankton:, Geez, What a cheapskate. I can't believe I failed again!
,SpongeBob:, I can believe it.
,Plankton:, Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!
,SpongeBob:, Well, you see, it's... nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. The original sponge. ,[Grins], I can't believe they're all gone.
,Plankton:, You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, those imitations were my friends.
,Plankton:, One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around.
,Plankton:, Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want.
,SpongeBob:, Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip ,[He skips off-screen, laughing],
,Plankton:, Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!
,Squidward:, Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!
,Plankton:, Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three. two... ,[Gets crushed by Squidward], OW! Right on my keys!

,[Squidward tries to grab something to make him see again, but instead picks up the hot sauce and squirts it in his eye. This causes his eye to catch fire.],
,Squidward:, ,[screams],
,Mr. Krabs:, I smell something burning.
,Squidward:, Yeah. Probably my eye.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, stop your drama, Squidward.
,[Mr. Krabs blows the extinguisher in his face.],
,Squidward:, You missed a spot.
,[Mr. Krabs flashes it in his face three times. He walks into the kitchen and sees what SpongeBob is doing. He then blows the extinguisher on Herb, Loretta, Timmy, and Sally.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally.
,Mr. Krabs:, Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.
,SpongeBob:, Like what, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!
,SpongeBob:, At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.
,Mr. Krabs:, Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I could try. ,[scoops off the burnt patties and puts a new one on], Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!
,[Pete droops a bit.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!
,SpongeBob:, Maybe Pete is just tired.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs. ,[sprays ketchup on the productivity chart], I guess it might affect his productivity-
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], No! Not his productivity!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!
,SpongeBob:, Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!
,Mr. Krabs:, Company picnic?
,[Pete comes back up.],
,SpongeBob:, See, look! He's already perking up!
,Mr. Krabs:, Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?
,SpongeBob:, Definitely!
,Squidward:, ,[opens door], What's going on in here?
,Mr. Krabs:,  Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!
,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob high-five each other and then the screen moves to the window and shows an eye that then goes back to The Chum Bucket.],
,Plankton:, A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.
,[The scene changes to Jellyfish Fields and shows SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward sitting on toilet paper.],
,Squidward:, This is the greatest company picnic ever?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, yes it is.
,SpongeBob:, Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started.
,Squidward:, Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.
,[SpongeBob puts on a hat made out of toilet paper.],
,SpongeBob:, Here's one!
,Squidward:, Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Right you are! Here's the food! ,[points to a pile of condiment packs.],
,Squidward:, ,[picks up packet of mustard], What?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack. ,[bites a pack of mustard and opens it with his mouth.], See? You open it with your teeth. ,[puts mustard on a round piece of toilet paper.], There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.
,[Squidward holds the disk-shaped paper.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Going long!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ho, ho. This is so much fun.
,[SpongeBob runs out far.],
,SpongeBob:, Is this far enough?
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!
,[Mr. Krabs throws disk-shaped paper but ends up flying in Squidward's face, covering him with mustard.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looks out], Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.
,[The disk-shaped paper with mustard slides off of Squidward's face.],
,Squidward:, I'm going home.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs Squidward], Oh no you're not. ,[sets him down], You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!
,Squidward:, ,[grumbles],
,[SpongeBob comes back and sees Squidward's face smeared with mustard.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs. ,[licks some mustard from Squidward's face], Ahh. Here, let me try!
,[SpongeBob grabs a pack of ketchup and opens it with his teeth. He turns around and does his make-over with the ketchup. He turns around again with the face of Barnacle Boy.],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy.
,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, ""This was the greatest...""
,Squidward:, Do not say it!
,Mr. Krabs:, ""The greatest comp...""
,Squidward:, Don't!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[a rainbow appears], ""The greatest company picnic ever!""
,[Suddenly, they hear loud music and a van is driving up towards them.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, looks like we've got company.
,SpongeBob:, Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic. ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs nervously], I have? Wait. Oh yeah.
,[The van drives past them and backs up.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[reads the license plate on the van], ""Chumpany Picnic""? That's not how you spell ""Company Picnic""!
,Plankton:, ,[honks the horn], Guess who?
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton!
,[Plankton hops out of the van.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?
,Plankton:, Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!
,Plankton:, Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.
,SpongeBob:, ,[happy], Aww!
,Mr. Krabs:, You don't even have any employees!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sad], Aww!
,Plankton:, Sure I do.
,[Two robots that resemble SpongeBob and Squidward pop out of the van.],
,Plankton:, Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.
,[Simmy throws the disk at Tally, but bounces back. They do it two times.],
,SpongeBob:, A real disk?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!
,SpongeBob:, Well. Eh.
,Plankton:, You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.
,SpongeBob:, Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic.
,[Squidward is wrapped up in toilet paper and is being chased by jellyfish. Simmy and Tally placed a huge trunk in the middle of the ground.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?
,Plankton:, Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.
,[As Plankton talks, Simmy and Tally set up numerous things people see at a carnival.],
,Plankton:, The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...
,Squidward:, Delicacies?
,Plankton:, And of course, the dunking booth!
,[Tally throws the ball and Simmy gets dunked in the dunking booth. Simmy short-circuits and explodes. Plankton becomes worried.],
,Plankton:, ,[turns SpongeBob around], Have you seen the calliope?
,[Tally plays the calliope.],
,SpongeBob:, Aww!
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...
,Squidward:, One side, Goopy!
,[Squidward runs past Mr. Krabs, which makes him spin around until his shell falls off. Seeing that he is naked, Mr. Krabs is embarrassed. Squidward gobbles up the cotton candy and roasted peanuts in a crazy frenzy.],
,SpongeBob:, Yum.
,[Mr. Krabs struggles to get his shell back on.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Is this backwards? ,[grunts], Oh, that's not it either.
,Plankton:, You were saying, Krabs? ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[angry], Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs.
,[Mr. Krabs manages to get his shell back on.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?
,[SpongeBob zips Mr. Krabs' shell and they both leave. They sit back down to their picnic area. Then they see Squidward having fun on the world's most exciting roller coaster.],
,SpongeBob:, Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.
,Squidward:, ,[offscreen], Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up some condiments], You want me to paint your face?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I don't know.
,[SpongeBob sprays mayonnaise on Mr. Krabs' face.],
,SpongeBob:, Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost.
,[SpongeBob makes a beard out of the mayonnaise on Mr. Krabs' face. However, the mayonnaise smelled terrible.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffs], Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.
,SpongeBob:, ,[eerily], Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah. ,[laughs nervously],
,[Tally holds a huge amount of cotton candy over Simmy.],
,Simmy:, Whoa! Stop! That is almost too much cotton candy!
,[Tally drops the cotton candy on Simmy. Simmy short-circuits and explodes. Mr. Krabs wipes the mayonnaise off his face.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?
,SpongeBob:, No. Course not.
,Mr. Krabs:, Are you sure you don't want to?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!
,Mr. Krabs:, You sure?
,SpongeBob:, 100% sure, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!
,[Mr. Krabs runs back to Plankton's company picnic and plays the games of chance wheel. As the wheel spins, his eyes spin. The wheel stops and Mr. Krabs wins a stuffed walrus from Tally. Then he played the game of knocking the bottles with the ball and wins a second stuffed walrus from Tally.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], You can never have too many!
,Squidward:, Whoo!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, Squiddie-bird!
,[Squidward jumps off the roller coaster and runs with Mr. Krabs.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! ,[picks up the mustard plate but drops it], Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs are having the time of their lives at Plankton's company picnic.],
,SpongeBob:, It's a paper plate. Whoo! ,[throws plate and drops it],
,[SpongeBob hears Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton laughing together as they are having a fun time. SpongeBob thinks for a bit and realizes that the Krusty Krab company picnic isn't as fun as it seemed.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me.
,[SpongeBob decides to go and join the fun. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are laughing together.],
,Squidward:, I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...
,Plankton:, Say no more, my friend. ,[holds out contract], If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh! ,[grabs the pen and contract], Me first! Me first!
,Plankton:, Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's such great advice!
,[Squidward sucks on the pen.],
,Plankton:, This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more! ,[laughs evilly],
,[An angry SpongeBob appears next to Plankton, meaning that he heard everything Plankton said.],
,SpongeBob:, Ahem! Hello, Plankton!
,Plankton:, Uh oh.
,[SpongeBob sees Mr. Krabs, who is about to sign Plankton's contract.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!
,[SpongeBob pounces on Mr. Krabs and prevents him from signing the contract. However, his actions sends the pen flying.],
,Mr. Krabs:, My candied pen!
,[The pen is hurling towards Simmy. SpongeBob, in slow motion, runs to Simmy.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in slow motion], Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!
,[The pen is about to hit Simmy.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in slow motion], No!
,[However, instead of hitting Simmy, it went through the robot. The pen lands on the ground and rolls to a projector. SpongeBob bangs on the projector, revealing that Simmy and Tally was just a trash can and a ball wash post.],
,SpongeBob:, Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...
,[The projector reveals that the world's most exciting roller coaster was actually a rotting corpse of a sea monster.],
,Squidward:, I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?
,[The projector reveals that the food Squidward ate was just rotten chum. The projector also revealed that the pen he was sucking on was a caterpillar. Squidward freaks out and rubs his tongue in disgust. The projector reveals that the van Plankton drove on was an old broken down van. Mr. Krabs gasps in wonder what the stuffed walruses were. But nothing happens.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whew! That was a cl...
,[The projector reveals that the stuffed walruses were actually fish skeletons. Mr. Krabs screams in terror and the skeletons crumble to dust.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You saved me, boy. How did you do it?
,SpongeBob:, I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs.
,[Plankton walks up to them.],
,Plankton:, Unbelievable!
,[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton.],
,Plankton:, Uh oh.
,[Mr. Krabs puts Plankton on the disk-shaped paper with mustard and throws him out in the distance. Once it landed, there was an explosion.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps up as a rainbow appears and jellyfish fly around], The greatest company picnic ever!
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work! ,[laughs as he leaves],
,[The episode ends with SpongeBob still being in the air and an angry Squidward gets stung in the head by a jellyfish.],

,Man:, Why don't you watch where you're going?!
,Suzy Fish:, Get back here!
,Old Man Jenkins:, I'll sue!

,SpongeBob:, ,[About to eat cereal, when the bubble goes into his mouth. He takes it, and the note, out], Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him. ,[opens letter], Let's see: Dear, SpongeBob...

,Bubble Buddy:, The Mrs. and I have to go away for a few days, and our regular bubble sitter is sick. Could you please watch our son, Shiny, until we get back? I owe you one! Your pal, Bubble Buddy.

,SpongeBob:, Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond. ,[Done reading], Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say. ,[Bubble morphs into Shiny], Oh, I can't wait to meet him! ,[Shiny touches SpongeBob, scaring him], Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens! ,[picks him up], Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary. ,[Shiny blinks, and Gary hides in his shell], You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!
,Squidward:, ,[Exits his house, and SpongeBob does the same, with Shiny on his head],
,SpongeBob:, ♪La la la la la la la!♪ This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends.

We'll have to try again, later. ,[Shiny floats away], Hey, Shiny. Where are you going? ,[Shiny floats into the window], You can't go in there! You weren't invited!

,Squidward:, Would you please get your friend out of my house?

,Squidward:, Where is he?

Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him! ,[opens several cupboards with the following items], Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha! ,[opens the cupboard and immediately reaches inside, jabbing himself with broken glass], No, guess not. ,[gasps], You don't think he p-p-popped in there?

,Squidward:, Of course.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now. ,[tries to catch Shiny, but he misses], Barnacles!

,SpongeBob:, Shiny, come back! ,[he and Squidward run upstairs], There he is! ,[Shiny begins to float out a window], He's headed for that open window! ,[the wind blows Shiny back in. Shiny grabs a paintbrush, and paints a mustache on one of Squidward's paintings],
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs Shiny], I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off. ,[uses Shiny to wipe the mustache off], There you go, good as new. ,[the painting of Squidward drips off the painting, revealing its brain, making Squidward angry], Really catches your inner self.

,Mr. Krabs:, Come here you little rascal! ,[tries to grab him. SpongeBob takes Shiny away],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?
,[SpongeBob takes Shiny in the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill. ,[puts Shiny on the dishes], You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry.

,SpongeBob:, Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer.

,Customer:, Money! Yay!

Safe and sound. ,[gets hit by a boat], Now, Shiny, I- ,[gets run over by another boat], Now, Shiny, you might- ,[gets run over by several more boats], That was a close one. Okay, now.

He comes out with pins stuck in him, and Shiny], You need to watch where you're going. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose. ,[pulls the pin from his nose, and deflates. He blows himself back up],
,[Shiny floats away],
,SpongeBob:, Where's Shiny? Oh, no! ,[Shiny floats into the Bikini Bottom Scissor Works], ""Scissor Works""? I'll save you, Shiny! ,[goes inside. Clipping noises are heard. SpongeBob comes out with Shiny], Oh, boy. Don't you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed! ,[becomes reduced to cubes. He puts himself back together],

Ow. ,[walks out with Shiny and a pitchfork stuck in his head], Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Let's see if there's someplace for safe you to visit. Ah, that's it. ""The Pillow Foundry."" You'll like it in there. Pillows aren't dangerous. ,[goes inside and becomes surprised], Huh?
,[a stock footage of a live-action factory is shown. Iron is shown being melted, steamed, and comes out on a conveyor belt. It is cut by a buzzsaw, and a guy uses a giant needle to jab the pillows and fling them into a pile],

,SpongeBob:, Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm. ,[takes out bubble soap], I know! ,[blows a hot dog-shaped bubble, which bumps into Shiny, and pops. Shiny pops, too],
,SpongeBob:, ,[panicking], Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you! ,[dips bubble wand into the soap puddle. He blows a monster-shaped bubble], Oh, that ain't right! ,[blows a dinosaur-shaped bubble], Oh, come on, now! ,[blows Shiny back to normal], Phew, he's okay.
,[Shiny grows a second head],
,SpongeBob:, Uh-oh.
,Bubble Buddy:, Hey, SpongeBob. How's my son been faring?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he's... ,[hides Shiny behind his back], ...doing great.
,Bubble Buddy:, I see you've grown a second head, again, son.
,SpongeBob:, Again?
,Bubble Buddy:, Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll take care of it. ,[sucks Shiny into his bubble wand, and place him inside his soap bottle], So, did my son behave himself?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil sort of way.
,Bubble Buddy:, Well, see you later.
,[Shiny's head pops out of the bottle and raspberries SpongeBob before Bubble Buddy hops into an airplane-shaped bubble, which takes off],
,SpongeBob:, Bye, bye. Anytime you need a baby-sitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy.

,Squidward:, Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[gasp], Story time!
,SpongeBob:, Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave. ,[happy gland sneezes],
,Squidward:, And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--

,Squidward:, It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence. ,[turns it on], Now, they'll never get back in. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick land inside the fence area.],
,Patrick:, Let's do it again.
,SpongeBob:, Let's do it again.
,Patrick:, Can we, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Huh? What? No! Get out!
,SpongeBob:, But--
,Squidward:, No! You're going out this door, right now-- ,[touches the doorknob and gets electrocuted],
,SpongeBob:, You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? ,[Squidward's brain is not storming anymore and has a rainbow over it.], Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us.
,Squidward:, Do they have cute sea horses there?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, they're pretty adorable.
,Squidward:, And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah.
,Squidward:, Can I come?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[gasp], Ooooh—yeah. ,[cut to a montage of events: Squidward is petting a sea horse, riding in a wagon while SpongeBob and Patrick pull him, riding a Ferris wheel and taking pictures in a photo booth. Later, the bus drops them off in front of Squidward's house. Squidward runs inside], Good night, Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?
,Patrick:, Uh, new glasses?
,SpongeBob:, No, no. I mean he seems happier.
,Squidward:, ,[calling from his bedroom window], Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you! ,[closes the window],
,Patrick:, He's probably happy about his new glasses.
,[cut to exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple at sunrise. The rooster crows, light slowly fills SpongeBob's room, and then his foghorn alarm sounds. SpongeBob wakes up. He goes to turn off his alarm, but he pokes Squidward's nose instead.],
,Squidward:, Good morning, SpongeBob. ,[as the alarm goes off again], Honk!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, what are you doing here?
,Squidward:, You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward. ,[gets out of bed], I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly. ,[SpongeBob reads the newspaper while sipping his coffee cup.], The new Squidward sure is helpful. ,[SpongeBob finishes brushing his teeth, but is surprised when Squidward starts flossing them for him], Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward leave for work together], Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy. ,[wanting a little personal space, he moves to the right side of the driveway, but Squidward does too; cut to the Krusty Krab], Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us. ,[Squidward squeezes between them.],
,Squidward:, Hello, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?
,Squidward:, I wanted to help you work.
,SpongeBob:, What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh-- ,[pokes his head out the order window], --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! ,[grabs him and brings him out front], Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!
,Squidward:, How are we today? Everything a-okay here?
,Tom:, What do you mean?
,Squidward:, How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke. ,[puts a Krusty Krab hat on the kid],
,Little Kid Fish:, ,[holds Mable], Mommy, I'm scared.
,Squidward:, Who wants a free refill?
,Mr. Krabs:, Did someone just say ""free""? ,[runs out of his office], What's the problem here?
,Little Kid Fish:, He- he-- he asked me if I wanted tartar sauce, ,[she shows Mr. Krabs the Krusty Krab hat Squidward gave her], and then he gave me a free hat!
,Mr. Krabs:, Free?! ,[eyes dry up], Mr. Squidward!
,Squidward:, Yes, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob comes out of the bathroom and sees Squidward holding a plate of patties.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it. ,[He is about to throw the patties away until Mr. Krabs comes in.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them.
,Mr. Krabs:, They look okay to me.
,SpongeBob:, But he's not a real fry cook.
,Mr. Krabs:, He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you. ,[SpongeBob whimpers and his eyes get so small they fall out. Cut to later where both SpongeBob and Squidward are at the grill.],
,Squidward:, Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month.
,SpongeBob:, Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, What's the meaning of this?
,SpongeBob:, What's wrong with it?
,Mr. Krabs:, A smiley face with dimples? ,[Mr. Krabs shows a patty with a smiley face and dimples.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Dimples? It was him! No, Squidward did it. ,[smiles smugly, expecting Mr. Krabs to be upset at Squidward],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Yes, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do! ,[SpongeBob's eyes and mouth open wide and he freezes], You're the new Employee of the Month. ,[takes his picture. Shocked, SpongeBob breaks into pieces.],
,Patrick:, ,[walks into The Krusty Krab with a pink box in his hand], Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know. ,[SpongeBob doesn't say move.], No, really. who is it? I don't know.
,SpongeBob:, The guy you're looking for is over there. ,[points to a crowd of customers and Mr. Krabs throwing Squidward up into the air with excitement, then starts crying softly],
,Patrick:, Oh. SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes?
,Patrick:, I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--
,SpongeBob:, Mm-hmm?
,Patrick:, Help me spell 'Squidward'. ,[opens up the pink box to reveal a cake that reads ""Congratulations SpongeBob: Employee of the Month""],
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[changes ""SpongeBob"" to ""Squidward""],
,Patrick:, Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house! ,[cut to Patrick's house where they have the party and a banner reading ""Squidward Rocks"" is put up and everyone, including Squidward is in a conga line. SpongeBob, however, chooses to sit at a table by himself and stare at his piece of cake],
,Squidward:, Enjoying the party, SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob sniffles], How's the cake, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, It's okay, Squidward. ,[sniffles], It's a very okay cake. ,[sniffles],
,Squidward:, I love being Employee of the Month.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you? ,[sniffles yet again], Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend? ,[gasps loudly as his eyes get exaggeratedly wide and bloodshot], Pogo-dancing with your best friend?! ,[Patrick and Squidward are bouncing on pogo sticks. SpongeBob whimpers then gets angry], Stop! ,[the party stops], Maybe you can take my job! And maybe you can take my place on the employee of the month wall of fame! But nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guy,[points to Patrick], but me! ""he confiscates Squidward's pogo stick]"" Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub! ,[Squidward tearfully leaves and goes over to touch the doorknob on the electric fence, which is still on, and gets electrocuted, causing the power in Patrick's rock to go out for a second. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are on pogo sticks], You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world ,[gasps], I know. I'll go apologize. Come on. ,[goes over to Squidward, still being electrocuted], Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there.
,Patrick:, He's too proud.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal. ,[grabs Squidward's hand and gets electrocuted, too],
,Patrick:, Hey, I want to dance funny, too! ,[gets electrocuted, too. The OFF/ON switch explodes and the electric fence is no more.],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?
,[the electric fence has turned SpongeBob and Patrick mean, like Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, ,[nasal voice], What are you talking about?
,Patrick:, ,[nasal voice], Yeah, what's the big idea? ,[SpongeBob and Squidward start bickering simultaneously], I don't need this aggravation! ,Why, are you still standing here?!

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward are cleaning Mr. Krabs' office.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[being used as a scrub brush to clean the window], Ooh—,[gasps], Ooh—,[gasps], Yeah! Don't you just love cleaning day?
,Squidward:, ,[wrings SpongeBob in the mop bucket], We're so lucky.
,SpongeBob:, Aww. Mr. Krabs' first dollar. ,[sprays the picture frame, pulls his face off and scrubs it clean before putting it back on; however, the dollar is reduced to two quarters], Whaa? ,[he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his head; this time, it reduced into a penny], Huh? ,[he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his back; this time, the picture frame is completely blank; SpongeBob takes out a dollar, licks it and pastes it onto the picture frame],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't forget to clean the safe, boys. And keep your eyes on the Krabby Patty secret formula! ,[leaves],
,Squidward:, Hey, we need the combination!
,SpongeBob:, I got it covered. ,[turns the lock, goes to open it, but breaks his arm],
,Squidward:, Nyah!
,SpongeBob:, ,[hums as he pulls a piece of rolled-up paper from his broken arm], Doink! ,[snaps his arm back in place and chuckles as he reads the paper before turning the lock], Mm. Mm-hmm. ,[opens the safe], Voilà!
,Squidward:, ,[garbage falls out from the safe], Ahh—ooh! ,[pops out from the garbage],
,SpongeBob:, See? This is fun!
,[Meanwhile, outside the Krusty Krab, Plankton is once again devising his latest scheme to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs and holds out a strange helmet], Krabs will never see me coming! Presso-inviso! ,[pushes the button on the helmet and his body turns invisible; he hums as he walks to the restaurant, but trips over], Ahh! Can't see my own feet.
,[Back in the restaurant, SpongeBob is taking care of the secret formula like he's caring an infant.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[wraps a diaper around the bottle], Mm-hmm. ,[hums as puts the formula on a blanket and gives it a teddy bear and a baby bottle; then he wraps it with the blanket],Don't you go anywhere while I clean your homey-womey.
,[As SpongeBob dusts the safe, Squidward dumps trash in the trashcan with the secret formula still inside. He then goes to dump it out through the window.],
,Squidward:, Out of sight...,[Plankton laughs as he goes to the window], Out of my mind. ,[dumps the garbage on Plankton],
,Plankton:, ,[pops out from the garbage], Hey, watch it! ,[he sees the formula next to him and blubbers in surprise], Hommina—wah? The secret formula! Must be one of Krabs' tricks! ,[grabs the formula and makes a run for it], He'll pop out any second now. ,[stops in front of the Chum Bucket], Well? ,[silence], Nothing. All right. ,[turns around and heads back in the Chum Bucket], I really did it! ,[goes to the kitchen where Karen is mixing chum with the grinder], Hey, Karen, guess what?! I finally got the Krabby Patty secret formula! How do you like me now?
,Karen:, ,[scans the bottle until her screen says, ""Secret Formula equals Genuine""], It's genuine. Come here, you big hunk of aquatic organism! Ooh, I knew you could do it!,[hugs Plankton and kisses him], Just don't blow it this time. 
,[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is finishing up cleaning the office. He notices the Krabby Patty formula is gone from the trashcan.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Oh! Ahh! ,[looks all over the office], Hey, Squidward, have you seen the Krabby Patty secret formula? ,[lifts the desk and drops it], Ohh! ,[pulls out from underneath], I put it right here in this circular file cabinet.
,Squidward:, That's a trash can, you nitwit! ,[sits back but suddenly gets scared], The formula?! ,[cuts to them looking for the formula outside], Face it, SpongeBob! ,[gets trash thrown in his face], The formula—
,SpongeBob:, Don't say it!
,Squidward:, Is gone.
,SpongeBob:, ,[teary-eyed], Oh, I asked you not to say it! ,[unscrews his eyeballs and cries a fountain of tears], Why would you ever do that?
,Squidward:, ,[comforts SpongeBob], Come on. ,[throws him in through the window; cuts to them back in the office], Now let's see if the security cameras picked anything up. ,[pushes the button under Mr. Krabs' desk and a keyboard comes out], Hmm. ,[types on the keyboard and turns on the television while SpongeBob gasps in amazement],
,Patrick:, ,[on screen as he opens a trash can], Hi! I like to order—hmm—half a Krabby Patty, please! ,[digs in the trash can and pulls out a half-eaten Krabby Patty], Oh, thank you. ,[laughs then eats it],
,[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward types on the keyboard to go to another footage. The footage shows Bubble Bass reading a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book while eating a Krabby Patty. Squidwardr pans out the footage, only to show that Bubble Bass is literally doing all this on the toilet in the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward both exclaim and groan in disgust. Squidward types on the keyboard and goes to the next footage. The footage shows the Krabby Patty formula outside the Krusty Krab.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah! It's alive!
,Squidward:, Hold on. ,[types the keyboard and zooms in on the footage to reveal Plankton holding the formula], Plankton?
,SpongeBob:, Ahh! ,[his face falls off his body and falls over; he gasps], What are we gonna do?
,Squidward:, ,[grabs SpongeBob and breathes on him like an oxygen mask.], Okay. All right. We'll just pretend everything's normal until closing time. Then we'll steal the formula back from Plankton! Yeah!
,[Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is struggling to remove the cork from the bottle in hopes of reading the formula.],
,Plankton:, Come on! Open up! ,[tries to open it with his teeth but fails], Ahh! ,[tries to saw it open and stomp on it, but they also fail; posing as a genie from ""Spin the Bottle""], Open Sesame? ,[tries to burn it with a flamethrower, but it also fails as he ends up getting burned himself; he tries to blow it up with explosives, but it also fails as they blew up part of the Chum Bucket], It's no use, Karen. It won't budge.
,Karen:, Of course not, Einstein, it has a time lock. ,[points to time lock on the cork], It won't open until tomorrow morning.
,Plankton:, Well, I've waited this long. ,[opens the safe and puts the formula in it], What's a few more ,[closes the safe and talks loudly], excruciatingly long ,[calmly], hours? ,[turns the lock],
,[It is now nighttime at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs is locking the doors.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[nervously], Night, Mr. Krabs. Sleep tight.
,Squidward:, ,[nervously], Don't let the bed urchins bite.
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, sure. You, too, you two. ,[climbs in his boat and drives away home while SpongeBob and Squidward laugh nervously as they wave good-bye],
,Squidward:, Okay, let's go get that formula.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, we are gonna pull ,[imitates Plankton], a Plankton on Plankton! ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob and Squidward sneak behind the Chum Bucket. Squidward goes to the front doors, but a meow sound startles him.],
,Squidward:, Nyah! Whaa?
,SpongeBob:, ,[appears in a cat costume], Sorry. ,[laughs], Stepped on my tail.
,Squidward:, What are you wearing?
,SpongeBob:, I'm a cat burglar! ,[purrs and meows around Squidward and stops], Okay, I'll change. ,[rips off his cat costume],
,[SpongeBob and Squidward go to the front doors. Squidward attempts to push them open, but it is locked.],
,SpongeBob:, Hang on. ,[slips in underneath], Ooh.
,Squidward:, And just how am I supposed to get in? ,[SpongeBob grabs him by the legs and pulls him in underneath, accidentally ripping his eyes out], Ooh! ,[grumbles as he grabs his eyes and puts them back on his face],
,[SpongeBob peaks through the sewer lid and sees nothing around. He pops out and slides behind the Chum Bucket's menu. He slithers down from the wall, leaving two dents on his body. He and Squidward hide under a table. Squidward bashes SpongeBob on the head to straighten himself out. Plankton is seen watching a scary old movie.],
,TV Monster:, ,[growls],
,TV Actress:, Ahh!
,Plankton:, ,[slurps on soda and eats some popcorn], Yeah, yeah, now eat her brain! ,[sighs], I love a good romance. ,[turns off the TV and yawns],
,[Plankton hops off his chair while SpongeBob and Squidward hide under the table. Plankton scratches himself and goes into the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward follow him. Plankton flosses his teeth with his antenna. His machine brushes his teeth and pours mouth wash in Plankton's mouth. Plankton gargles the mouth wash and swooshes it up in his mouth. His machine places a hair curler on his antennas. He spits the mouth wash in a cup the machine is holding for him. Plankton dips his eyeball in the mouth wash, causing it to burn. The machine sprays eye drops in his eyeball to make it feel better. SpongeBob and Squidward made it to the bathroom where they almost got caught as Plankton exits through the small door. Plankton goes to the elevator and goes up.],
,SpongeBob and Squidward:, Phew.
,Plankton:, ,[exits the elevator], Good night, honey. ,[blow kisses to Karen],
,[Karen snores as she sleeps in her bed. Plankton hops onto his bed, claps his hands to turn off the lights and goes to sleep. SpongeBob sneaks into the bedroom through the doorknob. He slithers past Karen and goes to check on Plankton.],
,Squidward:, What are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Making sure he's asleep.
,[SpongeBob opens Plankton's eyelid and sees his eyeball snoring. SpongeBob gives Squidward a thumbs up, letting him know that Plankton is sound asleep. Squidward groans. The screen cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward tiptoeing all over the laboratory as they search for the formula. SpongeBob's pants and torso walk off, leaving SpongeBob's head and arms in tact in midair. SpongeBob hears a growling noise.],
,SpongeBob:, Yeesh! ,[runs over to Squidward as he torso and upper body reattach themselves], Squidward!
,[SpongeBob and Squidward scream as a monstrous shadow roars at them. They run around in panic until something pounces onto Squidward. It was Plankton's pet amoeba, Spot.],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, it's Plankton's little pet, Spot. He wants to play!
,Squidward:, ,[Spot is licking him all over], Will you get him off of me?! ,[tries to shake Spot off his legs],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm. Ahh! ,[grabs a fuel rod, which zaps his body as his skeleton is shown, and whistles], Get the stick, boy! ,[Spot sees the fuel rod and barks happily], Fetch! ,[throws the fuel rod and Spot goes after it through the front doors; SpongeBob then locks the doors shut],
,Squidward:, Look out!
,[A sleepy Karen rolls in behind SpongeBob.],
,Karen:, Diods...zebras...Make a new batch of chum...,[snores],
,SpongeBob:, It's okay. She's in sleep mode.
,Karen:, Oh, dear, the chum is escaping. ,[grabs SpongeBob and Squidward, stuffs them in the chum grinder and grinds them both into chum; she snores as she rolls away],
,[SpongeBob and Squidward, now grinded up into a pile of chum, slithers away. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Squidward hiding in empty toxic waste cans and rolling themselves over to the safe where Plankton is keeping the formula. They pop out of the cans and walk over to the safe.],
,Squidward:, This must be it.
,[SpongeBob pushes the buttons on the doors. The alarm goes off and an electric eye looks down on them.],
,Electric eye:, Remain still for retina scan.
,Squidward:, Now what'll we do?
,SpongeBob:, Good thing I brought this! ,[pulls out a criminal picture of Plankton], They really captured the cute little dimple on his chin.
,Squidward:, Looks like they captured the rest of him too!
,[The electric eye scans the picture and approved it. The electric eye closes itself up and opens the doors. The safe is at the far end.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh!
,Squidward:, I'll take it from here. ,[pushes SpongeBob aside],
,SpongeBob:, I'm fine.
,[Squidward goes for the safe, but he steps on a tile, setting off a trap. A giant boot squishes Squidward flat.],
,Squidward:, You go first this time.
,SpongeBob:, Hmm-mmph. ,[goes for the safe, but steps on a tile setting off another trap],
,[A hammer slams onto Squidward.],
,SpongeBob:, You okay? ,[steps on another tile, setting off another trap],
,Squidward:, No! ,[gets incinerated by fire underneath him],
,[SpongeBob moves over to a different tile, but sets off another trap. A pair of robot arms gives Squidward a wedgie. SpongeBob runs around in panic, stepping on more tiles and setting off more traps. A bowling ball crushes Squidward's foot.],
,Squidward:, Ow. ,[gets slapped in the face by a robotic arm],
,SpongeBob:, ,[stands on a tile and doesn't move as it sinks down into the floor], I'm standing still! I'm not even doing anything!
,[Squidward gets electrocuted by the electrical bolts. Then he gets crushes by a piano followed by a spiked-ball and a boat that resembles Titanic. Squidward is now reduced to liquid and slithers over to SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Heh...sorry. ,[gathers Squidward up and puts him in a bucket.],
,[SpongeBob walks over to the safe and revives Squidward back into his normal form. He turns the lock on the safe.],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh. ,[the safe opens to reveal the secret formula; he laughs], I can't believe that actually worked! ,[touches the bottle and the alarm goes off],
,[The tile below SpongeBob and Squidward sends them flying into a rocket. The rocket closes and blasts out from the Chum Bucket. They rocket crash lands in the back of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward roll out from the rocket and are completely singed and injured. It is now dawn and Mr. Krabs drives up to the front doors. He goes to unlock the doors and sees SpongeBob and Squidward.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Good morning, Krusty crew! Ready to cook up a new batch of Krabby Patties? Er...,[sees SpongeBob and Squidward singed and injured], Why are you two smoldering?
,SpongeBob:, We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
,Squidward:, ,[covers SpongeBob's mouth], No, he's delirious! He doesn't know what he's saying.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pushes Squidward away], No! Mr. Krabs deserves the truth. We accidentally threw away the Krabby Patty formula and Plankton found it! We tried to steal it back, but we failed! ,[sobs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gets really angry and smoke steams out of his eyestalks], You did ,what?!?!, Plankton stole me formula?!
,Squidward:, ,[he and SpongeBob nod their heads], That's what he said. Yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[calmly], Then I'll just have to steal it back. ,[walks over to the Chum Bucket], Hmm. Uh-huh. ,[punches a hole through the wall and grabs the secret formula from inside], Oh. ,[kisses the bottle], Don't worry. Papa's here.
,[The scene changes the scallop making its rooster call to Bikini Bottom. Plankton, now awake, goes to the safe.],
,Plankton:, Oh, yeah! ,[looks at himself with his pocket mirror], Who's the man? You are! Eh, man.
,[Plankton throws the mirror away. He turns the lock on the safe. He opens it and reveals Spot with the fuel rod barking happily at him. The hole behind Spot was the same hole Mr. Krabs made when he retrieved the formula. Spot jumps onto Plankton with the fuel rod and licks him while in doing so, zapping his body and showing his skeleton.],
,Plankton:, No, no, no! Krabs!
,[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], I'm sure glad the formula is back in the safe where it belongs, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Me, too, boy-o. And to make sure you two don't ever take your eyes off it again, I have a surprise for you. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward are stuffed in the safe], You're me new security system. ,[closes the safe and laughs before he leaves],

,Squidward:, Wait! I'm claustrophobic!

All Krusty Krew employees, attention! ,[Mr. Krabs is standing next to them, speaking into a megaphone], Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office! ,[pause], That will be all. ,[Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office and sit down], I have an important announcement to make.

,SpongeBob:, Right! ,[SpongeBob and Squidward shake hands],
,Squidward:, So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.

,Squidward:, Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward. ,[he winks to him], Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office, wearing the uniform], Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers? ,[laughs, then shuts the door. Krabs peeks his head out], Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.
,Squidward:, ,[with the uniform on. The two springs give and the K's fall over Squidward's eyes], Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
,Pearl:, Squidward is such a barnacle.
,SpongeBob:, A stick in the sand.
,Pearl:, But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.
,SpongeBob:, Me? Really?
,Pearl:, Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. ,[he looks at a picture he drew of Mr. Krabs, himself and Squidward with mustaches],
,Pearl:, Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess, ,[cut to a view of the Krusty Krab as a deserted place, where a skeleton is sitting at a table], we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.
,Pearl:, ,[cut to Pearl with a notepad, thinking], SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?
,Squidward:, ,[Squidward runs over], For what, dare I ask?
,Pearl:, The new name for our new look. I mean, ""The Krusty Krab"" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh! ,[she points the pencil towards her open mouth, to show disgust],
,Squidward:, Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?
,Pearl:, Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab? ,[puckers up lips and makes kissing noises],
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob is now in royal attire], The King Krab?
,Pearl:, ,[Pearl holds up a lollipop, which bears an odd resemblance to her father], The Kandy Krab!
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob dressed as a jazzy beatnik], The Kool Krab. ,[dresses as a cowboy riding a stick horse], Or the Kowboy Krab! ,[appears totally stretched out], The Kurly Krab. ,[appears as a mad scientist holding a brain with Mr. Krabs-like arms coming from it], The Kreepy Krab. ,[Appears as a crazy killer jungle man with a loincloth. Shouts scarily.], ,The Killer Krab!,
,Pearl:, ,[freaked out], Aaah! No!
,SpongeBob:, You're right, too scary. ,[they both think and finally get the name],
,SpongeBob and Pearl:, The Kuddly Krab! ,[Both happily hug and laugh. A rainbow of colors fills the screen. Pearl, SpongeBob and an anguished Squidward stand outside the new restaurant. The sign for the restaurant is now a heart and a cutesy robot Krabs is waving his arms atop it. The restaurant outside itself is tie-dyed with colors and rainbows and the flags are now hearts. Balloons are hanging from the roof and giant lollipops come from the chimney. Pearl and SpongeBob, giggling, walk back in the restaurant. Squidward is so mad that the two K's on his uniform catch on fire and he shakes the pole. Millie and Fred drive by in a car],
,Millie:, It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.
,Fred:, That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?
,Squidward:, That's it! I quit! ,[he rips off his uniform, revealing nothing under it. A police whistle is blown and a cop comes over. He writes him a ticket and places it between his legs. Inside the restaurant, it's a total makeover, like Pearl said before, it's a teenage paradise],
,Shelia:, Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out! ,[Pearl and SpongeBob admire their restaurant],
,SpongeBob:, Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.
,Pearl:, Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision. ,[blinks bashfully],
,SpongeBob:, Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill. ,[SpongeBob is in the kitchen at the grill], The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter. ,[he pushes his spatula on the grill and imitates a sizzle],
,Pearl:, ,[Pearl is in the ordering window to hand SpongeBob an order], SpongeBob, order up!
,SpongeBob:, Two... sa-,lads., Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a ,[pronounces it wrong], sa-,lad?, ,[cut to SpongeBob walking up to Pearl with a tray with two Krabby Patties], Here you go. Two sa-,lads.,
,Pearl:, Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.
,SpongeBob:, But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
,Pearl:, Exactly.
,SpongeBob:, All right. ,[walks back to the kitchen and sadly removes the top bun], Okay, no buns. That's hip. ,[removes the bottom buns and top buns], No patties, ,[removes the patties], happenin.' ,[crushed], Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.
,Nazz:, This is so cool!
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob walks over with a tray of salads to Nazz and Nancy at a table, who are talking], Two salads. ,[he drops the tray on the table and walks back to the kitchen], That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it. ,[he screams, noticing the grill is gone], Where's the grill?
,Pearl:, Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!
,SpongeBob:, Uh... right on.
,Pearl:, Check out this new menu I came up with. ,[SpongeBob takes the menu],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reading it], Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
,Pearl:, Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore. ,[takes the spatula from SpongeBob. He starts to stutter], I've got something more fun for you to do anyway. ,[cut to SpongeBob outside the restaurant in a crab suit, waving at cars. One car with Gus stops],
,Gus:, Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention! ,[laughs and drives off],
,SpongeBob:, This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much! ,[he walks toward the restaurant, but gravity gets the best of him and he falls over. He struggles to get up and starts to whimper. Cut to SpongeBob at Mr. Krabs' door, outside the costume], Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on... ,[he knocks on the door and peeks in], Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you? ,[Mr. Krabs' office is just as elaborately decorated as the rest of the restaurant],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Mr. Krabs. ,[he sits down in a bear bean bag chair, but starts to sink inside it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob has sunk in, now you can only see his eye], Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.
,Mr. Krabs:, Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob has totally sunk into the chair and he sticks out his hand], Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.
,Mr. Krabs:, How about my cuddly executive buddy? ,[picks up a blue stress-relief doll], Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95. ,[Krabs squeezes it and its eyes, nose and ears pop out],
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob pops out of the chair], Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! ,[he covers his mouth],
,Mr. Krabs:, What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab. ,[goes over to a picture of a seahorse], What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers? ,[goes to a strand of lights], How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?! ,[holds one up], It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money! ,[starts to cry], Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?
,SpongeBob:, There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's it, boy!
,SpongeBob:, What's it?
,Mr. Krabs:, You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.
,SpongeBob:, That's not what I said, sir. ,[Mr. Krabs brings SpongeBob to the door],
,Mr. Krabs:, Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office. ,[SpongeBob is pushed out the door and accidentally runs into Pearl],
,Pearl:, Totally rude, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?
,Pearl:, Sure, SpongeBob. ,[they walk to the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, ,[thinking], How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. ,[SpongeBob opens his mouth to say it, but Pearl is already crying],
,Pearl:, ,[crying], Oh, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob lets out a sigh of some relief],
,Pearl:, I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!
,SpongeBob:, Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-,lads!,
,Pearl:, No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob thinks for a second], I got it! I can pretend to ,[air quotes], ""fire you."" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.
,Pearl:, ,[Pearl grabs SpongeBob in a bone-snapping hug], Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[muffled], Stop trying to break me in half?
,Pearl:, ,[Pearl drops him], Deal. ,[cut to SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to Mr. Krabs' door, Pearl tries to conceal her laughing], Oh, boy!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing. ,[loud and clear], Pearl, I need to have a word with you! ,[we see Mr. Krabs in his office, sobbing],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.
,SpongeBob:, It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs is pushed against the door], Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way? ,[he sees himself in the uniform in the mirror], It's for the best.
,SpongeBob:, Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't let him do this! ,[he goes for the door, then sees the vault open. It's empty, and a spider crawls around its web], Get on with it, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Pearl, you're fired. ,[Mr. Krabs chokes and falls over],
,Pearl:, Thanks, SpongeBob. ,[kisses him. She runs off and jumps into a car with all her friends], Come on, gang, the mall awaits! ,[they drive off. SpongeBob runs into the office],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! ,[he screams when he sees Mr. Krabs' body. He runs over to a bill behind glass, which is for emergency purposes and he breaks the glass. He waves the bill under Mr. Krabs' nose],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[regaining consciousness], Oh, Pearly... ,[sniffs], Is that a $20? ,[he pockets the bill], Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood? ,[cries],
,SpongeBob:, There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.
,Mr. Krabs:, Really?
,SpongeBob:, She's off to bigger and better things.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man! ,[laughs], But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff? ,[SpongeBob thinks. Cut to his house, where all the stuff is put up in his house. SpongeBob dances in his uniform to the music],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughing], Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!
,Gary:, ,[Gary is covered in stuffed animals and his shell has flowers painted on it], Meow?

"[The beginning opens up to bikers riding by coral, setting them on fire as they ride by.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[at Jellyfish Fields], La la la la la. ,[attempts to catch a jellyfish], Missed ya. Uh-oh. ,[notices road], You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over. ,[motorcycles approaching. As they do, SpongeBob hangs onto ones jacket], The ""Ild Ones""! That's a strange name. ,[jacket tears], Scallop! ,[rolls in the cement], Bye ""Ild Ones."" I like your silly name. Hmm...""w."" Oh, oh, they're not the ""Ild Ones."" They must be the ""Wild Ones.""
,Fish:, ,[dressed in farmer outfit with a pick-ax in his hand pops up], The Wild Ones?! Tar nation! Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!
,SpongeBob:, No; I don't know who you are, either.
,Fish:, Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon! ,[laughs maniacally and then jumps back into the hole he was digging],
,SpongeBob:, Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut! ,[as the next scene of bubbles comes up, so does SpongeBob. Bubble pops inside of the Krusty Krab], Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?
,SpongeBob:, There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!
,Mr. Krabs:, Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?
,SpongeBob:, Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you going on about? Bikers?
,SpongeBob:, The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it? ,[cuts to later where a sign hangs that reads 'WELCOME WILD ONES!'], Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, this is serious! ,[cries and runs out],
,Mr. Krabs:, That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course. ,[cuts to The Wild Ones 25 miles from Bikini Bottom. Cuts once again to SpongeBob in front of Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! ,[knocks on door],
,Squidward:, Yes, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, A horrible biker gang called the ""Wild Ones"" are coming. We've got to run, hide! ,[crying],
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,Squidward:, Get a good grip on your pants. ,[SpongeBob does so], Turn around. ,[SpongeBob does so],
,SpongeBob:, Like this, Squidward?
,Squidward:, That's it. ,[kicks SpongeBob into the air. Cuts to SpongeBob landing next to Patrick, who is sniffing under his arm],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Hello, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom.
,Patrick:, ,[turns his back and crosses his arms], Huh.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?
,Patrick:, Oh, I heard you. But what ,didn't, hear was a hello.
,SpongeBob:, ,[annoyed], Hello, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Hello, SpongeBob. ,[realizes], Bloodthirsty bikers! Ah! We got to hide! ,[both run and scream then run into each other. Both run and scream again and keep hitting each other until they run through Jellyfish Fields. Patrick and SpongeBob hide in a giant clam until it spits them out. The giant clam uses mouthwash after that],
,Giant Clam #2:, Hey, what happened to you?
,Giant Clam #1:, ,[groaning], I... I don't want to talk about it, man. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick fly through kelp grass. As they hide in it, a mower comes by and mows them over, then uses a leaf blower to blow them into a pile. Both reform into their shapes and scream more],
,Patrick:, ,[jumps behind SpongeBob], Hide me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps behind Patrick], No, hide me!
,Patrick:, ,[jumps behind SpongeBob], Hide me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps behind Patrick], Me!

,Patrick:, ,[jumps behind SpongeBob], Me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps behind Patrick], Me!
,Patrick:, No! No more running.
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Patrick:, Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats ,[holds his pants], and their leather pants. ,[points to head],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up a black sock], Their leather socks.
,Patrick:, If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.
,SpongeBob:, Say that again, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Little baby doody-heads?
,SpongeBob:, No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers. ,[Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick putting on biker clothes. SpongeBob and Patrick put on biker pants, SpongeBob stretches his barefeet toes out to put on his biking boots, Patrick puts on a bike jacket, and then they put on biking helmets], What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?
,Patrick:, I wouldn't mess with ya.
,SpongeBob:, Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride. ,[cuts to later where Patrick and SpongeBob are revving their engines in the streets of Bikini Bottom. Zooms out to show they are riding bicycles], Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.
,Harold:, Ooh, I feel protected now.
,Scooter:, Those are some mean looking rides, dudes. ,[chuckles],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers. ,[cuts to Krusty Krab where they both enter inside], Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here.
,Patrick:, ,[drools], See?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, that's your salivation.
,Patrick:, Oh.
,SpongeBob:, So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?
,Squidward:, Does that part include laughing at you? ‘Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.
,SpongeBob:, Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?
,Patrick:, I'm bloodthirsty. See? ,[shows a cup with the word 'BLOOD' on it. He takes a sip], Want some?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood. ,[both take sips of their drinks], See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?
,Squidward:, No, I don't.
,Patrick:, What about our biker club?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, How about our biker organization?
,Squidward:, No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships.
,SpongeBob:, What about our coalition?
,Patrick:, Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out clipboard], We'll just pencil you down as undecided. ,[Squidward groans and walks away], Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.
,Mr. Krabs:, This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.
,SpongeBob:, Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.
,Mr. Krabs:, You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.
,SpongeBob:, Then can we save the town?
,Squidward:, Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react? ,[flashback shown], Squidward! We're out of napkins! ,[screams], Out of napkins! ,[another flashback to SpongeBob banging on Squidward's door], Squidward! I accidentally removed the ""Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law"" tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me! ,[another flashback], Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind! ,[Squidward turns on lights], Oh. Thanks, Squidward. ,[back to present],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. It's one of your many annoying traits.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Me? Annoying? ,[annoying laughter. Squidward growls], Yeah, right.
,Squidward:, You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way. ,[motorcycles approaching], What was that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy there, mateys. Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon.
,Squidward:, What? ,[grabs binoculars], Gimme that. ,[sees them coming. His eyes pop through the binoculars as he screams], Don't just stand there, save us!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together. ,[Patrick is already running away], Patrick? Patrick! ,[Patrick is headed into Jellyfish Fields and to the bus stop where a bus picks him up and takes him to a plane. Patrick jumps out of the plane and onto a rocket ship], Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...
,Squidward:, Panic! Run for your lives! ,[customers gasp], The Wild Ones are coming! ,[everyone screams and runs],
,Lenny:, The Wild Ones? ,[jumps into a sardine box], Mable, get the kids! ,[Mable jumps into the sardine box with Susie and Tyler and then closes it],
,Charlie:, Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what have I missed this time?
,Squidward:, ,[running out of the Krusty Krab], Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket. ,[shows a shirt with a skull on it], I want to ride to live and live to ride. ,[screams as the bikers ride in a circle around him], I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.
,Biker #1:, What's that, missy?
,Biker #2:, What?
,Biker #1:, Howdy, we're the ""Mild Ones"".

,Biker #1:, Gimme back my M. Let's go, boys.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't you want to spend any money?
,Biker #1:, Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride. ,[bikers ride off],

,SpongeBob:, Closing time. ,[sniffles], The saddest time of the day! ,[falls on the ground still crying], Huh? ,[he notices an old Patty under the grill], It's a Krabby Patty. ,[SpongeBob tries to pick it up but it's stuck to some gum], Eww... It's cold and hard. ,[takes the Patty out from under the grill], This could have rolled under there years ago. ,[pats it on the head], There, there, little one, your journey is almost over. ,[SpongeBob tosses the Patty in the trash. A siren goes off as a fishing line retrieves the patty],

,Mr. Krabs:, And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun. ,[hands it to SpongeBob],

,Mr. Krabs:, You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
,Narrator:, The next day...
,SpongeBob:, Order up, Squidward. ,[puts the tray with the old Patty on the window],
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Hooray. ,[smells the Patty then flips the top bun off. Flies buzz around the stinking patty.], Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
,Squidward:, Whatever. ,[he hands the tray to Gus], Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty. ,[Gus sniffs it. He screams with disgust and quickly back-flips his way out of the restaurant. Scene cuts to the Krusty crew standing by the door],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?
,Squidward:, What? ,[splutters in frustration at Krabs' stupidity], Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
,Mr. Krabs:, Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob. ,[picks up the cage with the Patty inside it], Uh, why is it in a cage?

,Mr. Krabs:, You have me word as a sailor. ,[scene cuts to the dilapidated Krusty Krab where a sign hangs over it that says 'Out of Business'],
,Squidward:, ,[looking through Mr. Krabs desk drawers], Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these. ,[SpongeBob is wearing his hat and holding his spatula, crying],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings. ,[sniffs], He won't like it!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back. ,[Wears a stethoscope. Tries to open the safe, putting a stethoscope onto the safe to avoid suspicion.], Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe. ,[Mr. Krabs walks in],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, boys! ,[SpongeBob screams with joy as Squidward sheepishly hides his stethoscope behind his back],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive! ,[clings to Mr. Krabs happily], Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
,Squidward:, ,[Deadpan],Well, it was.
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money, ,[mimics being infatuated to money], touching money... ,[returns back to normal talking], Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs. ,[scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where a giant 'Grand Re-Opening' sign is hanging. 'Buy' and 'Free' signs are in the window], Welcome all, welcome! ,[a little kid walks up to Krabs], Hello, little one. What you got there?
,Monroe:, A Krabby Patty.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?
,Monroe:, I don't go hungry?
,Mr. Krabs:, No, silly! It means free toy! ,[gives him a little toy],
,Monroe:, Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.
,Mr. Krabs:, I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills! ,[everyone cheers. Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob], Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'. ,[scene cuts to Squidward sleeping peacefully in a bed in Mr. Krabs' office],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Joyfully], Great!
,Martha:, Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes sir. ,[takes the patty and lifts the top bun where a disclaimer, written in ketchup form, is shown], Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! ,[puts down the bun], That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye, sir. ,[goes into the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, Sorry about the confusion. ,[pulls out a toy], Free toy? ,[Martha takes it, looking confused],
,Squidward:, Eugene, my man.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! How's the break coming?
,Squidward:, Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you? ,[Winks then walks off],
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy. ,[walks up to a customer watching a movie on a small television hanging from the ceiling], Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?
,Harold:, This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pats the customer on the back], No expense spared for my valued customers. ,[scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob standing in front of the restaurant], Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
,Squidward:, ,[walks in with some envelopes], Here's your mail, Eugene.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.
,Squidward:, Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me. ,[stretches and yawns a little],
,Mr. Krabs:, Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is. ,[opens the envelope], Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad. ,[runs up to the cash register], I'll just subtract it from today's profit. ,[opens the register, but there is no money in it], And... there's no money in here. ,[laughs], How delightful.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
,Squidward:, Me, too. How are we gonna get paid? ,[both walk up to Mr. Krabs], Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other surprised],
,Squidward:, Uh... ""dream""?
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
,SpongeBob:, Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
,Squidward:, Here's the bill. ,[hands Mr. Krabs the bill from earlier],
,Mr. Krabs:, You mean... I'm awake? ,[he screams as his head cracks through the middle over and over. Each time he cracks his head open, a new one appears. He races up to Nat drinking a Mountain Dew-like drink and he confiscates it from him], No more refills! ,[takes it to the soda machine and the drink gets sucked back into it like a vacuum. Then he runs up to two kids playing with toys. He steals them also.], Give me back them toys, you freeloaders! ,[He then runs back over to Harold watching the movie earlier], Show's over, cheapskate! ,[turns the TV off then presses a button that erases his memory of the movie. Harold goes dizzy.],
,Nathiel Waters:, Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny! ,[reaches for the penny],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs a hold of the customer's arm], Your luck just ran out!
,Nathiel Waters:, Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.
,Mr. Krabs:, Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off. ,[Flying Dutchman reappears. The customer runs away],
,Flying Dutchman:, A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... ,For eternity!,
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm not cheap, I'm generous!
,Squidward:, You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sarcastically], Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you. ,[Flying Dutchman picks him up], Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.
,SpongeBob:, Wait just a burger-flipping second!
,[Flying Dutchman turns around],
,Flying Dutchman:, Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?
,SpongeBob:, That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea. ,[Mr. Krabs is happy at SpongeBob's words],
,Flying Dutchman:, He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.
,SpongeBob:, I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
,Flying Dutchman:, You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?
,Mr. Krabs:, That depends, how much money we talking about?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[shows money], 62 cents.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll take the money.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Flying Dutchman:, Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents. ,[hands him the change and picks up SpongeBob], Next stop: Davy Jones' locker! ,[SpongeBob screams as they both disappear],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Runs to Squidward, happy], Look, Squidward, money!
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?
,Mr. Krabs:, You think I could've gotten more?
,Squidward:, He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Briefly looks at his change in a sad way until he starts to cry.], Oh, what have I done? ,[cries], I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money! ,[throws the change on the ground], I want SpongeBob back! ,[Flying Dutchman reappears and drops SpongeBob on the floor],
,Flying Dutchman:, Here, take him back.
,Mr. Krabs:, You heard what I said about the money?
,Flying Dutchman:, Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Flying Dutchman at Davy Jones' locker with SpongeBob talking a lot], And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!
,SpongeBob:, ,[In the Davy Jones' locker scene, talking simultaneously with the Flying Dutchman's explanations, talking super quickly], Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!
,Flying Dutchman:, He's your problem now. ,[laughs evilly as he disappears],
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh, about trading you for pocket change...
,SpongeBob:, Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.
,Mr. Krabs:, You would have?
,SpongeBob:, No. ,[all laugh. Scene cuts to the Flying Dutchman sitting on a chair, reading a book until the phone rings],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[picks up phone], Dutchman's residence.
,SpongeBob:, ,[on the other end, talking super quickly], So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work. ,[Flying Dutchman groans], I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.

"[No customers are at the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, Squidward is reading a ballet magazine and imagining his head on the dancers, and SpongeBob is wiping dust off tables.],
,[Closer shot of Mr. Krabs holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, attempting to retain his smile. Piece of paper flies through the open door of the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, ,what will?!, ,[Squidward is dancing], Squidward!
,Squidward:, Uh-uh... Yes, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, There's gonna be some changes around here. ,[Francis walks in. Mr. Krabs gasps], A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab! ,[runs up to Francis with a chair and seats him. Brings him back to the table], SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, ,you, are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?
,Francis:, All I wanted was change for the payphone. ,[shows the dollar],
,SpongeBob:, Aye-aye, sir! ,[runs off quickly and comes back with change. Talking in a French accent], Monsieur's change. ,[snaps his fingers],
,Francis:, Thanks. ,[laughs nervously and leaves a penny on the table], Here you go. ,[runs off as Mr. Krabs smells the penny],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah! ,[jumps on it. Later, Mr. Krabs' puts the penny away in his safe in his office and is with Squidward and SpongeBob], Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month. ,[pulls down a chart with zig-zag lines going down and his eyes sticking out on each side], We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers. ,[pulls the chart up], Do you lubbers have any ideas?
,SpongeBob:, I've got one! ,[takes out a tray with a soda and a pair of socks on it], A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... ,[talks with mouth full of clams], ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment. ,[Squidward gasps],
,Squidward:, That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me! ,[runs up to Mr. Krabs with stars in his eyes], This is the moment I've... ,[eyes return to normal], I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.
,Mr. Krabs:, The money? ,[Squidward is lying on the table],
,Squidward:, And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs looks at his picture of him and Pearl], Little Pearly... a star?
,SpongeBob:, Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! ,[runs off as Squidward and Mr. Krabs shake hands],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star! ,[later, the restaurant is being redecorated for the show. Squidward is writing notes on a notepad.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?
,Squidward:, Going on what?
,SpongeBob:, The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!
,Squidward:, What talent could you possibly possess? ,[SpongeBob blows a big bubble which turns into a hippo. Then blows two small bubbles for the hat and cane. Both dance],
,SpongeBob:, Ta-da! ,[Squidward yawns],
,Squidward:, No one, not even your parents, would want to see that. ,[hippo bubble pops], What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
,SpongeBob:, Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!
,Squidward:, I can hardly wait. ,[SpongeBob runs off], Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes. ,[laughs], Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. ,[now the night of the talent show where people are outside conducting interviews and people inside are talking and getting set-up],
,Lisa:, ,[Talking in the background], We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...
,SpongeBob:, ,[peeks out from behind the curtain], Wow! A full house! ,[gasps], There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! ,[Mr. Krabs shakes Mr. SquarePants' hand],
,Mr Krabs:, Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs, and I like money.
,SpongeBob:, I gotta get ready! ,[Squidward gets everyone's attention],
,Squidward:, Alright, people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop. ,[performers gather around], Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? ,[runs off and runs back with a tub full of water and the words 'Mister Absorbency' written on the front], The Amazing Mister Absorbency! ,[puts his finger in the water and absorbs it. Absorbs the water into his legs], Ta-da! ,[absorbs water into his head], Ta-da!
,Squidward:, No one is going to watch you engorge yourself. ,[grabs Squidward's legs],
,SpongeBob:, Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!
,Squidward:, So you really want to be in the show?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yes!
,Squidward:, Okay, you get to mop up afterwards. ,[hands SpongeBob a mop], Now will you stop bugging me? ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! ,[show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo],
,Squidward:, Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. ,[Patrick laughs], Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. ,[Patrick laughs again], Put your fins together for... ,[Patrick cracks up laughing very hard. Bashes on the table with laughter, shaking dinnerware. He falls off his chair], Put your... ,[Patrick laughs], Put... ,[Patrick laughs], Pearl. ,[crowd claps as curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheerleader uniform],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
,Pearl:, Give me a K-R-U! ,[jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her], Give me a S-T-Y! ,[jumps up and down again], Krusty Krab! ,[jumps up and down], Krusty Krab! ,[jumps up and down], Krusty Krab! ,[jumps up and down],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[He, Patrick, and SpongeBob's parents get tossed up and down. Mr. Krabs appear happy.], That's what I call talent! ,[Krusty Krab floor is destroyed],
,Pearl:, Thank you!
,Fred:, My leg! Ugh!
,Pearl:, Thank you, thank you! ,[Squidward closes curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water.],
,Squidward:, ,[Screams in shock],
,SpongeBob:, Hey Squidward, listen. What do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. ,[Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage],
,Squidward:, And now, poetry. ,[walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain], By Gary. ,[curtain opens. Gary is on a stool],
,Gary:, ,[clears throat], Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
,Sandy:, He has such a way with words.
,Squidward:, ,[checks his watch], Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me! ,[SpongeBob walks up],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?
,Squidward:, Yes. ,[audience applauds as curtain opens, revealing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!'],
,Plankton:, I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... ,[turns his wand into flowers], ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. ,[throw the flowers aside], First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. ,[jumps onto a table and grabs the Krabby Patty from the customer. Runs toward the door, but Mr. Krabs stops Plankton],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice try. Your act's over, bub. ,[grabs the patty],
,Plankton:, You may win this time. Shia-kazing! ,[he claps his hands and ignites into a mini-explosion. The smoke from the explosion clears and he is completely charred], Well, this stinks. ,[he walks off and is booed. Mr. Krabs runs up to Squidward backstage, leaving a trail of flames],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! ,[Literally races towards him, like an overspeeding race car], This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
,Squidward:, Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
,Mr. Krabs:, For your sake, I hope you're right. ,[bunch of spot lights gleam around Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! ,['Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights. Curtain opens and the background shows a canyon. Squidward dances with birds, accompanied by classical music. Then the lights go dark and music becomes techno as Squidward dances weirdly. Makes weird noises as he dances after the first part of his dance.],
,Fish:, What the?!
,[Squidward continues to dance weirdly. Crowd boos and pelts tomatoes at Squidward],
,Mr Krabs:, I'm losing money on this deal! ,[puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar. Grins.],
,Fred:, It's worth every penny. ,[everyone runs up to Mr. Krabs with dollar bills in hand],
,Squidward:, You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
,Crowd:, No talent! No talent! No talent! ,[curtain closes],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?
,Squidward:, Yeah, show's over! ,[crown continues booing as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him],
,Crowd:, Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that. Alright! ,[SpongeBob briefly stops mopping and the crowd becomes silent. He then starts mopping faster getting even more applause. He then leaves stage right and the applause stops. He peeks from where he left and mops the floor while leaving stage left which starts the applause again. He waves goodbye to the crowd],
,Squidward:, They want an encore! ,[pushes SpongeBob away], Stand aside, SpongeBob! ,[Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage and SpongeBob comes back out mopping and crowd cheers again. SpongeBob leaves stage left as Squidward jumps out again and the crowd instantly becomes silent again. Squidward is angry.],
,[Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. Then shows the crowd SpongeBob and they cheer. Then he puts his own head through the curtain and the crowd goes silent.],
,[SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer, but Squidward's does not. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent.],
,[Squidward stops and he is angry. He tries to mop somewhere else to impress them. He then raises his hands up in a ta-da moment, but someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Backstage, Harold and Margaret SquarePants bring Mr. Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of money],
,Mr. Krabs:, You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Oh, my son's a star!
,Mr. SquarePants:, Who ever knew he had such talent.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show! ,[crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob],

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward are picking up trash and cleaning the tables.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, I don't know what I love more, Squidward, feeding people Krabby Patties during the day, or cleaning up their mess at night.
,Squidward:, ,[growls], Are you kidding me? Look at all this garbage those animals left behind. Hm.
,Patrick:, ,[pops out of the garbage], One man's garbage... ,[eats an onion],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps and sees gum under the table], So much gum! Ooh, this is gonna be fun. Ooh-wah! ,[spins the table around and sends gum flying towards Squidward],
,Squidward:, Ow! Hey, watch it— ,[gets gums stuffed in his mouth],
,[Squidward chokes on the gum and blows a big bubble. The bubble pops and sends Squidward flying into the wall, splattering garbage everywhere. He slides off the wall and lands on the floor. Suddenly, his nose picks up a foul stench. The stench is coming from a really rotten and aged Krabby Patty.],
,Squidward:, ,[Scared], Ah! Urchin!
,SpongeBob:, That's no urchin, it's a Krabby Patty.
,Squidward:, ,[Disgusted], Yuck. A rotten Krabby Patty. ,[sweeps up the patty and goes to throw it away],
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Squidward! You can't throw out a Krabby Patty. That is just wrong.
,Squidward:, But this one is rotten.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, simple Squidward... ,[flips Squidward's nose], No Krabby Patty can ever truly be rotten. Here, look... ,[takes a bite of the rotten patty],
,Squidward:, Ah!
,SpongeBob:, Mmm... ,[suddenly, without warning, he starts to feel really sick to the stomach and burps the rotten patty, realizing Squidward was right.],
,Squidward:, ,[cruelly smiles], Oh, that looks delicious. ,[Places the patty in front of SpongeBob], Why don't you take another bite?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Nervously],No thanks. Uh, it's so delicious, I think I'll save the rest for later. ,[puts the rotten patty in his pocket and gags],
,[SpongeBob runs out to the back of the restaurant and groans from the sickness in his stomach.],
,SpongeBob:, No, Patty, you stay where you are. ,[groaning],
,[A mysterious shadow looms in over SpongeBob and a furry, brown arm touches his shoulder.],
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Are you doing all right there, friend?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I—I'm all right. ,[turns around and sees a giant fluffy hamster; gasps], Yoo-hoo! What are you?
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Why, I'm your new best friend. You can call me Cuddle E. Hugs. ,[straightens his tie],
,SpongeBob:, New best friend? I like the sound of that.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Then bring it in for the real deal!
,SpongeBob:, Whee! ,[hugs Cuddle E. Hugs], That's what I call a hug. ,[sighs],
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Of course it is! Hugs is my last name, after all. ,[kisses SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, So tender.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, I try. But enough of this. How about you show your new best friend around town?
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Cuddle E. Hugs.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Cuddle E. Hugs riding a bicycle around Bikini Bottom. Then they play the hand clapping game, patty-cake.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Wow! ,[laughs], Wow!
,[Then Cuddle E. Hugs tickles SpongeBob while they are at the park. The Bikini Bottomites, on the other hand, look at SpongeBob very strangely. The scene changes to dusk as SpongeBob brings Cuddle E. Hugs home to his house.],
,Gary:, Meow. Huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], What a great night!
,[Cuddle E. Hugs squeezes through his door.],
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Gary. Say hello to my new best friend, Cuddle E. Hugs.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, A pleasure.
,[Gary looks around and sees nothing. It turns out that Cuddle E. Hugs is not real and SpongeBob is actually hallucinating from the rotten Krabby Patty he ate.],
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Gary. Bed time.
,Gary:, Meow!
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Mm! Ooh!
,SpongeBob:, Here's my room. You can take the bed, if you want.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Nonsense. We can share it! ,[jumps on the bed, but shatters it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets hit by some debris], Ow!
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, ,[laughs], Looks like your friend Cuddle E. Hugs needs to lay off the snacks. But no need to worry, SpongeBob, I got your new bed right here.
,SpongeBob:, Ha! Ha! Whoo-hoo! Hooray! ,[he gets lifted and placed on Cuddle E. Hugs' belly; the fur is so soft and SpongeBob enjoys it so much], You are the absolute best at snuggles.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, I didn't get the first name Cuddle for nothing. ,[both laugh],
,[The next day, SpongeBob is sleeping on the mattress of his crushed bed. He stretches and yawns.],
,SpongeBob:, How'd you sleep, Cuddle E.? ,[gasps and sees no sign of Cuddle E. Hugs], Oh, good morning, Gary. Hey, have you seen Cuddle E. Hugs anywhere?
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, Where could he have gone? Aw, what if I never see him again or feel his furry embrace? ,[sighs], Maybe a bite of Krabby Patty will make me feel better. ,[takes out the rotten patty and eats it],
,Gary:, ,[grossed out], Meow...
,[SpongeBob feels sick from the rotten patty and starts to hallucinate again.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[groaning], I don't feel so good. I must miss Cuddle more than I thought.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, And I miss you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps as he sees Cuddle E. Hugs], You're still here!
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Of course I am!
,SpongeBob:, Yee-hee! ,[jumps in Cuddle E. Hugs' arms and hugs him; Cuddle E. Hugs kisses him in the head], Aw. Wow! That kiss was even more tender than the first one.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, I've been practicing. It's our ability to give tender head kisses that separates us from lower life forms, SpongeBob. ,[puts SpongeBob down],
,SpongeBob:, Did you hear that, Gary? Come here. ,[kisses Gary in the eye stalks],
,[Gary meows disgustedly and wipes SpongeBob's saliva off his eyes.],
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, So, best friend, what should we do today?
,SpongeBob:, You should meet my other friends. They are gonna love you. ,[opens the door],
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, I already love them! ,[grunts as he squeezes through the front door],
,Gary:, Meow...
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Cuddle E. Hugs walking down the street. They stop and see Squidward strolling along with a basket of bread and wine.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh—ooh, there's my buddy, Squidward! You're gonna love him. He's funny and nice and very polite. Hey, Squidward! Hi! I said hey, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Please get out of my way, and stop talking to me.
,SpongeBob:, See, Cuddle E.? He said please. I told you he was polite.
,Squidward:, Who are you talking to?
,SpongeBob:, My new best friend. Wanted you to meet him.
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], I don't have time for your stupid games. Now move it! ,[kicks SpongeBob aside],
,SpongeBob:, Ah! ,[Squidward proceeds to stroll along; SpongeBob sits up and chuckles], Sorry about that. I—I don't know what's gotten into him today.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, No need to be sorry, SpongeBob. I'm your best friend! ,[he and SpongeBob hug],
,[Patrick skips along and notices SpongeBob hugging the air.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw, your furry tummy feels like home.
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, why are you hugging the air?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, I'm not hugging the air. I'm hugging Cuddle E. Hugs.
,Patrick:, Uh, mm... ,[looks around and doesn't see anything], Are you playing some kind of trick on me? There's no one there.
,SpongeBob:, Course there's someone here. He's my new best friend.
,Patrick:, ,[groans sadly], But I'm your best friend.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yes, you are, but so is Cuddle E. Hugs, and I have enough love in my heart for both of you.
,[SpongeBob hugs Patrick and his unseen friend, Cuddle E. Hugs. Patrick gets really angry as he felt betrayed and pushes SpongeBob away.],
,Patrick:, No! I want all your love! ,[growls], Give me it! ,[goes to fight with Cuddle E. Hugs, but he's only fighting himself], SpongeBob's my best friend! Mine! ,[flips himself and swings around], Give me his love! ,[punches the air and gets beaten up], No! No, no! ,[babbling as he spins around],
,Sandy:, ,[arrives at the scene], What's up with Patrick? He looks madder than a rattlesnake in a room full of rocking chairs.
,SpongeBob:, I just tried to introduce him to my friend, Cuddle E. Hugs, and he went crazy! In fact, everyone's acting weird. They're all pretending they can't see him.
,Sandy:, Well, where is this new friend of yours?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, not you too, Sandy! He's standing right there!
,Sandy:, Huh? ,[looks around but doesn't see anything], Well, I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but I don't see anyone.
,SpongeBob:, He's the giant hamster, right there! ,[sulks down],
,Sandy:, Oh, I get it. He's your ,[makes a rainbow over her head with her hands], imaginary friend.
,SpongeBob:, But he's not imaginary! He's real!
,Sandy:, Oh, no need to get so fiery, SpongeBob. It's okay to have an imaginary friend. Lots of people do. You two have fun, ya hear? ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, What is going on around here? I was so excited to introduce you to my friends, but now they're all acting strange.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, I hate to see ya upset, SpongeBob. But take heart. There's a reason your friends can't see me.
,SpongeBob:, There is?
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Of course! Unlike you, they never ate the magic sandwich.
,SpongeBob:, Magic sandwich? What magic sandwich?
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Why, the one that's fuzzy as me, of course.
,SpongeBob:, You mean the moldy Krabby Patty I found at work?
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, You say moldy Krabby Patty, I say magic sandwich.
,SpongeBob:, Hmm... Maybe I should share my magic sandwich with my friends. That way, they can see you, and see how awesome you are!
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Yes! Let them witness my fuzzy tummy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Tummy... ,[rubs Cuddle E. Hugs' tummy, which makes him giggle], Tummy, tummy, tummy, tummy, tummy.
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob chops the rotten Krabby Patty into pieces. The knife melts from the horrid stench.],
,SpongeBob:, There! Enough for everyone.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Excellent, SpongeBob. ,[cackles],
,[SpongeBob and Cuddle E. Hugs laugh. But, unknown to SpongeBob, Cuddle E. Hugs is laughing manically than normal.],
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, ,[stops laughing], Okay, let's go. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm? ,[takes a piece of rotten patty and puts it in his pocket; he giggles; then he sets up a stand for him to sell the rotten pieces of the patty], Aged Krabby Patties here! Get your artisanal aged Krabby Patties here! ,[the customers, including Patrick, are not interested and continue to eat], Did I mention they were free?
,[The customers are now interested. They run up and they each get a piece of the rotten Krabby Patty.],
,Sandy:, Mmm. ,[screams and groans in sickness],
,[Patrick eats the piece of the rotten Krabby Patty and then starts to feel sick.],
,SpongeBob:, Do you see him, Patrick? Do you see Cuddle E. Hugs?
,[And just like what happened to SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy and the customers begin to hallucinate and they see Cuddle E. Hugs.],
,Patrick:, ,[gasps], Yes! Oh, he's glorious!
,Nat Peterson:, Yeah, his fur looks silkier than actual silk.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, ,[suddenly turns evil as he pretends to be friendly], Yes, make them all see me, SpongeBob! Make them all see, Cuddle E. Hugs!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what are you doing giving away free food? Are you cra—
,[SpongeBob throws a piece of the rotten patty in Mr. Krabs' mouth. He chokes on it and starts to feel sick. And just like everyone else, he hallucinates and see Cuddle E. Hugs too. He giggles and runs over to Cuddle E. Hugs to hug him.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't resist the fuzzy.
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, ,[cackles], Come, everyone, and hug your new best friend!
,[Patrick, Sandy, and the customers jump onto Cuddle E. Hugs and everyone becomes fascinated by the warm and comfort of his fur. However, Cuddle E. Hugs began to act evil and one by one, he starts devouring everyone.],
,SpongeBob:, No, Cuddle E. Hugs, no!
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Yes, SpongeBob SquarePants, yes! ,[eats another one of the customers],
,Squidward:, ,[arrives at the front door], Sorry, I'm late, I... ,[sees everyone hallucinating from the rotten Krabby Patty pieces as they pile up each other and run around like crazy], Um...back to bed. ,[leaves for home],
,[Cuddle E. Hugs cackles and goes to eat SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, I thought we were friends! ,[gets thrown in Cuddle E. Hugs' mouth],
,[The next morning, everyone wakes up, moaning and groaning.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[groans], What happened?
,Patrick:, ,[gets up and is very angry], Oh... Well, your friend ate me is what happened! Not cool!
,[The customers grumble in agreement.],
,Patrick:, Yeah, grumble!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, everyone.
,[The customers stomp to the front door. SpongeBob gets flicked off by a strong man and falls in Sandy's arms.],
,Sandy:, You need to imagine your friends more carefully, SpongeBob. ,[drops SpongeBob and leaves in disgust],
,[After the customers left in disgust and anger, SpongeBob is left all alone.],
,SpongeBob:, I just don't get it. Why did he act like that last night? I thought we were BFFs. I need to talk to him.
,[SpongeBob takes out the extra piece of the rotten Krabby Patty and eats it. He feels sick and starts to hallucinate again.],
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Crazy time last night, right, bro? ,[elbows SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Don't ""bro"" me, Cuddle E. Hugs! You embarrassed me last night, and you ate all my friends! Why would you do that?
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, Didn't you ever wonder what the E in my name stands for? It's Eat! I'm always hungry, ya know?
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Well, why didn't you say so? Here, have the last of my patty.
,[SpongeBob throws the last of the rotten patty in Cuddle E. Hugs' mouth and he starts to feel sick.],
,Cuddle E. Hugs:, ,[groans], Wait, no! No! ,[hallucinates as a real hamster in a little girl's bedroom with SpongeBob stuff around], What? Oh, pellets.

"[SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off],
,SpongeBob:, This is it, Gary!
,Gary:, Meow. ,[SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words ""boating exam today!"" on it then drops to the floor],
,SpongeBob:, The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! ,[A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle], I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
,Squidward:, What?
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready, Squidward! ,[SpongeBob rides his unicycle around Squidward's house],
,Squidward:, Ready to move?
,SpongeBob:, No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. ,[Rides his unicycle towards the school], I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... ,[stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it], I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. ,[throws the unicycle into the dumpster], I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!

,Mrs. Puff:, ,[sighs], I'm not ready. ,[opens the door],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[with clipboard and pen in hand], We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
,SpongeBob:, First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
,Mrs. Puff:, I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
,SpongeBob:, The bow. ,[Mrs. Puff writes down his answer],
,Mrs. Puff:, What is the back?
,SpongeBob:, Stern. ,[Mrs. Puff writes down his answer],
,Mrs. Puff:, #3: Right is...

,Mrs. Puff:, You've passed the oral test. What a surprise! ,[gets in the boat and secures herself tightly], Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, in this boat right here? ,[looks at his watch], Is it time already?
,Mrs. Puff:, Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Oh yeah, absolutely. ,[gets in],
,Mrs. Puff:, All you have to do is get on the track. ,[looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer], Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
,SpongeBob:, 1924?
,Mrs. Puff:, No, no. First thing is to start the boat. ,[Mrs. Puff turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy], SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
,SpongeBob:, The boat?
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay, now what do you do next?
,SpongeBob:, Floor it?
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
,SpongeBob:, Floor it?
,Mrs. Puff:, No, no, don't, don't floor it.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, floor it.
,Mrs. Puff:, No! No! ,[SpongeBob pushes the accelerator down and starts driving backwards really fast by some spectators and drives into a lighthouse. After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates and becomes big and round with a deep voice], Oh, SpongeBob, why?
,Fred:, My leg!
,SpongeBob:, ,[in his bed], I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, thirty-eight. ,[puts his pillow on his head],
,Gary:, ,[puts on SpongeBob's boots], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, No, Gary, I'm not walking.

,Patrick:, ,[through walkie-talkie], I got a surprise for you.

,SpongeBob:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Okay, now what, Patrick?
,Patrick:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Go to your closet for a surprise. ,[SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door],
,SpongeBob:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Okay, I'm at the closet.
,Patrick:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
,SpongeBob:, ,[through walkie-talkie], I don't know, Patrick. ,[SpongeBob opens the closet door and Patrick has one of SpongeBob's SquarePants on],
,Patrick:, Patrick SquarePants!
,SpongeBob:, ,[deadpan], Pat, don't do that. ,[sits in a chair], I've got too much to worry about.
,Patrick:, What's the problem?
,SpongeBob:, I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers... ,[Patrick's square pants rip off], ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
,Patrick:, Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. ,[takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie],
,SpongeBob:, How are we going to do that? ,[Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top],
,Patrick:, Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
,SpongeBob:, Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. ,[SpongeBob notices the antenna sticking out], Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? ,[Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window],
,Patrick:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing. ,[looking through the telescope at SpongeBob], Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! Testing! ,[loudly], Testing! ,[screams], Test. Do you read?!
,SpongeBob:, Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
,Patrick:, ,[through walkie-talkie], Got your apple ready? ,[SpongeBob shows an apple], Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on. ,[Patrick focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it], Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. ,[SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and on the ground and starts chewing grass],
,SpongeBob:, Moo.
,Patrick:, ,[through walkie-talkie], No, no, get in the boat! ,[SpongeBob jumps in the boat. A siren is heard as Mrs. Puff comes out an ambulance and into the boat], Give her the apple. ,[SpongeBob gives her the apple],
,SpongeBob:, Here you go, ma'am. ,[Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows],
,Mrs. Puff:, Let's get this over with. ,[takes a deep breath], What's the first thing you do? ,[puts hands and arms over head for protection],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh...

,SpongeBob:, It's okay, it's only the boat.
,Mrs. Puff:, The boat? You started the boat?
,SpongeBob:, I... I think so.
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
,SpongeBob:, 1924?
,Patrick:, ,[through walkie-talkie], No, no, put it in drive.

,Mrs. Puff:, No! ,[screams], No!

Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Splendid! Wonderful! ,[sign that reads finish line is just ahead], There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? ,[everyone laughs], Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? ,[everyone laughs], And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? ,[everyone laughs], Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. ,[SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating],
,Patrick:, Cheating! ,[laughing hysterically],
,SpongeBob:, I'm cheating?! Mrs Puff!
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes, my star pupil?
,SpongeBob:, I think I'm cheating.
,Mrs. Puff:, What's that, dear? ,[SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff],
,SpongeBob:, I think I am cheating!
,Mrs. Puff:, You've... you've let go of the wheel.

,Mrs. Puff:, No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way!
,SpongeBob:, No... I'm cheating...!
,Mrs. Puff:, At least, SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Cheating!
,Mrs. Puff:, Cheat that way!

,Mrs. Puff:, It's okay to cheat today!
,SpongeBob:, No...!
,Mrs. Puff:, That way! Cheat that way!
,SpongeBob:, Cheater...! ,[crashes off screen into the lighthouse again, Mrs. Puff inflates again],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[manly voice], Oh, SpongeBob, why?
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
,Fred:, My leg!
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. ,[EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. ,[Mrs. Puff screams as she is taken away by the ambulance], It'll be great! ,[walks away], Only now I don't even have my bike.

,SpongeBob:, 97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that? ,[Gary is confused, then SpongeBob walks outside, and over to Squidward], Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?
,SpongeBob:, Breathing.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace.

,Squidward:, Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here.
,SpongeBob:, I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday. ,[Squidward gets up], Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--

,Squidward:, Yes?
,SpongeBob:, Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?
,Squidward:, Oh, ,[laughs], that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it.
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Squidward:, So I could get further away from you! ,[rushes off],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward.

,SpongeBob:, Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here.

,Squidward:, Do you mind?
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.
,Squidward:, ,We, won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?
,Mrs. Puff:, Quiet in the front please.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy.
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to I mean why we are enrolled in boating school.
,Student:, Um, I got caught speeding.
,Mrs. Puff:, Very good. Next.
,Student:, I don't see what's so very good about it.
,Mrs. Puff:, No, I didn't mean very.
,Student:, ,[sighs], I know exactly what you meant.
,Mrs. Puff:, Next.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I am here because I.
,Mrs. Puff:, We all know why you're here, SpongeBob. What about you, sir? ,[referring to Squidward],
,Squidward:, Me?
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today?
,Squidward:, Why I'm. ,[sees SpongeBob staring, and breathing at him], All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!
,Mrs. Puff:, Yours too? Uhh. What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident.
,Squidward:, Gladly. ,[begins drawing what he is saying], It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here. ,[referring to Squidward's house], Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in ,[screeches the chalk board], evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?
,Mrs. Puff:, Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story.
,Squidward:, His side?
,SpongeBob:, Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then ,[continues writing, without speaking], and then I went around, and stopped right here. ,[We See The Bubbly Transition],
,Everyone:, SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever. ,[all are confused, then SpongeBob sits down],
,SpongeBob:, Do you like it Squidward?
,Squidward:, Shut it. ,[bell rings, then cuts to everyone eating lunch, and SpongeBob sits next to Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy? ,[SpongeBob sits, and Squidward walks away, over to the trash cans],
,Squidward:, I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school. ,[Squidward is about to eat, then SpongeBob pops up from a trash can],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, do you have any mustard in there? ,[Squidward runs away screaming, then cuts to the bathroom, where Squidward is eating],
,Squidward:, Mm, bon appetite, Squidy. ,[is about to eat, but then sees SpongeBob's feet in the other stall. Squidward gets angry, and throws his sandwich on the ground], You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my... ,[door opens, revealing that it's a muscular tough fish, with feet that look like SpongeBob's. Scene cuts to Squidward walking to his seat, bandaged up],
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob.
,Squidward:, Eh, didn't see that coming. ,[cuts to them in a boat],
,Mrs. Puff:,  Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb?
,SpongeBob:, Uh, step on the gas?
,Mrs. Puff:, Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly... ,[SpongeBob steps on the pedal, and Mrs. Puff screams],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, look out! ,[they bump through the cones, then they barge out through the fence, then they go through a red light], SpongeBob, give me that wheel!
,SpongeBob:, I got it, I got it. ,[they fight over it],
,Squidward:, Just let go of it! ,[the steering wheel breaks, and Mrs. Puff screams. They drive into grandma],
,Grandma:, Hooligans! ,[they drive through the Barg 'n Mart, and a costume shop, and they are about to drive into a secret lab],
,Scientest 1:, Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mail man, down to the size of a grain of sand.
,Scientist 2:, How?
,Scientist 1:, By using this shrink ray. ,[he pulls a lever that turns it on, then the boat comes in, and they get shrunk instead],
,Scientist 2:, Mother of mercy! ,[they shrink], Where'd they go?
,Scientist 1:, There! They're heading right for that discarded potato chip. ,[mail man growls],
,Scientist 2:, What's the matter?
,Scientist 1:, Potato chips are his favorite snack. ,[he breaks out], Johnson! No! ,[is about to eat it, but then gets sprayed with water],
,Scientist 2:, No, no, no. ,[they then go through a drain. A cowboy is about to drink from a drinking fountain, but then Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob come out and return to normal size],
,Cowboy:, I never will understand these city folk.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, where'd Squidward go? ,[the tough fish from earlier is going to go to the bathroom again, and Squidward returns to normal in the toilet],
,Squidward:, I was just leaving. ,[cuts to Squidward walking toward his desk all bandaged up],
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay class, it's time to take our final exam. Please have your pencils ready.
,SpongeBob:, Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and-
,Squidward:, ,[furious], How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it.
,Squidward:, Thank you. ,[tries to pick up his pencil, then picks it up in both hands, but then it drops and rolls out the room],
,Mrs. Puff:, 3 more minutes class.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.
,Mrs. Puff:, 2 more minutes.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, please? This is important.
,SpongeBob:, You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me.
,Squidward:, No no, I didn't. I never said that. ,[Student plays back what Squidward said], I don't need your help, and I don't need you! ,[now talking], Jerk! ,[student shrugs], All right, I said it. But that was before.
,SpongeBob:, Before what?
,Squidward:, Before before.
,Mrs. Puff:, 1 more minute, class.
,Squidward:, Before we were, ,[gulps], boating buddies.
,SpongeBob:, Yay!
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay class, time’s up.
,Squidward:, Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?
,Mrs. Puff:, You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week.
,Squidward:, Next week?
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test. ,[screen cuts to outside], But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school! ,[Squidward screams],

"Narrator:, ""Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff"". This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together.
,Mrs. Puff:, Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts.,[cut to Squidward in a pilot uniform],
,Squidward:, Ripping good day for a spot of driving.
,Mrs. Puff:, And a driver without boat smarts. ,[cut to SpongeBob sliding in on his head upside down, next to Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! ,[wiggles his legs. Squidward gets angry],
,Mrs. Puff:, Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure. ,[cut to Squidward putting air in his tires], Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level. ,[cut to SpongeBob pumping too much air in his tires], While this driver pays no need to boat smarts. ,[tires flips the boat over. Then the tire explodes and blows air into Squidward's face.], Buckling Up. ,[cut to Squidward putting on safety belt], As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision. ,[drives off but stops slowly at a stop light], Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign. ,[cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively without wearing his seat belt and laughing], Now this driver, with no regard for safety.,[Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky steamroller driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but squeezes through the spikes anyways], Well, at least he had his seat belt on. ,[The boat, now cut in half, comes out of the steamroller and in it is Squidward, all injured. His seatbelt pops off.], Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now? ,[Squidward is adjusting his mirrors], You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater. ,[Beeping sound is heard. SpongeBob is running over citizens while he is adjusting his mirrors],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, perfect. ,[moves from behind Squidward in the road and drives in front of him],
,Squidward:, Hey, use your mirrors, fool!
,SpongeBob:, Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. ,[adjusts it to where the light in the reflection blinds Squidward],
,Squidward:, Ah! Can't see! D'oh! ,[puts on sunglasses and giggles. Screams as he crashes into a brick wall. Footage from live-action Japanese Crash test dummy is showing with Squidward's head replacing the Japanese dummy's head. He slides out of his seat], Ow.
,Mrs. Puff:, Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road. ,[Squidward's eyes turn into a lock but vision the road as well. Cut to SpongeBob eating a Krabby Patty and reading the newspaper while driving], And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety. ,[SpongeBob is shaving himself while driving the wrong way on a one way street. Tom is shaking his fist, Sadie looks at SpongeBob and Fred shaking his fist in the air. He causes a woman to crash into a streetlight pole],
,Sadie:, ,[screams], Jerk!
,SpongeBob:, Hi there!
,Nat:, Help! Lunatic driver! ,[crashes his boat into SpongeBob's but SpongeBob's boat is unharmed and keeps driving.],
,SpongeBob:, How's it going? ,[He causes many drivers to flip their boats over and get in accidents],
,Fish:, ,[all screaming and talking at once], I can't feel my hair. My leg!
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law. ,[SpongeBob's boat slips in some water and spins around and around],
,SpongeBob:, Lalalalalalalalala! Whee! ,[his boat is driving backwards now], Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. ,[Squidward and Mrs. Puff scream. SpongeBob's boat stops on a rock and tilts upward, causing Squidward's boat to fly up into the air then into the pile of boat mobiles that are in the accident. Mrs. Puff blows up to a big puffer fish],
,SpongeBob:, Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts! ,[laughs and drives off, making dust and the low quality video recorder stops],
,Mrs. Puff:, Never mind.

"[an envelope is pushed through SpongeBob's door],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary. ,[throws some popcorn into Gary's mouth], Hm, can't read the return address. ,[tears the envelope open], Maybe this will shed some light. ,[reads the paper. The note has the words in different fonts glued to the paper], Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. BlackJack. ,[end of letter], Cousin BlackJack's out of prison?!
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, That's right, Gary, the cousin BlackJack. The same cousin BlackJack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids. ,[flashback to a younger SpongeBob with a bowtie and blue hat on. He gets his body thrown to a wall, courtesy of BlackJack's brutality],
,Young BlackJack:, ,[laughing], Come on, little man. Let's go a couple of rounds, if you think you're tough.
,Young SpongeBob:, Why should we?
,Young BlackJack:, Because it'll show what a little man you are. ,[spins SpongeBob around and plays with him as a jump rope. End of flashback. SpongeBob looks horrified from that experience],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now. ,[imagines BlackJack as a giant],
,BlackJack:, Hi, SpongeBob. It's been a while. Good to see that you're still a little man. ,[laughs. Picks up SpongeBob and tears him in half then laughs some more],
,SpongeBob:, That brute has my parents. I got to get over there. ,[puts his clothes in a suitcase], Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents. ,[cries and wipes his eyes with a pair of underwear. Cuts to SpongeBob's parents' house where the building has been wrapped around with police tape and plastic], Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? ""Do not cross""? Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed. No! Get it together, SquarePants. To face BlackJack, you've got to be as tough as nails. ,[forces himself inside the house], Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic. The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here? ,[walks forward a little], What's this? BlackJack smashed my family portrait. Oh, no. What has he done with my parents? ,[imagines his parents watching TV],
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Oh, darling, it's so nice to spend quality time with you; what with you in the office all hours of the day. ,[Mr. SquarePants snorts. BlackJack busts down the door and laughs],
,BlackJack:, I got a new outfit for ya. ,[both parents are whimpering],
,SpongeBob:, That fiend. Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note. ,[reads note], SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm going to do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack. ,[end of note], He's going to get Grandma, too. I have to stop him. ,[cut to Grandma's house], Grandma, where are you? Are you okay? Grandma? You in here? Grandma? ,[sees a gingerbread man on a plate], Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp. Oh, that animal. ,[cries],
,Grandma:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?
,Grandma:, Well, if you mean from beyond the kitchen table, yes. You're just in time. I've baked a fresh batch of gingerbread men.
,SpongeBob:, But where's BlackJack?
,Grandma:, Oh, BlackJack just called and left a message for you. He couldn't make it because he's got some loose ends to tie up.
,SpongeBob:, Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?
,Grandma:, And if you don't hurry, you'll miss out on all the fun. ,[SpongeBob imagines his parents being hung over a boiler by BlackJack. He screams as his head bends and an identical head pops up from his mouth], And when it's all done, he'll need help cleaning up the mess.
,SpongeBob:, Cleaning up the mess? ,[his face deflates], I got to get help. I'll go to Uncle Captain Blue's. He'll know what to do. ,[runs to Captain Blue's where he is mowing the yard. SpongeBob jumps on the lawn mower], Uncle Captain Blue, I need your help.
,Uncle Captain Blue:, Well, if it isn't little SpongeBob. Plant a firm one on me, Bobby. ,[shakes SpongeBob's hand, but tears his arm off in the process],
,SpongeBob:, I need you to help me rescue my parents.
,Uncle Captain Blue:, Sure, Little Bobby. I could use some help with the lawn, but you're gonna need this to do the job right. ,[hands back his arm. SpongeBob mows the lawn],
,Narrator:, 346 minutes later...
,SpongeBob:, Uncle Captain Blue, I need to help my parents. They're in danger.
,Uncle Captain Blue:, ,[turns off the mixer], What? You want to build a fence? ,[laughs], The boy came to work.
,SpongeBob:, Actually, I came to try to find my...
,Uncle Captain Blue:, ,[shoves wooden boards, hammers, and nails in SpongeBob's face], And when you're done, I've made a tomato and clam juice smoothie to refresh you. ,[drinks the smoothie out of the mixer], Ah. ,[SpongeBob builds a fence all the way around Uncle Captain Blue's property. over speaker], And how many candles you burning out there? Over. ,[indistinct speech and static], Do you copy? Over? ,[tries turning the knob], Copy? Do you copy?
,SpongeBob:, Uncle Captain Blue, Uncle Captain Blue? Please help me.
,Uncle Captain Blue:, Well, of course you can. ,[SpongeBob cuts off some coral, paints the house, and fixes the boat. When he's done, it's nighttime],
,Narrator:, Much, much, much later...
,SpongeBob:, ,[uses his tongue to crawl to Captain Blue], I am desperately searching for my mommy and daddy!
,Uncle Captain Blue:, Landscaping? Isn't it a little dark out for landscaping? ,[SpongeBob grabs the music player and yanks it out of the wall],
,SpongeBob:, Listen, Uncle Captain Blue. We don't have much time. Cousin BlackJack has my parents help captive at his house.
,Uncle Captain Blue:, They let that dangerous miscreant out of prison? Sounds like your parents are in trouble, kid.
,SpongeBob:, That's why we have to rescue them now!
,Uncle Captain Blue:, Whoa, there, Little Bobby. No can do.
,SpongeBob:, But, Uncle Captain Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you.
,Uncle Captain Blue:, No, no, I don't chase criminals these days. I'm retired, and if I were you, I'd consider turning around and going home. You're not cut out for this kind of work, boy. An innocent kid like you doesn't stand a chance against a criminal mind. Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?
,SpongeBob:, You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?
,Uncle Captain Blue:, Well, let's just say, I hope you've practiced walking without legs, or arms, or a body. But since you insist, I'll drive you all the way over to BlackJack's right now. ,[SpongeBob digs up the concrete with his fingers], Just try to relax until we get there. ,[drives 20 feet and stops], There it is. We're here. ,[SpongeBob gets out], Uh, lock the door behind you, kid. ,[SpongeBob pushes down the lock and Uncle Captain Blue drives back into his house. SpongeBob goes up the steps and then steps on a one that makes noise. A guard worm growls and barks at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy. ,[grabs the door handle to knock, but is tapped on the shoulder by his uncle in a thought cloud],
,Uncle Captain Blue:, Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you? ,[SpongeBob imagines himself knocking on the door and BlackJack grabbing him through the door and using him as dental floss. He screams],
,SpongeBob:, Uncle Captain Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home. ,[Mrs. SquarePants screams], Mother! ,[runs through the door], Mom?
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Help me!
,SpongeBob:, They're trapped in the basement. ,[runs down into the basement], Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here.
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Oh, but if we leave now, we'll miss the party.
,SpongeBob:, Party?
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Oh, why, yes. We're celebrating your cousin BlackJack's release from prison.
,Mr. SquarePants:, Now if your klutzy mother can stop dropping her punch glass like she dropped that picture frame...
,Mrs. SquarePants:, I told you, Harold, that was the fumigator's fault.
,SpongeBob:, The fumigator's? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house?
,Mr. SquarePants:, The only crime that ever happened at our house was the infestation of those worthless krill, but they should be gone by now.
,SpongeBob:, So, you two aren't being tortured by cousin BlackJack?
,Mr. SquarePants:, No, SpongeBob, your cousin BlackJack has paid his debt to society and renounced his criminal ways. Never again will he litter.
,BlackJack:, That's right, little man!
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Oh, well here comes the man of the hour. He's been talking all day about playing with his little cousin again. He mentioned something about jumping rope with like the old days. ,[SpongeBob's eyes break],
,BlackJack:, Did you come here to quiver like a jellyfish, or did you come to wrestle?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whimpering], To quiver! ,[hides his eyes, nose, and mouth inside his head],
,BlackJack:, I always knew you were a little man. Prepare to live your past in the present. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[whimpering], Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time! That's it! I am not gonna take this anymore! I am putting my foot down! You wanna tussle!? Well, let's tussle it up! ,[Cousin BlackJack runs at SpongeBob and hangs onto his leg. He is the size of SpongeBob's foot], Cousin BlackJack?
,BlackJack:, In the living flesh. ,[grunts as he takes off SpongeBob's shoe and punches his big toe],
,SpongeBob:, That tickles.
,BlackJack:, Just like the old days, eh, cousin?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, BlackJack, you haven't changed a bit. ,[everyone laughs],

"[SpongeBob is riding on his horse, and muscular, and is saving a woman tied on the railroad tracks, screaming],
,Woman:, Help!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, yah!
,Woman:, Help, help!
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Hup. ,[horse stops], There, there. You're safe now, little lady. ,[maniacal laughter coming from a man],
,Man:, You fool! You've falled into my trap. Now you're mine, SpongeBob the strong!
,SpongeBob:, So, we meet again, Crazyfish!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Bring it on!
,SpongeBob:, With pleasure!, [cracks his knuckles],
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, ,[grunts], So loud!
,SpongeBob:, You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, You bet your frosting, Sponge-cake.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting. ,[both do a rock-paper-scissors game with SpongeBob winning the first round with paper over rock but Crazyfish changes his rock to scissors], Hey, that's cheating!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, No, it's not.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, it is!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, No, it's not.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, it is!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Is not!
,SpongeBob:, Is too!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Is not!
,SpongeBob:, Is too!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Is not!
,SpongeBob:, Is too! ,[while they argue, the train is getting closer to the woman],
,Woman:, Um, guys?
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Anyway, your shoe’s untied.
,SpongeBob:, Is not!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Is too.
,Woman:, Guys?
,SpongeBob:, Is not!
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Is too.
,Woman:, The train!
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps next to her], Don't worry! I'm ready! ,[tears his shirt], Bring it on! ,[right before the train hits him, his alarm wakes him up from his dream], Oh, good morning, Gare-bear.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch-villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature. ,[puffs out his chest. Goes to the bathroom and has trouble opening up the toothpaste. He deflates to his normal size and goes to get back into his bedroom and he opens a cabinet, rummaging through it, tossing away a sock, a wind-up eyeball toy, a baseball glove, one of his socks, a boot, and an 'I'M WITH STUPID' T-shirt. SpongeBob pulls out a red monkey wrench, and goes back to the bathroom and hits the wrench on the toothpaste, causing the top to ricochet off some things in the bathroom before hitting SpongeBob in the eye. He looks in the mirror to see if he has a black eye], Whew, what a relief. For a second there, I thought I gave myself a black... ,[He accidentally slips on the toothpaste top and hits his eye on the wrench], ...eye. ,[Looks in the mirror at his black eye. Starts crying in bed which startles Gary, he comes up to bed],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing!
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.
,Gary:, ,[disagreeing], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You promise you won't laugh? ,[Gary nods], Okay, here goes. ,[lifts his head off the bed], Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste. ,[Gary restraints from snickering], Thanks for not laughing, Gare. I knew you'd... ,[Gary leaves through his pet door], Gare...? ,[cut to SpongeBob leaving his house with pink sunglasses on. He looks around and sees no one around, so he walks out, but runs into Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob screams], Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh! ,[takes off the sunglasses and sees SpongeBob's black eye], SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did someone hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.
,SpongeBob:, No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson. ,[thinking of the toothpaste],
,Patrick:, Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?
,SpongeBob:, Hmm... ,[thinking of Crazyfish], Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.
,Patrick:, ,[quivering], Oh.
,SpongeBob:, He was big and mean. Oh, but ol' SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners.
,Patrick:, What did you do?
,SpongeBob:, I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.
,Patrick:, With tears?
,SpongeBob:, Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him.
,Patrick:, Then what happened?
,SpongeBob:, I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...
,Patrick:, I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed!
,SpongeBob:, That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy. ,[walks off],
,Patrick:, There goes a real hero.
,SpongeBob:, ,[makes karate sounds], Slugger, that's me. ,[stops a sea cow crossing], What the? ,[Sandy is riding a sea horse and taming the sea cows],
,Sandy:, Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Sandy.
,Sandy:, Whoa! ,[sea horse stops], Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...
,SpongeBob:, Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need 'em. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.
,Sandy:, A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.
,SpongeBob:, Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.
,Sandy:, Why? Did he write it down?
,SpongeBob:, No, I engraved it on his pain gland.
,Sandy:, Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!
,Sandy:, Jack M. Crazyfish?
,SpongeBob:, It all happened late last night... ,[flashback to last night where SpongeBob is walking down the road], I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head. ,[Crazyfish laughs after throwing the tire], Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps. ,[Crazyfish walks away crying], He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.
,Sandy:, So how'd you get the black eye then?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner. ,[watch beeps],
,Sandy:, Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios! ,[cut to Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty! I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident. ,[SpongeBob kicks the doors open and looks around trying to look tough], Well, looks like I was right about the accident part. ,[SpongeBob walks up to a fish and shows the black eye he got],
,Harold:, Oh!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking. ,[walks up to a table of two fish],
,Fish #2:, Do you mind? We're trying to have a decent meal here.
,SpongeBob:, That's right. ,[SpongeBob walks up to Squidward. Clears his throat],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I'm...
,SpongeBob:, Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just gonna stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it. ,[takes the microphone], All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, gramma! ,[old lady puts down the mustard], Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.
,Squidward:, Not really.
,SpongeBob:, All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma?
,Squidward:, It was me, I said it. ,[SpongeBob turns around and hisses at Squidward, who recoils from the sight of the gruesome black eye],
,SpongeBob:, Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who. ,[flashback to this morning], It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum. ,[lady screams],
,Harold:, Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.
,Mr. Krabs:, He's right.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet. ,[lady continues to scream while tied to a railroad track], ""Don't worry, I'll save you."" I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak. ,[slow howl... thud], And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears. ,[he cries], The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face... ,[one of the tears bounces off a rock and hits SpongeBob in the eye], ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!
,Dale:, Uh, what did you say he looked like again?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...
,Dale:, Little green hat?
,SpongeBob:, I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat? ,[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward gasp], He's... real...
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, I'm looking for SpongeBob Squ--
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.
,Gramma:, I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby. ,[SpongeBob runs home],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Gary. ,[runs back with toothpaste and wrench], All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this... ,[hits the toothpaste with the wrench], Then I was walkin', like this. ,[walks over to the toothpaste top], And I didn't see where the cap went, like this. ,[slips on the top and hits himself in the eye with the wrench], So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this. ,[points to his left eye], Uh... like these. ,[points to both eyes being black], So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?
,Jack M. Crazyfish:, Uh, not really. I'm here because I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty. ,[cut to SpongeBob bringing a plate with a Krabby Patty with six patties on it to Crazyfish],
,SpongeBob:, One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord. Served directly to your waiting ,[slips and throws the patty into Crazyfish's face], Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.
,Jack M.Crazyfish:, Where I’m from, sorry don’t cut it. We settle things in a different kind of way. ,[play a game of rock-paper-scissors like before with SpongeBob holding out paper while Crazyfish holds out a rock, but changes it to scissors],
,SpongeBob:, Noooooooo!

,Patrick:, ♪Makin' it clean, and livin' a dream. Makin' a scene, I'm makin' it clean, I'm makin' it clean. I'm makin' it clean!♪
,SpongeBob:, Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?
,Patrick:, ‘Cause I'm expecting some very important company.
,SpongeBob:, Who's that?
,Patrick:, My big sister, Sam!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!
,Patrick:, ,[The music stops abruptly as Patrick drops the mop and starts to look sad.], Nobody does. ,[gets choked up], I lost her in the surf when we were kids.
,SpongeBob:, Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my...,[sniffles], my...,[sniffles], my... rock! ,[Patrick bursts into tears, sobbing in despair.],
,SpongeBob:, It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!
,Patrick:, Thanks, man, you're right. I can't wait to make up for our lost years!
,Squidward:, ,[opens window], Would you two pipe down!
,Patrick:, Sorry, I was getting my place ready for my sister.
,Squidward:, Well, I hope she's not as obnoxious as you. ,[Bus rides up],
,Sam:, ,[punches door open and walks towards Patrick thunderously],
,Squidward:, ,[closes window fast],
,Patrick:, ...Sam!
,Sam:, ,[Grabs Patrick by the neck and breathes in his face], Brubber!
,Patrick:, Sis!
,Sam:, ,[Starts hugging Patrick very tightly],
,Patrick:, It's so good to see you.
,Sam:, You. Sister Sam. Have much catch up to do. ,[accidentally catapults Patrick into his rock],
,Patrick:, Wow, you pack a wallop, sis. Sam, this is my best friend, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way. ,[Both giggling], Yeah long way, heh heh, go back.
,Sam:, ,[eyes bug out], Yellow square touch brubber! Make sister Sam mad! ,[chucks SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, I cleaned my rock just for you. ,[Both walk away],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Plummets and falls face-flat on the ground],
,Patrick:, Let’s go inside and play.
,Sam:, House too small. Make bigger. ,[pushes rock],
,Patrick:, Hey, great idea! I'll just go and get some tools and-
,Sam:, No.
,Patrick:, Huh?
,Sam:, I have tools right here. ,[takes out briefcase and pours out a bunch of sand. Starts making a sand rock],
,Squidward:, Oh, dear Neptune. Didn't you hear me- ,[face is pummeled with sand],
,Sam:, ,[Walks over sand rock and takes the tv antenna off of Patrick's rock. Puts antenna on sand rock],
,Patrick:, Thanks, sis!
,Sam:, Sister Sam loves to make rock for brubber.
,Squidward:, Well, make rock some where else. My house is full of sand.
,Sam:, If big nose no like sand, big nose move! ,[pushes Squidward's house away],
,Squidward:, This is way beyond my property line. Hey, Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister! ,[laughs], Construction humor.
,Sam:, ,[growls], No laughing!
,SpongeBob:, No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Oh, I mean it, alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier.
,Sam:, ,[huffing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[scared], Oh, Squidward, you jokester.
,Sam:, ,[more huffing],
,Squidward:, Do you think she looks a little... miffed?
,Sam:, ,[huffing angrily, then starts crying], Those boys mean! They pick on sister Sam!
,Patrick:, Shame on you two! Look what you've done!
,Squidward:, Look what ,we've, done?!
,Sam:, ,[crying so hard that her tears fling Squidward and SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, ,[falls face first in the sand],
,SpongeBob:, ,[flies onto a seahorse-shoe toss pole],
,Tuck:, Golly-doo-diddley, Clem, that was a nice toss.
,Clem:, Wasn't me, Tuck. My money's on the little missie over yonder.
,Patrick:, Awwww, hey, sis, don't listen to those... meanies. Hey, the new rock is looking kinda... boring. What do you say we decorate it?
,Sam:, Blecorate?
,Patrick:, You can call it whatever you like, sis, as long as we make it spiffy!
,Squidward:, ,[empties sand out of head],
,Sam:, Make new house spiffy. ,[takes window off of Squidward's house], Spiffy!
,Squidward:, Hey, you can't do that, that's my window!
,Sam:, ,[puts window on the antenna on the sand rock and laughs], Blecorate.
,Patrick:, That's the spirit, Sis.
,Squidward:, Oh no. That is definitely ,not, the spirit, Patrick. Your sister is out of control!
,Patrick:, Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!
,Squidward:, You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it! ,[takes off the antennae-window],
,Sam:, ,[dismantles more part from Squidward's house and puts it on the sand rock], More spiffy!
,Squidward:, But that's from... ,[looks at his somewhat horribly dismantled house], My house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!
,Patrick:, How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things...
,SpongeBob:, Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?
,Patrick:, No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well! ,[cries],
,SpongeBob:, It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-
,Sam:, Shush! Meanies make brubber's eyes water! ,[grabs SpongeBob and Squidward], Meanies go home! ,[Throws them to their homes],
,Patrick:, Come on, sis. They won't bother us under our rock.
,Sam:, Meanies is mean. ,[sand rock closes],.
,Squidward:, ,[Walks out of his ruined house, gets angry and starts carrying a heavy rock],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.
,Squidward:, The time for talk is over! Now is the time for action! ,[walks onto sand rock and holds his rock menacingly over his head], A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the... ,[grunts], tides of time!
,SpongeBob:, I don't think you should do that.
,Squidward:, Who cares what you think?! If it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get! ,[throws rock, but it bounces off and demolishes the pieces of Squidward’s house on the sand rock. Sand rock opens, flinging Squidward in the air],
,Sam:, Who makes noise? ,[sees the broken pieces. screams], Spiffy broken! ,[Squidward falls], Sister mad!
,SpongeBob:, Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.
,Sam:, ,[picks up broken pieces], Sister Sam rearrange now!
,SpongeBob:, Please don't.
,Sam:, ,[chews up pieces and rapidly spits it out at Squidward's house. Squidward's house then collapses as Squidward looks at it in disbelief],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward? ,[Squidward is gone], Huh? Must be getting started.
,Squidward:, ,[driving bulldozer toward the sand rock. Laughing maniacally],
,Patrick and Sam:, ,[shocked], Huh?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward, Squidward stop! ,[jumps on the bulldozer], Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?
,Squidward:, Oh, you mean like this? ,[revs up accelerator, knocking SpongeBob off], Sweeeet destruction!
,Sam:, ,[stops the bulldozer. drops Squidward out of the bulldozer and chucks it at SpongeBob's house, destroying it], That'll teach those meanies.  
,Patrick:, Your still my rock big, sis.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?
,SpongeBob:, She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
,Patrick:, Well, I guess she can get a little carried away.
,Sam:, What Patrick doing? Why Patrick talk to meanies?
,Patrick:, Well uh...well...well it's about your temper, Sam.
,Sam:, No have temper! That make sister Sam SO mad! Sister Sam put on mean face! ,[turns face around with an angrier face], Now smash brubber's house! ,[picks up the sand rock],
,Patrick:, Not the rock! ,[jumps on the sand rock while Sam pummels it],
,Sam:, ,[slams the ground and yells. Her regular face then sees Patrick hurt and unconscious], Patrick? Little Brubber? Little Brubber no wake.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick? ,[takes out cookie dough],
,Patrick:, ,[sniffs it and eats it as he wakes up], Cookie Dough!
,Sam:, Patrick Ok! Sister Sam feel bad. Sorry she hurt Patrick. Should protect little brubber. She go now. ,[walks away],
,Patrick:, Sis, wait! Hold on! Aw, don't feel sad. You don't have go!
,Sam:, Yes, Sister Sam must go. Late for manicure. ,[hugs Patrick tightly again], Bye, brubber!
,Patrick:, Bye, sis.
,Sam:, ,[bus drives up and she punches another hole, but next to the door],
,[The bus leaves.],
,Patrick:, Isn't my sister something?
,SpongeBob:, Aw, she's something, all right! ,[laughs],

"[It's another great day in Bikini Bottom. Gary is out in a clearing and SpongeBob tiptoes over to a rock behind him giggling. He looks from behind it],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I've got ya now, Gary.
,Gary:, Meow? ,[SpongeBob jumps up and lands in mid-air. He touches Gary's shell with his index finger],
,SpongeBob:, Tag, you're it! ,[he runs off, SpongeBob jumps and he opens his mouth. He flies to his house and chomps down on the side of it, leaving him clinging. garbled], Gary will never find me here! ,[Gary crawls over the ground, up the house and toward SpongeBob], Uh-oh. ,[Gary's eye substitutes as an arm as he tags SpongeBob and meows], Tag! Now I'm it! ,[he laughs uncontrollably as he slides down the wall, scraping off two slices of the covering with his teeth. Patrick is below and SpongeBob takes the shavings out of his teeth],
,Patrick:, Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Gary and I are playing tag, you wanna join us?
,Patrick:, Oh boy, would I!
,SpongeBob:, ,[slyly], Okay, ,[touches him], Tag, you're it! ,[walks away],
,Patrick:, I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it! ,[Gary is still there, and he meows. Patrick tags him], Tag, you're it! I win, I win! ,[Gary purrs and rubs against Patrick. Then he crawls all around Patrick's body. SpongeBob walks over], What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], It tickles! ,[the two laugh endlessly as Gary continues to crawl around. They continue laughing and laughing until it's dark],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. ,[he pulls Gary off of Patrick and walks away], Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay. ,[Patrick waves], What about you, Gary? ,[SpongeBob sees that he's no longer holding Gary], Gary? Gary? ,[cut to Patrick's house where the rock is up and Patrick's brushing his teeth and looking in a mirror on the side of the wall. He has his nightcap on],
,Patrick:, ,[singing], Brush brush brush, brush brush brush… ,[SpongeBob walks over],
,SpongeBob:, Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?
,Patrick:, ,[singing], Brush brush brush, ,[he brushes under his armpit], Brushin' everywhere… ,[he spits and turns around. We see Gary attached to his stomach], Nope. ,[looks down], Oh, hey, here he is! ,[Gary purrs and meows],
,SpongeBob:, Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep.
,Patrick:, Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that's a great idea!
,Patrick:, A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games… ,[SpongeBob thinks to himself and we hear Patrick in the background saying, ""Blah blah blah blah…""],
,SpongeBob:, ,Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover.,
,Patrick:, And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books…
,SpongeBob:, OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. ,[they wave good-bye and SpongeBob walks home],
,Patrick:, Blah blah blah blah blah… ,[soon, night becomes day and SpongeBob wakes up to his foghorn alarm clock],
,SpongeBob:, I'm awake!
,Patrick:, ,[off-screen], Hey, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob leaps up and runs to the window. Patrick and Gary are outside],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?
,Patrick:, Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows! ,[he pulls Gary off his chest and runs. Gary goes after him as he runs around SpongeBob's house. He runs on top of his house and falls off and continues running, which Gary then imitates], See? ,[SpongeBob jumps from the window and runs off],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee! ,[laughs], Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me? ,[he notices he's not being chased], You're not chasing me… ,[Gary is still with Patrick],
,Patrick:, Come on, Gary, let's play a different game. ,[he and Gary walk away. SpongeBob jumps in front of Gary],
,SpongeBob:, Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of… ,[Gary crawls away after Patrick], …you… What's wrong with me? ,[he sniffs his armpit], Do I offend? ,[Patrick is playing with Gary, Gary is crawling on Patrick's toes. Patrick's on his back and laughing while Gary purrs. SpongeBob runs inside the house and brings out a ball covered in snail slime], Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball! ,[Gary is sitting on Patrick's bum and Patrick shakes it, laughing. SpongeBob drops the ball. Gary is now crawling up to Patrick's armpit. SpongeBob pulls a can of snail nip], Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip! ,[he eats some], Huh? Huh-huh? ,[Gary is too busy crawling on Patrick's head to notice. SpongeBob decides to try something else, he runs inside and hangs from the window by his head], Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head! ,[Gary is on his shell rolling Patrick left and right], All right, that's it! ,[The window opens and SpongeBob falls. Gary is now rolling on Patrick's belly. SpongeBob walks up to them], Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now. ,[Gary's eyes lower], Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant! ,[SpongeBob struggles and pulls Gary off Patrick], Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary. ,[he walks off, Gary lets out a meow of sadness],
,Patrick:, Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!
,SpongeBob:, What's that supposed to mean?
,Patrick:, I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose. ,[SpongeBob does so],
,SpongeBob:, Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary! ,[Gary turns around to Patrick], Uh, wrong way, Gary. ,[Ignoring, Gary is crawling toward Patrick], G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary! ,[he collapses as Gary crawls up to Patrick],
,Patrick:, Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question. ,[SpongeBob's eyes well up], So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.
,SpongeBob:, ,[angrily, to Gary], Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me… ,[whimpers], ...for all that I've done?! ,[Patrick's rock falls down into place. Cut to SpongeBob's darkened room where SpongeBob is on his bed looking down at Gary's bowl. He sheds a tear into it], I guess you're not coming back, Gary. ,[angrily], I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend! ,[cut to Patrick running around laughing with Gary on his head. SpongeBob walks by with a giant worm by the leash. The worm is bluish green and is panting heavily], Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex! ,[Rex barks, SpongeBob pats him], Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit! ,[he waits, but Rex is just sitting there], Roll over, Rex, roll over! ,[Rex just sits there again], Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? ,[Patrick laughs and dances with Gary on his head], I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me. ,[loudly so Gary can hear], So loyal, so trusting, always by my side! ,[Rex barks and we see he's waiting for the bus across the street with a hitch-hiking hole with stuff in it. The bus comes and he rides off. Cut to SpongeBob entering the house with a pet carrying case], Who needs worms anyway? ,[SpongeBob puts down the case and opens the door], Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy. ,[a snail comes out. It's got big bushy black eyebrows and a tan shell, with the same design as Gary's], You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.
,Lary:, ,[in a deeper voice than Gary's], Meow. ,[Cut to Lary sitting at a table as SpongeBob walks over with a plate with a cover on it. SpongeBob is in chef garb],
,SpongeBob:, And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da. ,[he takes off the cover, it's snail food in Gary's bowl. But the Gary inscription now has an L written over the G], Bon appetite, Lary. ,[giggles. Lary sniffs it and hisses. SpongeBob quickly takes the bowl away, scared], Okay, maybe later. ,[walks backward. Cut to SpongeBob with his robe on, showing Lary the newspaper bed next to his own], This is where you sleep, Lary. ,[Lary goes over on it, hisses, and tears it up. Lary is now up on SpongeBob's bed], Uh, that's where I… ,[Lary hisses loudly and falls asleep instantly], I guess you can sleep there… ,[SpongeBob lays down on the shredded newspaper], I'll just sleep down here. ,[lays some shreds on him like a blanket], Well, good night, Lary. ,[Lary hisses again. Cut to morning where Lary is watching TV. SpongeBob jumps in upside down and surprises him, causing him to hide in his shell], Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one! ,[clears throat], What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor! ,[laughs, Lary hisses and crawls away], Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor. ,[he deflates then he stands up], Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry. ,[he holds a real-life snail from his pocket. He looks at a photo of Gary], Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?! ,[cries], Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why, why?! ,[we hear Gary meow], Gary? ,[we see Patrick and Gary are behind him. Patrick is holding a basket of laundry],
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hello, Patrick.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Gary.
,Patrick:, Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?
,SpongeBob:, Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…
,Patrick:, And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?
,SpongeBob:, Soap? But… we used to use soap. ,[holds up two bottles], Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'… ,[tears up],
,Patrick:, Here it comes…
,SpongeBob:, Du… du… duuuuu… ,[cries], ttyyyyy! ,[his tears make both of the bottles bubble up], Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you! ,[stops crying], I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want. ,[runs up to the sofa and tears it up furiously], If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up! ,[runs up to the litter box], And the litter box? Forget about it! ,[he dumps the litter on his head], The world is your litter box! ,[he runs to the fridge and opens it], And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access! ,[he takes a milk carton and drinks it], And you don't even have to use a bowl! ,[he runs to a giant carving of Squidward], And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward. ,[scratches at it], Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary? ,[we see SpongeBob has carved Squidward into a heart],
,Patrick:, How pathetic…
,SpongeBob:, Gary…? ,[the heart breaks in half and one half hits him. The two walk to the laundry room],
,Patrick:, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself. ,[he takes off his shorts and puts them in the machine; Gary crawls in after them], It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary? ,[the two notice Gary is in the machine, nudging in Patrick's shorts], He only liked me for my shorts!
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket! ,[Gary is indeed eating the cookie. He finishes and crawls out up to SpongeBob],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, G-G-Gary? ,[Gary burps and happily meows], Whee! ,[he hugs Gary], Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww… ,[giggles, he takes his leash], Let's go for a walk, pal! ,[the two walk out.],
,Patrick:, Gary? I thought what we had was special...!

,SpongeBob:, I didn't get a license, Patrick.

,Patrick:, No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
,SpongeBob:, Let's just go home, Patrick.
,Patrick:, We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.

,Patrick:, The horn works. ,[scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road], Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
,Patrick:, Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
,SpongeBob:, Two millionth?
,Patrick:, Then you can get a free boat just like me.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, just like you.
,Patrick:, I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
,SpongeBob:, Can we go home now? ,[zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over], We've been driving around your house for hours.
,Patrick:, I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
,SpongeBob:, Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
,Patrick:, No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. ,[shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you doing?
,Patrick:, I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. ,[SpongeBob groans and slam his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am],
,SpongeBob:, 4:00? ,[yawns. Doorbell rings], Who could be at the door at this hou— ,[falls down the stairs. Opens the door], Now what is it, Patrick?
,Patrick:, You will never guess what happen to me today.
,SpongeBob:, You got your license.
,Patrick:, Yeah! ,[shows his license], But that's not all.
,SpongeBob:, You got a new boat.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets back into bed], Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. ,[foghorn alarm blows],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. ,[scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work], I'm so tired. ,[horn honks],
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. ,[tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab],
,Patrick:, Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks for the ride.
,Patrick:, No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. ,[SpongeBob is getting very angry],
,SpongeBob:, That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
,SpongeBob:, When did we get a drive-thru?
,Mr. Krabs:, I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
,SpongeBob:, I used to have a dream.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
,SpongeBob:, ,[through headphones], Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— ,[""La Cucaracha"" horn honks],
,Patrick:, The horn still works. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform], Hey, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, What's with the helmet, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. ,[clicks tongue],
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh. ,[scene cuts to Patrick driving],
,Patrick:, Boy, driving is so easy.
,SpongeBob:, Oh?
,Patrick:, Do you want me to give you lessons?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sarcastic], Oh, that would be great.
,Patrick:, Oh! ,[drives over to SpongeBob's parents],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
,Mr. SquarePants:, Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?
,Patrick:, What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
,Mrs. SquarePants:, That's great, Patrick.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
,SpongeBob:, Mom!
,Patrick:, Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
,SpongeBob:, Hey. ,[Patrick drives off],
,Mr. SquarePants:, Even Patrick has a license. ,[both parents sigh],
,Patrick:, Let's see what this baby can do. ,[steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH'],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
,Patrick:, Yeah, yeah.
,SpongeBob:, ,[reads the speedometer], 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. ,[car stops next to a policeman],
,Patrick:, What? Where? Who?
,SpongeBob:, Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
,Officer:, Umm... okay. ,[uses radar gun. It reads 0mph], Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. ,[drives off],
,SpongeBob:, Are you sure you don't want to run him in? ,[scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red], It's a red light, Patrick! ,[Patrick runs through red lights], Patrick, you just ran three red lights!
,Patrick:, So?
,SpongeBob:, You're suppose to stop!
,Patrick:, I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.
,SpongeBob:, ,[finally snaps], Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
,Patrick:, They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
,SpongeBob:, I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
,Patrick:, How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
,SpongeBob:, If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
,Patrick:, I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! ,[takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises],
,SpongeBob:, ,[fixes his face and then snatches Patrick's license out of his hand],Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! ,[tears up Patrick's license then laughs. The pieces of the license fly into the cop’s hands],
,Officer:, Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. ,[drives off after SpongeBob & Patrick],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, It's the police!
,Officer:, ,[over speaker], Pull it over, litterbug!
,Patrick:, Litterbug?! No! ,[drives faster],
,Officer:, Ooh, I got me a runner. ,[a bunch of police cars are following him],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
,Patrick:, I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. ,[drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom],
,Judge:, 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
,Patrick:, So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
,SpongeBob:, What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! ,[runs up to the judge], Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
,Judge:, Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! ,[a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail],
,Narrator:, One debt to society later... ,[door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! ,[both hug],
,SpongeBob:, I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. ,[shows him a license plate that reads ""PALS 4 EVER""], Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
,Patrick:, Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Patrick:, It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, then what do we do with this? ,[Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind],
,Patrick:, How's that?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah!
,Patrick:, Ready, buddy?
,SpongeBob:, Ready, pal. ,[hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises], Woo! Woo!

,Mr. Krabs:, Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall.
,[Squidward interrupts],
,Squidward:, Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.
,Mr. Krabs:, And why is that, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Because then you'd only get to repair it once.
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both blink],
,SpongeBob:, So, what flavor is it?
,Mr. Krabs:, It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.
,SpongeBob:, No, I mean the toothpaste!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh. Well I think it's... ,[Mr. Krabs notices the toothpaste drip, the wall cracks, and falls down],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium sized hole in the wall!

,Mr. Krabs:, Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!
,[Cuts to Mr. Krabs outside looking through the hole],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?
,SpongeBob:, I got this new microphone system which everybody hears them, The sign with a menu on it, and a colorful arrow from the Krusty Krab. It even lights up, see? ,[Light goes on],
,Mr. Krabs:, OK, but, I got something better. A menu made with napkins and tape, A microphone system made of tin cans, and this sign... I made it from an old noodle.
,SpongeBob:, I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than I bought?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm sorry, what?

,Frankie Billy:, It's for my dry cleaning. It's seems as though your new drive-through window is a little on the challenge side. Size-wise, I mean.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Crashed the drive-through window with a mallet], There we go, problem solved. ,[Folded arms smiling],
,Narrator:, Meanwhile...

,Dale:, Excuse me, I like to place an order. ,[Squidward walks],

,[Now totally feeling rejected and hurt, SpongeBob goes outside in the cold, rainy night with Gary and sleeps on the driveway while holding an umbrella.

,Coupe:, Mr. SquarePants, I can drive you to work. Why are you walking?

,SpongeBob:, Well, sure, Patrick. Hop in.

,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Butt on buttons!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Patrick, I don't think Coupe likes that.
,Coupe:, ,[grabs Patrick and sits him down], Passenger, settle down. ,[smacks Patrick's face with the seatbelt and fastens him, making his pop chocolate ice cream out from his bellybutton],

,Patrick:, Oh, don't worry. It's down there somewhere. Ahh. ,[puts ice cream on his tongue and resumes pushing various buttons with his ice cream-covered hands],
,Coupe:, ,[groans and spits in disgust while Patrick plays with the buttons], Ugh, eww! All right, that's enough! ,[ejects Patrick out of the passenger seat],
,Patrick:, Thanks for the ride!
,[Coupe stops at the Krusty Krab.],
,SpongeBob:, Here we are.
,Coupe:, Here we are, where?
,SpongeBob:, Where I work, the Krusty Krab.
,Coupe:, What? I can't be seen here. I'm a classy car. This place is tacky. ,[the chimney makes a flatulence sound],
,SpongeBob:, ,[struggles to unhook the seatbelt and open the door, but to no avail], Coupe, open the door! I'll be late! ,[Coupe drives away], Yow! But I have to go to work! Ah. ,[sulks into his driver seat],
,Coupe:, You obviously have no taste, so today we're going to do what I want to do.
,SpongeBob:, But I have to go to work. ,[groans],

,SpongeBob:, I have to go to work.
,[Coupe is now at the garage getting itself waxed, its engine repaired, and its wheel pumped up.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[growing impatient], But I have to go to work!
,[Coupe gets its finger nails on its robot hand filed, its wheels massaged and is offered a glass of oil. One of the mechanics gives SpongeBob the bill.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[looks at the bill and pays the mechanic], Ugh. I have to go—
,Coupe:, Go to work?
,SpongeBob:, No, go to the bathroom.
,Coupe:, You can hold it.
,SpongeBob:, Or I could just go. ,[unzips his pants and Coupe unhooks the seatbelt in disgust],
,Coupe:, Ugh. Make it snappy. ,[slaps SpongeBob with the seatbelt],
,SpongeBob:, Ow! ,[groans],
,[SpongeBob heads out of the garage. But unbeknownst to him, Coupe's headlights turn red and starts scanning like a security camera.],
,Coupe:, Hmm? Hmm. ,[sees SpongeBob going into the parts store and buying something there], Hmm. ,[becomes angry], Hmm.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks out of the store with a bag and sees Coupe spying on him], Eh? ,[hides the bag and whistles back into the garage; he goes to the driver seat, but Coupe drive away a few inches], Hmm. ,[stammers as he tries again, but Coupe drives away again; Coupe drives out of the garage and onto the street], Very funny, Coupe. Very funny.
,Coupe:, What's in the bag?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, nothing. ,[Coupe drives away], Hey, wait! ,[jumps into the driver seat],
,Coupe:, What are you doing, SquarePants?
,SpongeBob:, I'm going to work. ,[pulls out a steering wheel from his bag and jams it onto the control panel; then he jams an accelerator on the bottom and places a bobble-head on the windshield; he floors it and takes control of Coupe by turning it around],
,Coupe:, Ooh.
,SpongeBob:, Did that hurt?
,Coupe:, Of course not. I'm a boat. I don't feel physical pain.
,SpongeBob:, Good to know, ,[puts on a helmet], because I'm a stunt driver, and I'm making donuts!
,[SpongeBob spins Coupe around in circles and crashes into a fence.],
,Coupe:, Oh, no you don't. Give me that! ,[grabs the steering wheel and turns around],

,Coupe:, ,[laughs], Now this is where I should be living! ,[drives into the elevator], Penthouse parking lot, please. ,[the bellhop pushes the button on the elevator], Thank you.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, how are you doing today? Good? ,[whistles],
,[The elevator reaches the penthouse parking lot on the rooftop. The penthouse parking lot consists of a bed, a gasoline pump, a smoker, palm trees, a stove, a radio stereo, and a pool.],
,SpongeBob:, Well played, Coupe.
,Coupe:, ,[shakes hands with SpongeBob], Indeed. ,[giggles],
,SpongeBob:, Because now we can get to the Krusty Krab the fast way! ,[steers Coupe off the roof],
,Coupe:, What? No! No! Noooo! ,[lands near the Krusty Krab], No, you don't! ,[SpongeBob tries to break free, but Coupe ties him up with the seatbelt], No, no, we're not going into the tacky Krusty Krab!
,SpongeBob:, You're right, we're going through the drive-thru! ,[steers Coupe through the drive-thru with his tongue], Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, please. ,[strains as Coupe drives to the drive-thru window; Squidward gives SpongeBob his order while SpongeBob keeps fighting with Coupe], Squidward, you see me struggling with this boat, and you act like you don't care!
,Squidward:, It's not an act. ,[closes the drive-thru window as Coupe drives away from the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out his Triple Krabby Patty with ice cream], I hate to do this to you, Triple Krabby Patty with five scoops of ice cream, but I have no choice. ,[throws the ice cream-filled patty on the control panel],
,Coupe:, No, no, stop! I don't like that! ,[screeches its tires as it drives out of control],
,Patrick:, ,[appears on the road], Hey, SpongeBob!
,Coupe:, Oh, not this idiot again!
,SpongeBob:, Ahhh! ,[Patrick stops Coupe and lifts it up to lick the ice cream from the radiator],
,Patrick:, Ah, I thought I smelled ice cream. ,[licks more ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, My self-driving days are over.
,Coupe:, What do you plan on doing with me, SquarePants?
,SpongeBob:, Eh, I have an idea.
,[The scene changes to Patrick riding on Coupe at the Krusty Krab like a kiddie ride.],
,Patrick:, These self-driving boats are real classy. ,[laughs until Coupe stops moving; Patrick grumbles and throws his ice cream on the hood], It stopped again.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Patrick. ,[gives him a bag of quarters], Here's a whole bag of quarters so you can ride forever.
,Patrick:, Ohh! ,[puts a quarter through the slot and Coupe begins moving again],
,Coupe:, Please, somebody, strip me, sell me for parts! Just put me out of my misery!

"[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the path with an orange balloon. They take a deep breath and hold it until they reach Sandy's treedome. They enter the dome, put on their water helmets, and spit out water for them to breathe. Sandy is welding some contraptions together for her latest invention. SpongeBob taps her shoulder.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Sandy!
,Sandy:, Hey, SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Check out our new balloon.
,Patrick:, Her name is Squeaky. ,[rubs the balloon and squeaks],
,Sandy:, Sorry, guys, I'm working on my new invention. Y'all better come back tomorrow.
,Both:, ,[exclaim], New invention?!
,Sandy:, See?
,[Sandy shows them her new invention as her wheel turns making a colorful vortex.],
,Both:, Ooh.
,SpongeBob:, What is it?
,Sandy:, It's a portal to other worlds. I built it to explore the universe. Also for quick trips to Texas to pick up some of my favorite barbecued nuts. ,[puts her hand through the portal and takes a bag of nuts from a sleeping old man], Yoink!
,Old coot:, Huh? Dagnabbit! That ding-dang, nut-stealing arm is back again!
,[Sandy pulls her arm back from the portal with a bag of nuts and eats some.],
,Sandy:, Pretty nifty, huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[looking at the control panel with Patrick], Yeah. Nifty. Ooh, what's this do? ,[pulls on levers], Vroom, vroom, vroom! ,[screeches and presses some buttons and a rope],
,[Patrick makes beeping sounds as he pushes several buttons. Both SpongeBob and Patrick laugh and continue playing on the control panel.],
,Sandy:, Hold it, don't touch anything. I gotta go grab some 1/16 inch diodes to finish the weld. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you heard Sandy. ,[presses buttons as he talks], We shouldn't touch this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this! ,[pushes buttons with his feet and toes],
,Patrick:, Definitely don't do this, SpongeBob. ,[pushes a lever and pulls another; pushes several buttons with his buttocks], Or..or this! ,[presses more buttons with his buttocks],
,SpongeBob:, And under no circumstances should you ever touch this. ,[pushes red button], Boink.
,[Suddenly, the alarm goes off and the button activates the vortex.],
,Both:, Whoa. ,[stammering],
,Sandy:, ,[comes out of her tree and gasps], Oh, no! You've activated the vortex!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, so swirly.
,Patrick:, Look at all the colors.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely hypnotized by the vortex's swirling colors and begin to walk closer to it like zombies.],
,Sandy:, Whatever you do, don't walk into it!
,Patrick:, Can we skip into it?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick skip up to the vortex.],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, you stop right now! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick stop], Now turn around. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick turn around], Now walk.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick lift their right legs and instead of walking over to Sandy, they walk backwards into the vortex. The vortex closes.],
,Sandy:, ,[gasps], Oh. ,[groans], Those two ain't no smarter than a circus peanut.

There's no escape, Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[sobs], I can't take it! Let me out of here!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically run up, down, left, right, and loop-de-loop in many attempts to escape. But their efforts were no avail. SpongeBob screeches lines across the floor as he bumps into Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick take notice of the lines moving.],
,Both:, Hmm. Huh? ,[the lines crawl away], Ooh!
,[SpongeBob draws another line and it crawls away.],
,SpongeBob:, Mm...,[laughs], Oh, Patrick, watch this! ,[sticks his hand in his head], Boink. ,[pulls out a giant pencil that looked almost like the magic pencil from Frankendoodle. He draws a boatmobile above them. The boat revs up its engine and runs over Patrick, leaving him tire marks on his face.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoops, sorry!
,Patrick:, ,[gets up], Heh, draw some more!
,[SpongeBob draws a door similar to his front door of his house. He opens the door and reveals a living similar to the one at his house.],
,SpongeBob:, Nice décor. ,[closes the door], Hmm. ,[draws a doodle version of his house],
,[SpongeBob then draws a doodle version of Squidward's house and Patrick's house.],
,Patrick:, Oh, my house! ,[jumps and hugs his doodle house until suddenly, all three houses are being lifted in the air], Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah! Hey!
,SpongeBob:, Oops, forgot to draw the ground. ,[draws a flat line for the ground],
,[The three doodle houses drop back down, crushing Patrick under one. Patrick pulls himself out and his stomach rumbles.],
,Patrick:, Ahh.

,SpongeBob:, No problem. ,[draws the Krusty Krab work hat], Two patties coming right up! ,[draws a doodle Krabby Patty], Your doodle patty, sir. ,[draws himself a doodle Krabby Patty],
,[They both eat the doodle patties, however, they tasted horrible.],
,Patrick:, ,[spits it out], Tastes weird.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, they are a little dry. ,[his doodle patty and doodle hat crumble to dust],
,Patrick:, I miss real Krabby Patties!
,SpongeBob:, I miss Mr. Krabs.

,SpongeBob:, Aww, isn't he cute?
,Patrick:, How do you do?
,[DoodleBob babbles and jumps onto Patrick. Patrick hugs DoodleBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, I'm next on the hug list.
,[DoodleBob disappears.],
,Patrick:, Oh, oh! He disappeared! ,[reappears in Patrick's belly], Oh, why was a cursed with the hug of death? Why?!
,SpongeBob:, He's not gone, Patrick. He's right there on your tum-tum.
,[DoodleBob multiplies into numerous mini DoodleBobs. They all scramble on Patrick's belly, which at first resulted in tickling him. Then, without warning, they all start biting him like mosquitoes.],
,Patrick:, Get 'em off! Get 'em off me, SpongeBob! ,[the mini DoodleBobs continue biting him],
,SpongeBob:, Hold on, Patrick! ,[draws a hose and sprays water on Patrick to wash the DoodleBobs off; leaving him a hole in his stomach],
,Patrick:, Oh, thanks, buddy.
,SpongeBob:, You're welcome. ,[gets up], I guess we need to be more careful.
,[DoodleBob comes back to life in the puddle and comes out in a much taller form. He takes the pencil and draws two angry eyebrows on his face. He quickly turns over to SpongeBob and Patrick with the pencil, scaring them out of their wits. DoodleBob babbles.],
,SpongeBob:, Nice DoodleBob. Put the pencil down.
,[DoodleBob draws an anvil and it falls on top of SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,Patrick:, Oh, run!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick run away from DoodleBob. DoodleBob draws a tank over them. SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a piano and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a safe and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. SpongeBob and Patrick continue to run with DoodleBob in hot pursuit.],
,Patrick:, What are we gonna do, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes off his left shoe and sharpens it into a pencil point], We'll have to fight doodle with doodle. ,[draws three doodle versions of Mr. Krabs, Gary, and Squidward], Hold it right there. You're no match for my doodle squad! ,[Doodle Squidward, Doodle Gary, and Doodle Mr. Krabs come to life], Attack!
,[The three doodles run over to fight DoodleBob. But DoodleBob grabs Doodle Squidward and whacks Doodle Mr. Krabs and Doodle Gary. Then he draws angry eyebrows and mustaches on all three of them, making them evil. All three doodles turn against SpongeBob and Patrick and go to attack them.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, run! ,[Doodle Gary jumps on SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, Ooh! ,[Doodle Mr. Krabs pinches Patrick with his claws],
,[Doodle Squidward kicks SpongeBob and Patrick in the faces. All three doodles run away and DoodleBob babbles.],

,Patrick:, ,[being held by DoodleBob], Over here.
,SpongeBob:, Yipe! You let him go, Doodle!
,[DoodleBob draws rope around Patrick. He babbles as he looms the pencil over SpongeBob. Then he draws a grave and a tombstone. He draws a coffin around SpongeBob and pushes him into the grave, burying him. DoodleBob drags Patrick and runs away with him. SpongeBob pops out from the grave.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,[SpongeBob draws a telescope and sees DoodleBob in his drawn castle tying his prisoner, Patrick, to a flagpole.],

,[DoodleBob laughs and launches Patrick with the catapult.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], I gotcha! I gotcha!
,[Patrick crashes into SpongeBob.],
,Both:, Oof!
,[DoodleBob then draws stamper and creates a whole army of DoodleBobs. They run out from the castle to attack SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run.],
,Patrick:, What are we gonna do?
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes off his shoe and draws a line], In here.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick hide as DoodleBob and his army run past them. SpongeBob and Patrick come out.],
,SpongeBob:, Phew.
,Patrick:, ,[loudly], Nah-nah, you missed us! ,[through megaphone], Now you gotta kiss us!

,Patrick:, Nah-nah...
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, What? ,[gasps],
,[DoodleBob babbles as SpongeBob and Patrick cry and hug each other.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, we'll never get back home!
,Patrick:, We'll never see our balloon Squeaky again!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squeaky! ,[gasps], Squeaky! ,[takes off his show and draws a balloon], Grab on, buddy!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick grab onto the balloon's string and they float away. DoodleBob attempts to grab them.],
,SpongeBob:, Too slow, DoodleBob!
,[DoodleBob babbles.],
,Patrick:, Uh, SpongeBob.
,[DoodleBob commands his army to connect with each other to make him high enough to reach SpongeBob and Patrick. Once they reach them, DoodleBob grabs the balloon's string. SpongeBob takes off his shoe and draws some scissors.],
,SpongeBob:, Here, Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[grabs the scissors], Oh, ooh, uh... snip! ,[cuts the string and he and SpongeBob fall down],
,[DoodleBob and his army float far away with the balloon until they are out of sight.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's the end of DoodleBob.
,Patrick:, But we're still stuck here.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah. Too bad Sandy isn't here. She'd find a way to get us back home. ,[gets an idea], Wait a minute, Patrick! ,[takes off his shoe and draws a doodle version of Sandy], Doodle us home, Sandy.
,[Doodle Sandy takes SpongeBob's shoe and draws a vortex.],
,Doodle Sandy:, Bleeble blobble blortex!
,Both:, Yay! Thanks, Sandy!
,Patrick:, Whoo!
,SpongeBob:, Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

,[SpongeBob and Patrick return home through the vortex, much to Sandy's shocking surprise.],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, we're back!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick dry up. They take deep breathes and put their water helmets on.],
,Sandy:, I ain't fixed the vortex yet! How in tarnation did you get back?
,SpongeBob:, Sandy saved us. ,[he and Patrick leave],

But when he breathes, he notices something was wrong with his mouth. He smacks his lips and opens his mouth. Inside, his tongue is all dried up and a family of hillbilly germs move away because they're home has no water. SpongeBob realizes that he is thirsty, so he gets out of bed to get a drink of water. He walks downstairs and into the living room.],

Patrick has his bucket on his head. SpongeBob looks at the screen. It says, ""The end"" again] ,Oh, no, we missed the movie.
,Patrick:, What?! Not again!
,SpongeBob: ,It's okay, we'll just see the next one.
,Cinema Anglerfish:, I'm afraid not. That was the last showing.
,SpongeBob:, Wow. Uh, what time is it?
,Cinema Anglerfish:, ,It is, ,one minute to midnight.,
,SpongeBob:, One... minute... to midnight?! ,[he and Patrick get out of their seats],
,Patrick:, But that's when the Fisherman comes out! ,[he and SpongeBob run out of the room],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, , ,[scream] The Fisherman! [they have ran into a cardboard cutout of the Fisherman with the title of the movie beside it. They run out of the Reef Cinemas screaming], '',[the clock tolls, meaning that it's midnight. A little cardboard cutout of the Fisherman comes out of the clock and lowers his cardboard hook and catches a cardboard fish. It goes back in the clock] ,It's midnight! The Fisherman!, [run to SpongeBob's door]
,SpongeBob:, Phew. We made it.
,Patrick:, I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.
,SpongeBob: ,Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.
,Patrick:, It's like we're heroes.
,SpongeBob: ,Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.
,Patrick:, Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?
,SpongeBob:, No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door. ,[starts walking Patrick to his door],
,Patrick:, Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead? ,[foghorn blows], Do you hear that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispering], I think it's coming from over there. ,[points to fog. A shadow comes behind it],
,SpongeBob & Patrick: ,It's the Fisherman! ,[scream and hide behind Patrick's rock; Slasher McGee passes by on a small bike with training wheels],
,SpongeBob: ,Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there. ,[tries to move but doesn't] ,Just a few steps that away. ,[tries again but fails] ,In the dark? All alone?
,Patrick: ,Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home. ,[starts walking SpongeBob home],
,SpongeBob: ,Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?
,Patrick: ,Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it. ,[a shadow comes over them. Behind the fog there is a shadow of the Fisherman] ,
,SpongeBob and Patrick: ,The Fisherman! ,[scream but then notice that the shadow is actually of jellyfish who had formed a shadow of the Fisherman. SpongeBob and Patrick continue screaming. Squidward wakes up and growls. He gets out of bed. SpongeBob and Patrick run around screaming but stop and pant],
,Squidward: ,What is wrong with you?!, ,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and jump to Squidward's windows. They shiver],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Squidward.
,Squidward: ,What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!
,Patrick:, We can't get home.
,SpongeBob: ,We're too scared. ,[Squidward growls. Scene changes to Squidward walking to Patrick's rock with SpongeBob on his head wearing his nightcap and Patrick holding onto him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs] ,Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend. ,[Squidward opens Patrick's rock with his  left foot and throws Patrick in],
,Patrick:, Thanks, Squidwar... ,[Squidward closes his rock and grumbles. He walks over to SpongeBob's house],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you.
,Squidward: ,Hat.
,SpongeBob: ,Oh, yeah. Here. [gives Squidward's nightcap back. Squidward pulls SpongeBob's legs, which shoots him through his mail slot and into his bed]
,Squidward:, I told those muttonheads not to see that movie. [walks into his house]
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Are you okay?
,Patrick: ,Yeah! Are you okay?
,SpongeBob: ,I think so! Good night!
,Patrick: ,Yeah., good night! Just don't think about the Fisherman!
,SpongeBob: ,Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!
,Squidward: ,Oh, ""The Fisherman."" ""The Fisherman."" Blah, blah, blah. They want a Fisherman, eh? I'll give them a Fisherman! And how! ,[goes to his closet and turns on the light. He pulls out a vampire costume], No. ,[pulls out a Frankenstein costume], No. ,[pulls out an Easter Bunny costume], Um... no. ,[pulls out a fisherman's hat and coat], Aha! ,[lightning strikes. Squidward is outside and has the coat on], It's time for those lame-brains to meet the ,real, Fisherman. ,[puts on the hat with a beard attached to it. Lightning strikes again as Squidward lowers the hook from the fishing rod], This is gonna be good. ,[laughs. Lightning strikes again. Squidward is in a boat on the roof of his house his hook at Patrick's rock, scrapes it, and opens it a little four times. Patrick wakes up and opens his rock with his head],
,Patrick:, Uh, hello? Someone there? ,[the hook hooks under his left nostril] ,Uh, uh? What's that? ,[stammers] ,There's something stuck... ,[grunts] ,Huh. ,[the hook starts pulling it] ,Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left. ,[drools] ,Oh, yeah. All right. Right there. ,[laughs. Squidward laughs and pulls the hook],
,Squidward: ,Gotcha! ,[the hook pulls Patrick out of his rock],
,Patrick: ,[screams as he sees Squidward] ,The Fisherman! ,[screams and runs],
,Squidward: ,Maybe this wasn't such a good idea., [the rod goes after Patrick and starts to pull Squidward and the boat with it; Squidward screams; the boat rides up Patrick's open rock and soars in the air. Patrick screams twice while Squidward starts laughing. He runs to SpongeBob's house, pulls his door open, goes inside, and closes the door causing Squidward to smash into the door. Patrick sees Squidward outside, laughing. Patrick runs, with his face ripped off from the hook, he runs up to SpongeBob's bedroom], SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!
,SpongeBob:, Who's here? Hold on, let me get up. ,[scream], Your face!
,Patrick: ,Oh. ,[takes his head and stretches it, making his face whole again], There.
,SpongeBob:, Now who's here?
,Patrick:, Uh, someone's here?
,SpongeBob:, You just said.
,Patrick: ,Oh. The Fisherman's here.
,SpongeBob:, The Fisherman!
,Patrick: ,The Fisherman!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[scream and run in circles on SpongeBob's bed],
,Squidward:, Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But I'm having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.
,SpongeBob:, Quick. Block the door.
,Squidward: ,There's just no sport in it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob & Patrick push stuff over to SpongeBob bedroom door], Get everything?
,Patrick:, What about this? (Patrick holds Gary)
,SpongeBob: ,Not Gary. Think it'll hold?
,Patrick: ,I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)
,SpongeBob & Patrick: ,(scream as Squidward opens the window and then scream again)
,Patrick:, Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.
,SpongeBob,: Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)
,Squidward: ,I'm the Deadly Fisherman!
,SpongeBob & Patrick: , ,(scream),
,SpongeBob:, I guess this is the end, old buddy.
,Patrick: ,I don't want to die in my underwear!
,SpongeBob: ,Here. ,(SpongeBob takes off his underwear), Die in mine.
,Patrick: ,Hey. Good idea. Let's trade. ,(Patrick takes off his underwear), Here you go.
,SpongeBob:, And here you go. ,(SpongeBob and Patrick trade underwears and puts on their underwears), Now where were we? Oh, yeah.
,SpongeBob & Patrick: ,[screams], He's gonna turn us into fish sticks!
,Squidward:, ,[laughing],
,SpongeBob & Patrick: , ,(scream),
,SpongeBob: ,That thing's eating Squidward!
,Patrick:, Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, with 33. I need you to go long. You're going down, Fisherman!
,SpongeBob: ,Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window. (Patrick throws heavy objects onto Squidward) Okay! I think you got it! ,[Sirens sound], ,[Squidward grumbles], Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, there, there, no need to thank us. We were only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that old monster anymore.
,Squidward: ,Huh?
,SpongeBob & Patrick: ,(scream and run into ambulance) (Costume falls down, revealing Gary)
,Gary: ,Meow. (Episode ends)

"[The episode begins at a local circus. A giant jellyfish and an elephant snail are performing in the center ring. The elephant snail makes its loud trumpet roar, spitting saliva onto SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, I heart the circus! ,[laughs],
,Ringmaster:, Children of all ages! Get ready to wet your baggy pants laughing! Send in the clowns! ,[grabs his assistant and uses him like a whip], He-yah!

,Ringmaster:, He-yah! Don't feed the clowns!
,SpongeBob:, ,[melts in his body], Why not?
,Patrick:, Huh? ,[pulls SpongeBob together], SpongeBob, are you mad? Clowns are dangerous animals. Why, at any moment, one of those things could get loose and bite our feet off! ,[pulls off his feet],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick, that little clown wouldn't do that. He was friendly.
,[The little clown waves at the audience until he notices his clown friends climbing back into their car. The little clown pushes the bigger clown in the car and follows them in. The car crashes into a pole and the clowns fall out unconscious. An ambulance drives into the ring. Two paramedics come out with a stretcher. SpongeBob and Patrick biting their nails in worry. The paramedics carry the clowns to the ambulance. The little clown climb on to the top, takes out a flower and pretends to die. Then wakes up and waves to the audience. The audience laughs.],

,[The tall clown takes his foot and pushes the little clown, sending him flying to the ding bell.],
,SpongeBob:, Poor little guy.
,[The ringmaster dumps candy in a bin and whistles for the clowns. The clowns run up and eat the candy like animals. The little clown wants to eat some, but couldn't get in between the bigger clowns. The big clowns walk away, leaving the little clown with no food.],

The little clown is now lost and alone. The scene changes to SpongeBob dragging a bag of popcorn the next morning.],
,SpongeBob:, I don't care what that mean old ringmaster says. That clown is hungry, and I'm gonna feed him. ,[sees cotton candy flying everywhere, but the circus is not there], Hey, where'd the circus go? Now I'll never find that little clown.

,[The little clown shakes his head, saying ""no.""],
,SpongeBob:, You don't want to be a circus clown?
,[The little clown holds out a circus pennant and eats it. He then waves his hand in front of his face and makes his frown into a smile.],
,SpongeBob:, You know, little clown, I don't blame you. You shouldn't stay in a place where they push you around all the time. Looks like I'll have to help you find a new job. But what else can you do?

,SpongeBob:, Oh, you want to work there? ,[the little clown nods his head, saying ""yes.""], This job should be a snap, little clown.

,SpongeBob:, I think you'll get a job a lot quicker if we tone down the whole clown thing a smidge. Don't worry. When I get through with you, your own ringmaster won't recognize you.
,[Several balloon animals pop on the screen. SpongeBob shaves the little clown's hair. He turns the little clown's pants strap into a tie. He puts a tuxedo on the little clown and replaces the clown's shoes with regular shoes. SpongeBob smooches himself and shows the little clown his new look. SpongeBob puts one more detail on the clown: a mustache. The little clown is happy and claps. The scene changes to a department building.],

,SpongeBob:, ,[teary-eyed], Aww. ,[sheds a tear and leaves],
,[The little clown continues stamping the papers. He then stamps the papers with his feet. Then he stamps ink all over his face. He stamps his face onto the papers.

,Mrs. Puff:, ,[sticks herself out the window], Save me! Save me! I'm too young to broil!

,Squidward:, Please, don't do that.
,SpongeBob:, What's the part two?
,Squidward:, Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? ,[SpongeBob takes out a list],
,SpongeBob:, Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.
,Squidward:, Great. Uh, let me see it. ,[looks at the list],
,SpongeBob:, The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.
,Squidward:, Everything's in red.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I know.
,Squidward:, We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
,SpongeBob:, Then let's roll! ,[both walk out], Bye, Mr. Krabs. ,[Mr. Krabs cries and puts a ""Help Wanted"" sign in the window], Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.
,Squidward:, Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.
,SpongeBob:, Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. ,[cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to a businessman], Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. ,[cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to some kids], Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. ,[one of the kids throws a rock at Squidward's head.

,Squidward:, Hey, Frank. ,[montage ends], Glad that's over.
,SpongeBob:, Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity.
,Squidward:, Which is...?
,SpongeBob:, I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
,Squidward:, You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], That's a good one Squidward! ,[cut to Squidward in a salmon suit in front of some kids. All the kids throw rocks at him. Cut to SpongeBob checking off the item on his list], Next. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward sit by a rock], Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.
,Squidward:, Who's there?
,SpongeBob:, I am! ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, ,[laughs weakly], Oh, yeah... ,[SpongeBob checks the knock-knock jokes off his list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking backwards],
,SpongeBob:, ,[imitates the beeping of a back up alarm], Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! ,[continues beeping. SpongeBob checks off this item off the list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward making noises with their tongues out of their mouths while moving their hands back and forth in front of their face. SpongeBob checks the item off his list. Cut to Squidward walking with SpongeBob as his face],
,SpongeBob:, Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.
,Squidward:,  [,muffled,] I can't breathe. ,[SpongeBob checks that off his list. Cut to SpongeBob performing open-heart surgery on Squidward],
,Squidward:, Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
,SpongeBob:, Who's the doctor here? ,[heart squirts blood. SpongeBob checks his operation off the list as well as some other items while he laughs], The last thing on the list is...
,Squidward:, ,[with a bandage over his heart], Does it involve more dismemberment?
,SpongeBob:, Watch the sunset with Squidward.
,Squidward:, Sunset? ,[thinks about what Mr. Krabs said earlier in a thought balloon],
,Mr. Krabs:, The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. ,[Mr. Krabs cries and runs off], Okay, see you later.
,Squidward:, C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, ,[a brick wall is shown between the two], ...and this brick wall that you built between us.
,Squidward:, Yeah. ,[laughs nervously],
,SpongeBob:, Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? ,[Squidward imagines SpongeBob exploding],
,Squidward:, Explosions... I mean, erosion. 
,SpongeBob:, You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. ,[Squidward tears up. SpongeBob burps], Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. ,[smells the aroma], Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? ,[the sun starts to go down], Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.
,Squidward:, Four... three... two... one... ,[nothing happens],
,SpongeBob:, I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
,Squidward:, Five... four... three... ,[an explosion is heard from behind the wall], two... ,[cries], o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful. ,[he sighs], I am such a good person. ,[another explosion is seen behind the wall but this time, it knocks the brick wall down on top of Squidward. SpongeBob is blowing some bomb-shaped bubbles],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, check this out! ,[Squidward gets up and mutters], Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.
,Squidward:, Why are you still here?!
,SpongeBob:, Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. ,[holds up a book that says ""Friends 4 Ever""], I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.
,Squidward:, ,[slaps book away], Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to ,explode,!
,SpongeBob:, You want me to explode?
,Squidward:, Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
,SpongeBob:, Um, okay, I'll try. ,[grunts and then yells], GARY! YOU ARE GONNA FINISH YOUR DESSERT, AND YOU ARE GONNA LIKE IT!, ,[laughs], Now it's your turn!
,Squidward:, ,[yells and stomps on the ground], ,THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT YOU BARNACLE HEAD!,
,SpongeBob:, Oh, good one.
,Squidward:, No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces! ,[he flaps his arms],
,SpongeBob:, Why would I do that?
,Squidward:, Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
,SpongeBob:, What pie?
,Squidward:, The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... ,that pie!,
,SpongeBob:, Pie...pie... ,[takes out a pie], Oh, you mean ,this, pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! ,[walks forward and trips on a rock], Oops! ,[pie flies into Squidward's face in slow-motion causing an explosion the size of an atomic bomb, which is a clip of test Baker, just offshore from Bikini Island],

,Fish:, Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky! ,[fish looks up and notices SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crashing into the truck],
,Mrs. Puff:, Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still... ,[a squad car smashes down on the boat mobile. The other squad cars fall on and around the truck. The truck falls over on its side as all the fruit punch comes pouring out],
,Feminine Tom:, ,[inside the retirement home], Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes. ,[when the window is opened, the fruit punch pours in. Scene cuts to Fred, who is mopping the hallway and listening to ""Surfin' Summer"" by the Beach Boys on his headphones. The fruit punch fills the hallway, drains, and Fred is still mopping the same spot. Scene cut to an elderly fish man, who is writing on some paper],
,Elderly Fish:, Oh, it's finally finished! A memoir of my life, written in red ink. ,[red punch comes flowing in, making his memoir papers soggy and red], Aww, barnacles! ,[scene cuts back to outside where all the mess is],
,Mrs. Puff:, Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay?
,SpongeBob:, That depends, did I pass?
,Officer Nancy:, Freeze, you're under arrest!
,Mrs. Puff:, Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver!
,Officer Nancy:, We're not talking about him. ,[scene cuts to Mrs. Puff wearing a prison uniform, being locked up in jail],
,Mrs. Puff:, But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake!
,Prisoner 1:, Yeah, I don't belong here, either!
,Prisoner 2:, Me too! I'm innocent!
,Prisoner 3:, ,[yelling in a butch Southern drawl], I belong here! ,[this triggers some other prisoners to complain about their not belonging here too. Puff walks over and sits down on the bed],
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay, you can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah! ,[laughs then jumps to the floor], In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes.

,SpongeBob:, Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. ,[scene cuts to Mrs. Puff with a happy expression],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[hums while breaking rocks. Scene cuts to her making license plates], ♪Smelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.♪ ,[scene cuts to her lifting weights], ♪Haaapiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!♪ ,[cuts back to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. ,[scene cuts to the outside of Patrick's rock],
,Patrick:, Well, it sounds like it's all your fault.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! ,[Patrick takes one of his dots and puts it in the place of where his nose would be if he had one], Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail.
,Patrick:, How are we gonna do that? ,[scene cuts to the First Nautical Bank],
,SpongeBob:, Alright, put the money in the bag! ,[SpongeBob is in the bank, wearing a sock over his head, with a bag in his hands, facing the wrong way. He yells], Put it in!
,Bank Teller:, Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around then laughs. Yells again], ,Alright, give me the money!,
,Bank Teller:, Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, savings.
,Bank Teller:, May I please see some identification?
,SpongeBob:, Sure. ,[takes out a card and gives it to the bank teller], Here ya go.
,Bank Teller:, Thank you. ,[SpongeBob's Jellyfishers Club Membership card is shown. As the bank teller types on the cash register, SpongeBob lifts up the sock on his head and gives Patrick a thumbs up], Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts.
,SpongeBob:, Oh.
,Bank Teller:, Next! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the bank],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that went better than expected.
,Patrick:, Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! ,[SpongeBob's eyes rip through the sock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick disguised as yellow and pink rocks],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. ,[a truck full of rocks drives up],
,Fish:, Hey, there's a couple. ,[gets out and throws the two rocks in the truck],
,Guard:, Put your back in it, girls! ,[women prisoners are crushing rocks outside. The truck arrives and unloads more rocks],
,SpongeBob:, Look, Patrick, there she is! ,[both jump over to Mrs. Puff where she is about to hit them], Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!
,Mrs. Puff:, That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like...
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. ,[Mrs. Puff screams as she throws the pickaxe behind her], We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! ,[Mrs. Puff starts shaking],
,Mrs. Puff:, It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?! ,[one of the guards walks up, with Mrs. Puff's pickaxe in his head],
,Guard #1:, Alright, Mrs. Puff, it seems like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty.
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes, it must be the heat. Yes. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. ,[a woman prisoner walks over], No, wait! ,[she smashes the two rocks into pieces], There goes our deposit on these costumes. ,[scene cuts to lunchtime where Mrs. Puff is serving chili to the prisoners.],
,Mrs. Puff:, There you are. ,[A woman, with a deep voice, walks up to Mrs. Puff],
,Woman:, Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub?
,Mrs. Puff:, Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some. ,[scoops up SpongeBob's nose],
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!
,Mrs. Puff:, When are these horrific hallucinations going to end? ,[SpongeBob gets out of the chili],
,SpongeBob:, No, it's really me! ,[pulls Patrick up out of the chili], I brought Patrick along too.
,Patrick:, Hi.
,Mrs. Puff:, Why?
,SpongeBob:, 'Cause we're gonna set you free!
,Mrs. Puff:, No, I mean, why'd you bring him? ,[Patrick eats some chili],
,SpongeBob:, He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. ,[makes a rectangle-shaped entrance in the chili],
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, I am not going with you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I think she means it.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's crazy, Patrick.
,Mrs. Puff:, He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying.
,SpongeBob:, But why?
,Mrs. Puff:, I like it here. These are my people! ,[cut to a shot of some angry, gruff looking woman prisoners], And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou... ,[we see SpongeBob sad. He is sniffling as a single teardrop falls from his eye], ...uranium! In the water supply. ,[she whips out a glass of water], See? Crystal clear! ,[she guzzles the water and tosses away the glass], Aahhhh!
,SpongeBob:, Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff. ,[to Patrick], Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. ,[scene cuts to Frankie Billy in traffic then at his desk at work and then staring out his bedroom window],
,Frankie's wife:, Coming to bed, honey?
,Frankie Billy:, Yes, dear. ,[scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom.
,Mrs. Puff:, For the last time, no! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick disappear inside the chili as a guard walks up], I'm not going with you! That's final! ,[notices the guard], Oh. ,[laughs nervously],
,Guard #1:, Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you. ,[Mrs. Puff walks off sad. SpongeBob and Patrick watch her. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff burning coal into wire hangers until SpongeBob and Patrick come down the conveyor belt],
,SpongeBob:, Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!
,Mrs. Puff:, Guards! Guards, come quick. ,[The guards run over to her], There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out!
,Guard #1:, That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest. ,[Grunts as he pushes the level down, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick, which fills the room with steam. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff brushing her teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick come up from the toilet],
,SpongeBob:, Psst! ,[Mrs. Puff screams], Hop in, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, Guards! Guards, come look! ,[guard runs over and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the toilet],
,Guard #1:, Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job. ,[The guard flushes the toilet. Cuts to Mrs. Puff in her bed. SpongeBob and Patrick peek from the top bunk],
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, up here.
,Mrs. Puff:, Guards, guards! They're back! ,[two guards walk up],
,Guard #1:, What's all the hubbub, Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, They're back! ,[guards remove their heads showing them as SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Mrs. Puff, it's us! ,[both wink and give her a thumbs up],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[screams and cries as the real two guards run up],
,Guard #1:, What the barnacle is going on?
,Mrs. Puff:, Get away from me! Get away!
,Guard #1:, What are you talking about, Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili. ,[rips off the guards' faces leaving their skulls shown],
,Guard #1:, Let's face it, Puff, you've gone off the deep end. ,[scene cuts to the guards throwing Mrs. Puff, who is in a straitjacket, in a small square room], Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement! ,[slams the door, which makes a squeaking sound],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room.
,SpongeBob:, Made of sponge! ,[laughs. The room is made of yellow sponge as SpongeBob's face appears on all sides of the wall. Mrs. Puff screams as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air with the police behind them.], I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! ,[The boat crashes into the truck full of punch, knocking it over, and spilling again],
,Officer Malley:, Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk. ,[police officers walk over],
,Mrs. Puff:, No! What? ,[policemen grab SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, No! What are you doing? Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! ,[They throw him into the back of the police car then drive off],
,Mrs. Puff:, I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail!
,Officer Malley:, Why would you go to jail? You already did your time. ,[zoom out to reveal Mrs. Puff wearing prison striped clothes with a ball chained to her ankle. She screams as the scene goes back to her screaming while the boat is in mid-air],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, it's just my imagination again. ,[zooms over to show Donna driving the boat],
,Donna:, So what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama? Chili? ,[Mrs. Puff screams again as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air],
,Mrs. Puff:, Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it.

I'm sinking! ,[spits out tar], Well, I guess this is the end, SquarePants. But like the old saying goes, ""Better to end up sinking into a prehistoric lake of tar, then to turn to a life of crime!""

,SpongeBob:, ,[Runs for boating school], I made it! And a minute before the final bell. I am home free. ,[Tries walking through the door, but ends up running into Mrs. Puff], Mrs. Puff... I'm really sorry! Please forgive me! I don't know what happened! Everything just got away from me! ,[Holds up bathroom key], I brought back your bathroom key, though!
,Mrs. Puff:, I haven't the foggiest idea what you're going on about, SpongeBob, but I don't have time for it. I've got my own problems. ,[Two police officers show up behind her, and cuff her], Johnny Law finally caught up to me for ditching jury duty. Let this be a lesson to you, son...never ditch!

,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, thanks. I'm gonna see what SpongeBob's doing. ,[Goes to kitchen], Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob is shuddering under his table], SpongeBob? What are you doing under the table?
,SpongeBob:, If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law?
,Mr. Krabs:, There's an old saying, lad. What doesn't kill ya... usually succeeds in the second attempt.
,SpongeBob:, But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties?
,Mr. Krabs:, Nothing! But if don't get out there and start cooking, I'll make ya start taking weekends off!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs from the table], Nooooooo!
,Plankton:, ,[spying on Mr. Krabs], So, Mr. Krabs is operating under the table, huh? Well, two can play at that game!
,[cut to the phone in the library. A hook attached to a rope is thrown onto the phone and Plankton climbs onto it],

,Miss Priss:, You missed one!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Ms. Gristlepuss! I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties. But do you really have to send us to jail?
,Miss Priss:, Of course I do! You are a nuisance to my community!

,Miss Priss:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Your shoe's untied!
,Miss Priss:, It is? ,[trips], Oh! ,[falls down to the ground. The Krabby Patty flies from Al's hand],
,Al:, ,[slow-motion], Oooooohhh... ,[in slow-motion, the Krabby Patty falls into Miss Priss's mouth. She chews and swallows it as Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Al stare at her. She then opens her mouth],

,SpongeBob:, Hey heroes! Is there anything we can do? ,[bubble transition to where SpongeBob and Patrick are pushing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy while they grunt and get tired], So is that it?
,Barnacle Boy:, Yes. Thank you boys we don’t usually do this but in term for pushing the invisiboat of those hills. There’s something I'd like you to see, but you must promise to not touch anything.

,Barnacle Boy:, Well don't be. ,[pops the Dirty Bubble with a needle],
,Mermaid Man:, And as long as no one touches anything there's nothing here to be scared of.
,SpongeBob 1:, Understood.
,Barnacle Boy:, And this is our time machine. This device allows us to transport into the future or past at a date or destination of our choosing.
,SpongeBob 1 and Patrick 1:, Ooo!
,Barnacle Boy:, Unfortunately, the consequences of altering the order of history are so dangerous; we chose it to leave it alone so you mustn’t touch...

,Young Mermaid Man:, Sorry, Man Ray. But by stolward companion Barnacle Boy and I beg to differ with you.
,Young Barnacle Boy:, You've tangled with the wrong end of the fishhook of justice, Man Ray.
,Young Mermaid Man:, Now prepare for a heavening help with quick dry tartar sauce.
,Mermaid Man:, Wow our bodies are so tight.
,Barnacle Boy:, What went wrong?
,Young Barnacle Boy:, ,[Man Ray screams], Jumpin' Jellyfish, what happened to the tartar sauce?

,Barnacle Boy:, When are we going to have those two classified as villains?
,Mermaid Man:, They left us here! What are we going to do? I’m sure it’ll all work out.
,Young Mermaid Man:, Don’t worry Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are always here to help the elderly. There’s something familiar about these two Barnacle Boy... I just can’t remember. I just can’t put my flipper on it.
,Young Barnacle Boy:, Hey neat hat!
,Barnacle Boy:, Thanks I... uh... ,[Man Ray laughs wickedly],

,Patrick 1:, Well That Oughta Teach Him To Jaywalk.
,SpongeBob 1:, I uh Patrick do you notice anything different about our prison.
,Patrick 1:, Sorry I couldn’t hear you over the clatter of prison chains.
,SpongeBob 1:, I said is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back.
,Patrick 1:, No. But yes! Just look at the giant medicine billboard! It’s missing a bolt on the bottom right corner!
,SpongeBob 1:, Even worse than that Patrick. The police got new uniforms!
,Patrick 1:, Oh no! What did they do with those old ones?!
,SpongeBob 1:, Ah ye! What happened to the Krusty Krab?! ,[Reads the sign], The designed area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars? The city under life, tradity, and all this.
,Patrick 1:, I’m out of Man Ray dollars?
,SpongeBob 1:, No Patrick it means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past well, in this reality Man Ray is ruler. Oh we got to do something.
,Patrick 1:, For what?

,SpongeBob 1:, Mermaid Man is wearing a hairnet! What happened? Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon not combating the evils of Man Ray?
,Mermaid Man:, I lost a desire and enough physique to fight long ago kid. Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when you’re my age.
,SpongeBob 1:, What about the younger ""Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy""? Surely they refuse to surrender without a fight.
,Mermaid Man:, You got spaghetti for brain's kid? We are the younger ones. The older ones ,[is about to cry], lost our souls and buried in this very restaurant. ,[cries], ,[Older MM and BB graves shown],

,Barnacle Boy:, I hate to break up the memorial service but we’re out of tartar sauce out here.
,Mermaid Man:, Tartar Sauce?! The topping that destroyed life as we knew it! If only my tartar sauce attack hadn’t failed that day, we wouldn’t be living in this wasteland! We’re already out?
,Patrick 1:, Yep. It’s chewy that’s... ,[Burps],
,Mermaid Man:, I knew I recognized you from somewhere and you ate that tartar sauce on that day! You realized what you’ve done?!
,SpongeBob 1:, Sorry Mermaid Man we didn’t mean to destroy your lives you held dear. What do we say to try to make things right? With your help of course.
,Mermaid Man:, I’m not teaming up with you to do jack diddly squat! Besides, Man Ray had to buy the neck! O-E! Evil.
,SpongeBob 1:, Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?
,Mermaid Man :, Barnacle... No! It means he put the electrical collar on me that won’t allow me to leave the restaurant!
,SpongeBob 1:, Oh, let’s get the nasty thing off of you.
,Mermaid Man:, Haven't you two idiots have done enough damage already??
,SpongeBob 1:, I can’t get a good grip on it! I must need a better angle. Sorry sorry. Hey, Patrick can you give me a hand on here?
,Mermaid Man:, Keep away from me! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick grunting],
,SpongeBob 1:, ,[Mermaid Man gets a bump on his head], Ta-daaa! You're free! Now can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the new universe?

,Second Man Ray:, Uh! I got to sit down and think this through.
,Young Mermaid Man:, ,[chains the Second Man Ray], Gotta! You’ve got plenty of time for thinking in the stony lonesome.
,Second Man Ray:, I’m sorry, did you say something? I’m still trying to comprehend what just happened here.

,SpongeBob:, ,[Wipes ingredients off of the counter and lays down the spatula. Panting. Puts his ear up to the spatula], No pulse. ,[Does CPR using two fingers], We're losing him! Hang in there, buddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Looking into the kitchen from his office door], What's all the ruckus?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Using a defibrillator], Clear! Clear!
,Mr. Krabs:, Pull yourself together, boy. So your spatula snapped. Go get yourself a new one!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Looking at broken handle that Mr. Krabs is holding. Dramatic music plays], I'll never forget you.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Slaps SpongeBob away], Quit that, boy. It's creepy. Spatulas can't talk. ,[Walking back to his office], And if I catch yous talking to your next one, I'll lock you up in a padded kitchen. 
,[Scene cuts to Harvey's Spatula Emporium],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Just like clockwork. The twerp approaches. ,[SpongeBob whistling], Time for phase three. ,[Boosts up with jet pack and leaves the store. Flies into one of SpongeBob's pores and flies back out another, landing face down on the ground. Groans and mumbles],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Plankton! ,[Picks Plankton up], What brings you to Harvey's Spatula Emporium?
,Plankton:, Oh, just picking up one of these. ,[Holds up red circular object], Not that you'd know what it is.
,SpongeBob:, Well, judging from its diameter and vermillion color, I am looking at the handle cap for a vintage Grill Force 700 Spatula.
,Plankton:, Wow! A fellow spatula enthusiast, I see. You're right, SpongeBob. But with a few modifications, it'll serve as the end-cap for my SizzleMaster.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I've never even heard of that model.
,Plankton:, Well, there is only one. And some say it has magical grilling powers.
,SpongeBob:, Wow! I must know more.
,Plankton:, Well, you could come over and check it out.
,SpongeBob:, That sounds thrilling! But I do need to hurry back to work.
,Plankton:, ,[Knocking on SpongeBob], SpongeBob, it's a magical spatula with a legend. This is a one-in-a-lifetime experience. ,[Jumps onto SpongeBob's hat], Onward to the Chum Bucket! ,[laughs], Hey, it's this way, kid. ,[SpongeBob's legs rotate and he walks the other direction],
,[At the Chum Bucket. Plankton and SpongeBob are standing at the doorway of the spatula room],
,Plankton:, Feast your absorbent eyes on this! ,[claps twice], 
,[Spatulas are seen everywhere, lining up and down against the walls],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Wow. This is the greatest spatula collection on the whole sea floor.
,Plankton:, These are nothing compared to...,[claps 3 times. Spotlight turns on and spatula rises in a container],...the majestic SizzleMaster! ,[SpongeBob sings in a heavenly choir voice and draws the outline of the spatula with his hand],
,Plankton:, Yes, SpongeBob. I believe the SizzleMaster has found its fry cook in you! ,[Kicks glass cover off of the spatula. Glass shatters], The legend of the SizzleMaster has been fulfilled. ,[Gives the spatula to SpongeBob], And since you are its fry cook, it will reduce your workload tenfold!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that rhymes. Almost. 
,[SpongeBob walks out of the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, Yes, a legend has been fulfilled today. Go forth, SpongeBob. Wouldn't want you to miss the lunch rush. ,[Now talking more sinisterly], Or as I like to call it, ""Phase 4.""
,Karen:, Phase 4? ,[Rolls up next to Plankton], How many phases are there in this convoluted plan?
,Plankton:, Enough, my sarcastic wife. Enough to gain SpongeBob's trust, then steal the Krabby Patty formula right from under his dumb yellow nose! ,[Now standing at a control panel. Laughs], Now to tune in SpongeBoob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding new spatula], I'm back, Mr. Krabs. Did I miss anything?
,Mr. Krabs:, You're gonna be missing a job if you don't get in that kitchen. The lunch rush is nigh! 
,[Plankton laughs while he is listening in from the Chum Bucket.],
,SpongeBob:, These orders have really piled up. ,[Holding pile of orders with larger piles behind him],
,Squidward:, And don't forget these. ,[Dumps more orders over SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Swipes away the orders in the air], Well, nothing me and the SizzleMaster can't handle.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], That's right, SpongeBob! Let's show this lunch rush what for!
,SpongeBob:, Hmm. I must be hearing things, 'cause Mr. Krabs says spatulas can't talk.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Well, I can! The mystical SizzleMaster can do all!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs said he'd put me in a padded kitchen if he caught me talking to you.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[startled], I wasn't talking to my spatula!
,Squidward:, I don't care if you were. The customers are about to snap! 
,[Customer looking very mad and crooks his head appears in the following scene.],
,SpongeBob:, Time to focus. ,[flips patty],
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], You know, SpongeBob, there's a much faster way to do this.
,SpongeBob:, Oh? ,[The spatula goes under one patty and expands out to under 4 patties, then flips], Wow, pretty good. But we're a long, long way from filling all these orders.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Hey Sponge, I know a way to double our productivity. I'll handle things here at the grill, alone, while you man the condiments, huh?
,SpongeBob:, Hey! That's a great idea! But you man the condiments, I'll take the grill. Sorry, but I don't trust anyone with this baby, but me.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Drat!
,Nat:, Hey, Squid guy! Where's my lunch? ,[Grabs onto the register],
,Squidward:, Stay back, you ravenous brutes. Oh!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Puts plate of Krabby Patties on Squidward's head making his hat fall off], Orders, ahoy! ,[Squidward places patties on customers plates],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, SizzleMaster, you truly are magical. We're catching up. But we got an empty grill here.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Leave it to me, kid. ,[SizzleMaster opens the freezer, gets patties, and tosses them on the grill],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, good night, boyo. Headin' home. Thanks for all the extra greenbacks you earned me today. ,[Holding sack of money],
,SpongeBob:, Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. ,[Cleaning spatula], Thank my new magic talking spatula.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, that's great SpongeBob. ,[walking away, then quickly stops], Wait a minute. What did I tell ya about talking to spatulas? Only do it if it makes me money. ,[chuckles],
,SpongeBob:, Well, you can really do wonders, SizzleMaster. Today was great. ,[Hangs SizzleMaster on spatula rack],
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], It sure was, SpongeBob. And maybe tomorrow I can even handle the grill for you, huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Unlikely. But a spatula can dream. See you tomorrow.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Dang it! I need SpongeBob to trust me behind that grill for this plan to work. Hmm. Oh! Hey SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Yes?
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], How about you take me back to your place tonight? I mean, I could help you around the house.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm not going to be grilling tonight, but thank you.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Oh, I am so much more than a patty flipper.
,Plankton:, ,[Jumps into SpongeBob's hand], I'm a multipurpose tool.
,SpongeBob:, Oh. Hey, do you clean snail litter boxes?
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Sure!
,Karen:, ,[From Chum Bucket],Gross.
,Plankton:, It's not like it's actually me touching it, so...
,SpongeBob:, Here she is. Home sweet pineapple.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Infiltration complete. Time to execute phase five! ,[evil laugh],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], You're such a joyful being, SizzleMaster. Here's that litter box you said you'd clean. ,[Tosses spatula into the litter box],
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], ,[Sniffs. Gah!], Karen! I thought I told you not to put smell sensors on the spatula! 
,[The next morning. SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off. SizzleMaster flips SpongeBob out of bed],
,SpongeBob:, Whoop! 
,[SpongeBob lands upside down. SizzleMaster flips his clothes and they fly off the hanger and onto SpongeBob. SizzleMaster brushes SpongeBob's teeth, then feeds Gary, and gives SpongeBob cereal. SpongeBob takes a bite],
,SpongeBob:, Mmm, mmm. ,[SpongeBob bounces to work on SizzleMaster],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! I'm three hours early to work. Thanks to you, SizzleMaster.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], That's no problem, buddy. ,[pulls up a chair], Hey, why don't you take a seat while I get to work for you?
,SpongeBob:, Well, don't mind if I do. ,[Sits],
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Would you like me to man the grill for you today?
,SpongeBob:, Uh, eh...
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], ,[Pulls up barrel as footstool], You deserve a break. And I've been able to handle everything else for you, so...
,SpongeBob:, That is true. Well, I guess I can trust you with my grill while I take a brief respite.
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], ,[Jumps away. Laughs maniacally], Yes! Phase five is finally complete! Time to kick phase six into overdrive! ,[Throws pile of patties onto grill. Turns the heat up], Yes, burn patties, burn! ,[Patties catch fire and turn to ashes. Evil laughing. Sweeps away ashes and some get into SpongeBob's mouth],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Snoring. Then gags and coughs. Takes ash off tongue and inspects it] ,Charred Krabby Patty bits? SizzleMaster, what happened?
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Oh, SpongeBob, I'm sorry. I just wasn't used to this grill. All of the Krabby Patties are gone.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no!
,Plankton:, ,[As SizzleMaster], Hey, I got an idea! ,[SizzleMaster jumps into SpongeBob's hand], I can mix up some new patties in a jiff. If we just go get the Krabby Patty secret formula.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah. Okay. It's just over here in the safe.
,Plankton:, Yes! Ye-e-es! ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Washing money. SpongeBob is opening the safe in Mr. Krabs' office], Hey, whatcha doin', boy?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, my new magical talking spatula that I got from Plankton says it needs your Krabby Patty secret formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, no! Uh, I mean, it was your talkin' spatula, you say? That you got from Plankton? Well, why didn't you say so? ,[Pulls piece of paper out of his shirt], Here. Give your talkin' spatula this recipe. ,[Mr. Krabs winks twice],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I think your blinker's broken.
,Mr. Krabs:, Just read it.
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye! Okay SizzleMaster, the first ingredient is... five gallons combustible cooking oil.
,Plankton:, ,[At Chum Bucket], Yes! Karen, begin production! ,[cooking oil comes out of machine into tub],
,SpongeBob:, One sack coral dust, extra spicy. One bucket fire algae paste. And the final ingredient, disulfide.
,Plankton:, Y-y-yes! ,[laughs], Wait how much disulfide?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Mr. Krabs writes down on paper], The whole enchilada.
,Plankton:, ,[Pouring bottle], I had no idea this stuff was approved for restaurant use.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, it's not... Plankton.
,Plankton:, Krabs? ,[Plankton sees ""Danger! Explosive"" on the bottle], Oh, no. 
,[Chum Bucket explodes. Karen and Plankton land in front of the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Quite a volatile concoction, eh, Planky?
,SpongeBob:, Must be explosive patty Wednesday, eh, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], You got that right, boyo. ,[keeps laughing],
,Plankton:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, hardy-har-har!

"[In the city part of Bikini Bottom, everyone screams and points at a Plankton robot as it grabs a handful of people in each hand and drops them inside the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, ,[everyone running around inside], Oh, good, the lunch rush. Now that my ChumBot has dropped you into my clutches, you'll be forced to eat at the Chum Bucket. ,[everyone stops in their tracks],
,Nat:, What?! You mean you kidnapped us just to sell us your fast food?
,Plankton:, C'mon, it's a standard marketing technique. ,[people leave],
,Nat:, You little twerp.
,Plankton:, Hey!
,Karen:, He's right, ya know.
,Plankton:, Karen?! You think I'm a twerp?
,Karen:, Well, yes, but I was referring to the kidnapping.
,Plankton:, Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.
,Karen:, Maybe it's because you are always wrong.
,Plankton:, Fine, I'm wrong and you're right.
,Karen:, You said it, not me. You know, you're lucky to have me.
,Plankton:, ,[walking away], Why did I ever install that nagging software?
,Karen:, Nagging software? I heard that! Come back and dust my screen!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, money. You're always there for me. ,[kissing noisily],
,Mama Krabs:, Hello, Eugene.
,Mr. Krabs:, Mother! Uh, what brings ya by today?
,Mama Krabs:, I just wanted to see my favorite son.
,Mr. Krabs:, How much of my money do you want?
,Mama Krabs:, Well, I did see the prettiest hat in town today.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye! ,[pushes Mama Krabs out his office and closes his door], Whew, that was a close one.
,Plankton:, Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman - not a girl in a cold-hearted shell. ,[Plankton hears Mama Krabs humming outside so he brings down his periscope on her], Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.
,Karen:, Plankton! You've fallen in love with another woman?! I'm your wife!
,Plankton:, You're a W.I.F.E..,[pulls out chart], ,W,ired ,I,ntegratred ,F,emale ,E,lectroencephlagraph.
,Karen:, Oh, you always pull that one out! ""You're not a real wife, you're just a computer!""
,Plankton:, ,[sighing], Why don't you have an 'off' switch? ,[sees an off switch and smiles],
,Karen:, Plankton, don't you dare... ,[turns off],
,Plankton:, And now to woo that beloved creature. ,[cut to Mama Krabs taking a nap while Robot Plankton is looking through her window. Then the robot grabs her],
,Robot Plankton:, Roses are red. Violets are blue. World domination has nothing on you. ,[she screams],
,Plankton:, Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan. ,[everyone is running around screaming while the robot is using its eye laser to spell out ""I ,[heart], You"" on the ground, but while destroying some of the town when doing this. Mama Krabs reads it and screams a few times], Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal. ,[Mama Krabs is shrieking. The robot walks over to a rock and karate chops a memorial-like statue of Mama Krabs' head and puts her down],
,Mama Krabs:, [stops screaming] Am I really that pretty?
,Plankton:, Oh, yeah... I am smooth. ,[cut to later in his restaurant by a phone], Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this. ,[dial tones beeping; Plankton grunting],
,Mama Krabs:, Hello? ,[Plankton panting in the phone], I'm hanging up.
,Plankton:, Wait! This is your secret admirer.
,Mama Krabs:, Oh, you're that giant robot?
,Plankton:, ,[laughing], No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?
,Mama Krabs:, How did you know I wanted a hat? Have you been spying on me? ,[6 TV screens are set-up to in different parts of Mama Krabs house],
,Plankton:, It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.
,Mama Krabs:, Well, how about the Krusty Krab? Tonight at 8:00?
,Plankton:, Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear. ,[cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!
,SpongeBob:, OK. ,[Mr. Krabs shoves his wallet in SpongeBob's mouth and SpongeBob swallows it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet. ,[sniffs his mother's hat], Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance.
,Mama Krabs:, Isn't it nice, Eugene? It's just the one I wanted.
,Mr. Krabs:, But, Mommy, you shouldn't be spending my inheritance...I mean, since you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up. ,[takes out a hat with holes in it],
,Mama Krabs:, Where did you get this old thing? ,[at a funeral where two fish are paying their respects to the person in the coffin],
,Nat:, She looks so peaceful.
,Fred:, Yeah. But wasn't she wearing a hat? ,[Mr. Krabs is seen running out with the hat behind him],
,Mama Krabs:, You can take this one back to the trash heap.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, Mommy. ,[tosses hat and shovel to Squidward], Squidward, I need you to make a return for me.
,Mama Krabs:, Thank ye for your concern for my finances, but me new boyfriend bought me this hat.
,Mr. Krabs:, Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?
,Mama Krabs:, I don't know. I'm meeting him here, tonight.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime! ,[SpongeBob lunges himself into the door. Cut to Plankton wearing a rose, walking into the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is in a waiter uniform],
,Plankton:, ,[clears throat], I've reservations for two, tonight.
,SpongeBob:, Right this way, sir. ,[SpongeBob pulls back the chair for Plankton as he jumps up on it],
,Plankton:, ,[shouts], Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!
,SpongeBob:, Terribly sorry, sir. ,[reaches into his pocket and takes out a miniature table and chair. Places it on top of the big table, then grabs Plankton and places him in the chair], Will there be anything else?
,Plankton:, Is my tie on straight?
,SpongeBob:, You look fabulous! ,[Mama Krabs walks in], Your gentlemen caller awaits. ,[Mama Krabs walks up to the table],
,Plankton:, ,[pulls rose away from his body], Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight. ,[Mama Krabs notices Plankton],
,Mama Krabs:, Oh, my, you're a tiny thing, but awfully cute. Tell me about yourself. ,[sits down in a chair that SpongeBob has brought to her],
,Plankton:, Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.
,Mama Krabs:, Never heard of it.
,Plankton:, ,[Points to the Chum Bucket], It's across the street.
,Mama Krabs:, Doesn't ring a bell. ,[Plankton shows her the back of a phone book with a picture of him and the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad! ,[Puts the book away], Never mind, never mind. I'd like to hear about you.
,Mama Krabs:, Well...
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton!
,Plankton:, Krabs!
,Mama Krabs:, Eugene!
,Mr. Krabs:, Mommy?
,Plankton:, ""Mommy?""
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps in the air], SpongeBob!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob...!
,Plankton:, This delectable creature is your mother?
,Mr. Krabs:, This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?
,SpongeBob:, And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skulduggery you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out. ,[picks up Plankton by his antennae],
,Mama Krabs:, Eugene, you put me boyfriend down, this instant!
,Plankton:, Boyfriend?
,Mr. Krabs:, But, mommy...
,Plankton:, You heard the lady. Let me go. ,[Mr. Krabs drops him into Mama Krabs' hand],
,Plankton:, That's more like it.
,Mama Krabs:, Come, Plankton. I'm sorry me son had to spoil our romantic evening.
,Mr. Krabs:, Mommy? ,[cut to Plankton cleaning a picture of Mama Krabs then in walks Mr. Krabs], You!
,Plankton:, Eugene.
,Mr. Krabs:, I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.
,Plankton:, I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.
,Mr. Krabs:, All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.
,Plankton:, What are you talking about?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!
,Plankton:, Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family! ,[Plankton frowns], I'm telling you for the last time: stay away from me mother. ,[walks out],
,Plankton:, Not family, eh? I can fix that. ,[cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab],
,Mama Krabs:, Eugene!
,Mr. Krabs:, Mommy!
,Mama Krabs:, What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?
,Mr. Krabs:, Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.
,Mama Krabs:, For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula. I doubt that he even knows that I know it.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles nervously, pulling his shirt as he realizes he let that slip needlessly.], Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.
,Mama Krabs:, I forbid ye to interfere in me private business. Go to your office, now!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, mommy. ,[walks into his office],
,Plankton:, Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.
,Mama Krabs:, Oh, Sheldon.
,Plankton:, Oh, Mrs. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, brother.
,Plankton:, Attention, attention, everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.
,Crowd:, Aw!
,Plankton:, Would you marry me? ,[big diamond ring shown up close],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man! ,[jumps at Plankton],
,Plankton:, Gasp!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[jumps in his mother's lap], Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!
,Plankton:, Too late, Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son! ,[laughs maniacally. Mama Krabs hands the ring back to Plankton], Huh? What's this, honey bunch?
,Mama Krabs:, I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment. ,[Mr. Krabs laughs],
,Plankton:, What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there? ,[Robot Plankton stomping thunderously],
,Robot Plankton:, ,[breaks into Krusty Krab with flowers], I... I... this is very uncomfortable. I'll just wait in the car.
,Plankton:, I don't believe this! You led me on!
,Mama Krabs:, Now, now, Plankton, it's not what ye think.
,Plankton:, I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.
,Mama Krabs:, The formula? Is that what this whole thing was about?
,Plankton:, No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh. ,[Mama Krabs shows her muscles, which show as ships cannons. She punches Plankton back to the Chum Bucket], Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost than never to be loved at all! ,[Plankton ends up flying into the ON switch of Karen],
,Karen:, Working.
,Plankton:, So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?
,Karen:, ,[a laser machine comes down], What did you say?
,Plankton:, ,[chuckles nervously], Nothing, dear.
,Karen:, ,[zaps him], Yeah, that's what I thought you said, honey bunch. ,[Plankton groans],

Paints. Sighs.], Yup. I sure am looking forward to it. ,[eel sting. Patrick screams. He and SpongeBob laugh. ,
,Squidward:, No, no, no! ,[walks to window and sees SpongeBob and Patrick playing with an eel], Grrr! ,[comes outside],
,SpongeBob:, Something Squidward this way comes.
,Squidward:, Alright, you two, I am trying to have a relaxing evening. What in the world are you doing out here?!
,Patrick:, Trying to have a relaxing evening.
,SpongeBob:, We're playing flashlight tag.
,Squidward:, You're playing flashlight tag with an electric eel?
,SpongeBob:, We're using the advanced rules.
,Squidward:, Advanced rules?! That has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever- ,[Patrick picks up the eel and electrocutes Squidward who screeches.],
,Patrick:, You're it. ,[Squidward gets a rash then screams and runs away],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, well played, Patrick!
,[Squidward runs home, sobbing hysterically and rams into his house wall, becoming dazed, and the window rings fall at him then the nose gets him. Squidward goes into his house underneath the sand.],
,Patrick:, Shocking!
,Electric Eel:, ,[Sarcastically], How original.
,[cuts to Squidward's house where he is under his chair in a fetal position],
,Squidward:, ,[crying], All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax in peace ,[sniffs], and quiet.  Is that too much to ask? ,[cries],
,[SpongeBob pokes Squidward's head with a stick],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, we're playing tag, not hide and seek, you silly!
,Patrick:, But we like hide and go seeks, too, if you want to play that.
,Squidward:, ,[still crying], All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax ,[sniffs], in peace! ,[sobs and cries],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, Squidward is really really sad...
,Patrick:, You're right. Let's go poke someone else.
,SpongeBob:, ,[thinks for a moment], How about instead we do something extra special for him? Then he won't be sad anymore!
,Patrick:, Oh, I get it! It'll be like the time I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all Gary's...Uh... I mean, feed Gary for a week.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to do it.
,Patrick:, Vow?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, vow.
,Patrick:, Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?
,SpongeBob:, I like it!
,[cuts to later that night],
,Squidward:, ,[flossing, then in bed, stretches and yawns], Good night... lamp. ,[turns lamp off. Then, sawing and hammering noises begin outside and Squidward turns the lamp back on], I guess having a relaxing evening meant saying up all night with power tools! ,[Checks an alarm clock], Well, it's not that late, even morons have to sleep sometime.
,[puts the clock on the counter  and it spins around until morning and construction sounds are still there],
,Squidward:, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!
,[runs downstairs grumbling],
,Squidward:, When I get those two, I am gonna... ,[opens door], All right, you two, I... ,[gasps. he walks out his door to a Hawaiian-like beach with tikis, palms, and waterfalls],
,Squidward:, It's, it's, it's... beautiful! ,[gazes in amazement], It's too good to be true! It's a mirage. I knew it.
,[starts walking back to his house.], I guess this is it. ,[Gary walks by with a coconut and Squidward grabs it], Insanity. ,[SpongeBob slingshots a Hawaiian shirt in him then Patrick uses a fishing pole to reel down a hat, sunglasses, and lei and drapes it around Squidward's head],
,Squidward:, ,[sadly], Next stop, padded room at the cephalopod home! ,[weeps, then looks around at the beach and drinks some of the coconut], Just go with it, Squiddy.
,[walks around a bit, then comes to a waterfall, goes inside, and takes a shower. then he comes back out to see a tiki boat waiting for him. he gets in and floats down a stream, drinking the coconut. then he realizes it is empty and notices a tiki bar ahead and stops],
,Squidward:, A refill, my good man! What the- ,[notices Patrick behind the bar blending a smoothie], Patrick?! What are you doing here!?
,[Patrick turns around and pours the drink into Squidward's coconut. While he takes out a newspaper and reads it, Squidward drinks the drink],
,Squidward:, It's delicious! What is it?
,Patrick:, A smoothie.
,Squidward:, Remember, Squiddy, just go with it.
,[tiki song starts as three tikis watch Squidward in the boat],
,Tiki #1; Hey, fellas, look! It's Squidward!
,Tiki #2; Hey, buddy, where ya been!?
,Squidward:, Hit it, boys!
,Tikis:, Welcome, to Squidward's Tiki Land! You can relax all day, like a Tiki can! Or lay out in the sun, for a Tiki tan!,[song continues as Squidward floats down the stream],
,Squidward:, Or drink from a coconut that's full of flan!
,Tikis:, Here in Squidward's Tiki Land! You can play all day, in a Tiki band! Then dance all night on the Tiki Sand!
,Squidward:, Don't matter to me 'cause... 'cause I'm CRAZY, man!
,Tikis:, Here in Squidward's Tiki Land!
,Squidward:, Ahhhh, this is the life!
,[Boat bumps onto land where SpongeBob puts out a canvas and paint. Squidward then paints a picture of the wonderful scenery],
,SpongeBob:, It's beauuuuuuuuuutiful!
,[hands Squidward his clarinet and he starts playing],
,Squidward:, I've never felt this happy in my life! ,[laughs],
,[grabs SpongeBob and Patrick by the hands and start dancing in circles. They are laughing and having a good time until Patrick crashes into one of the tikis and knocks them all over in a domino-like effect. The world catches on fire and burns until it's nothing but a pile of burnt ashes],
,Squidward:, My world!
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are left looking at a charred pile of rubble],
,Patrick:, You were right, SpongeBob, we should have used glue instead of earwax.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, especially considering neither of us have ears.
,Squidward:, ,[crying], You've destroyed my beautiful world!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry we couldn't make it last, Squidward.
,Patrick:, Yeah, we really tried to make it last.
,Squidward:, ,[sobbing], Yeah, make it last, ,[bawls uncontrollably],
,[sees the tiki boat still in one piece],
,Squidward:, I know how to make it last!
,[Squidward has attached the boat to a swing and has SpongeBob and Patrick stand and take turns getting hit by it],
,Squidward:, ,[laughs nastily],
,Patrick:, ,[getting hit], Ow!
,SpongeBob:, My turn! Ow!

"SpongeBob:, Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward.
,Squidward:, All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Do you know what today is?
,Squidward:, Annoy Squidward Day?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], No, silly! ,[gets out a calendar], That's on the 15th! ,[day is marked by a picture of Squidward's head], Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money.
,SpongeBob:, That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.
,Squidward:, Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame? ,[shows wall full of SpongeBob pictures for being Employee of the Month],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner! ,[whispering], Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout. ,[shows Squidward reading a magazine], There might be a new face on the wall this month.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[looks over and sees the month of ""January"" with no picture],
,Squidward:, That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. ,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh at SpongeBob as he walks over to the wall and imagines Squidward laughing at him in the picture],
,SpongeBob:, Nooo! ,[begins to sob], How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?! ,[Squidward's picture continues to laugh. Scene goes to SpongeBob grilling and flipping patties until he comes to a patty that won't flip. He tries and tries, but then he flips the patty on to the ceiling. He then tries to get it off of there.],
,Squidward:, ,[peeks in], Need some help? ,[SpongeBob screams], What are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Making...Krabby Patties?
,Squidward:, You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of-- ,[SpongeBob gets the patty off the ceiling, but he flings it into the fan and it sprays Squidward with all the meat], ...garbage.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps off of ceiling], Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
,Squidward:, I already told you, that award is a bunch of... ,[gets sprayed with meat again], ...baloney!
,SpongeBob:, That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
,Squidward:, ,[grabs SpongeBob's hat], It's a symbol that you're a chump! ,[SpongeBob screams, feeling scared],
,SpongeBob:, No, Squidward! ,[screams],
,Squidward:, And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award! ,[Squidward lifts his foot and tries to stomp the hat flat, but his foot hits something that is under the hat, and he screams in pain. SpongeBob lifts up the hat to reveal a stick of lead underneath],
,SpongeBob:, An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
,Squidward:, I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke! ,[Squidward walks away, but is sprayed with meat for the last time. Then we see SpongeBob looking at all his award photos],
,SpongeBob:, What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?! ,[every award photo now has an army hat on],
,SpongeBob Picture:, Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!
,SpongeBob:, But, sir…
,SpongeBob Picture:, There's no room for ""buts"" in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?
,SpongeBob:, Crystal, sir!
,SpongeBob Picture:, Good! Now move out! ,[SpongeBob marches away and then we see SpongeBob looking through his windows through binoculars while Squidward gets ready for bed],
,SpongeBob:, I won't let Squidward win! ,[Squidward sets his alarm and walks off], He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited. ,[SpongeBob sneaks up to Squidward's house by sliding on the ground then through one of Squidward's windows and as he enters he falls to the ground and Squidward's hears the noise while he is brushing his teeth. Squidward goes to check what it is and SpongeBob is standing behind the plant by the door. Squidward closes the door and SpongeBob slides around the door and then by Squidward's bed where the alarm clock is. He is about to grab it when he hears the door handle jiggle so he hides in the pillow on the bed. Squidward gets into bed and isn't comfortable with the pillow as it is so he adjusts it. Tries to adjust it again and you can hear SpongeBob's giggling. Squidward lays his head down and SpongeBob's hand reaches out for the clock and Squidward sees it. Squidward freaks out and throws the pillow against the wall. The cover comes down, revealing SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? What are you doing here? ,[SpongeBob grabs alarm clock],
,SpongeBob:, You can't win that award if you don't get up for work! ,[SpongeBob destroys the clock. Squidward grabs another one and sets it on the stand. SpongeBob grabs that one and destroys it. Squidward opens up a closet full of alarm clocks. SpongeBob grabs a few clocks and destroys them one by one],
,Squidward:, Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!
,SpongeBob:, ,[tosses the destroyed alarm clock over his shoulder], That can be arranged.
,Squidward:, You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
,Squidward:, Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!
,SpongeBob:, I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
,Squidward:, Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
,Squidward:, Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!
,SpongeBob:, Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
,Squidward:, I don't need to sleep! Loser!
,SpongeBob:, Well, me neither! …26-time loser! ,[SpongeBob and Squidward are watching each other through their windows], Look at him. Watchin' me.
,Squidward:, I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?
,Squidward:, No, how about you?
,SpongeBob:, Nope! ,[Squidward gets out his clarinet and plays ""Brahms' Lullaby"". SpongeBob struggles to keep himself awake.], Nighty Night. ,[SpongeBob falls asleep and starts to snore. Later, Squidward tries to walk out, but falls into a very deep square hole right in front of his door],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob comes up with a shovel in his hand],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?
,Squidward:, I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!
,SpongeBob:, All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! SpongeBob! ,[Squidward screams some more. SpongeBob walks back to bed], 
,SpongeBob:, Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo! ,[SpongeBob goes to his bed and sleeps a while. Squidward manages to climb out of the hole; SpongeBob wakes up to hear some hammering], Squidward! ,[Squidward is nailing boards onto SpongeBob's front door], 
,Squidward:, That oughta hold him! ,[SpongeBob saws around it and pushes the door on Squidward and runs away. A cage drops enclosing SpongeBob and Squidward laughs. SpongeBob slides out because he can fit through the bars],
,Squidward:, ,[walks along into a bottle and gets trapped], SpongeBob! Why, you little…! ,[SpongeBob writes ""loser."" on the bottle with his finger in a script writing and runs away. Later he sees a Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty! ,[smells it but the top bun opens up and a claw comes out grabbing SpongeBob's nose], Ow! Squidward!
,Squidward:, So long, Sponge loser! ,[Squidward gets caught in a net and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob runs through a barbed-wire fence and Squidward runs by laughing. Squidward is tied by his tentacles and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob is stuck in a brick wall and Squidward runs by laughing. Later the two are trying to drag along some big items. SpongeBob is dragging an anchor and Squidward is dragging a flaming boat], SpongeBob? Truce? ,[both wave a white flag],
,SpongeBob:, Truce.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!
,SpongeBob:, You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. ,[it’s now dawn],
,Squidward:, Okay, let's have a good clean fight.
,SpongeBob:, And may the better man win. ,[shakes hands with Squidward, now he's thinking], He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
,Squidward:, ,[thinking], Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.
,SpongeBob:, ,[thinking], As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
,Squidward:, ,[thinking], ...I'm gonna make a run for it.
,[SpongeBob and Squidward stop shaking hands, laugh nervously, and hastily run for the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is opening it up],
,Mr. Krabs:, Money, money, gonna make some money! ,[sees SpongeBob and Squidward come running over], Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early! ,[Mr. Krabs realizes that they aren't stopping for anything], Wait! ,[both push Mr. Krabs out of the way and start doing nice stuff],
,SpongeBob:, Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!
,Squidward:, Clean tables, Mr. Krabs! ,[Squidward presses too hard on the table while he is cleaning and breaks it in half],
,SpongeBob:, Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, What's going on here?! ,[SpongeBob drops and breaks the dishes and mops them just like that],
,SpongeBob:, It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, No!
,Squidward:, Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!
,SpongeBob:, Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs! ,[SpongeBob puts his money into the register. Squidward and SpongeBob are in the kitchen], Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!
,Squidward:, There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double your output, SpongeHog!
,Mr. Krabs:, Boys, boys, boys! ,[music gradually speeds up; both SpongeBob and Squidward make many patties to overflow the kitchen, cornering Mr. Krabs], Help! Help! ,[the amount of Krabby Patties fills up the kitchen and the Krusty Krab itself, causing the whole restaurant to explode, sending thousands of patties raining down in front of the citizens],
,Frank:, Hey, free Krabby Patties!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[with his head bursting through one of SpongeBob's employee pictures], Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait! Wait! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! ,[SpongeBob and Squidward come through the picture frame that Mr. Krabs is in and ask him who is the winner, while Mr. Krabs is still complaining about the Krabby Patties],
,SpongeBob:, So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?
,Squidward:, Me, me! It's me! ,[SpongeBob and Squidward continue calling out simultaneously about who is the winner],
,Mr. Krabs:, Boys! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!

,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, who cares about Plankton? What about me restaurant?
,Plankton:, I heard that!
,Squidward:, Enough's enough! ,[Walks toward a thermostat], It's time to end this madness! Let's put this freak show on ice! ,[Sets the thermostat to 25 degrees causing the urchins and Plankton to freeze in the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! What do you know! That seems to be slowing 'em down! Better crank it all the way down, just to be on the safe side! ,[Squidward turns the thermostat down to -100 degrees], That outta do it! ,[Enters the kitchen with SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Gasp! It's beautiful! ,[Notices Plankton and the sea urchins frozen solid],
,[Cuts to SpongeBob wearing an outfit and holding a trash can],
,SpongeBob:, Ok, I'm ready!
,Mr. Krabs:, Here goes nothing! ,[Turns the thermostat back up causing the urchins to defrost and land into SpongeBob's trash can],
,SpongeBob:, Hurry Squidward! ,[Squidward quickly closes the lid on the trash can], We got them! Whoa! Got it!
,Squidward:, Phew...
,SpongeBob:, ,[He and Mr. Krabs go outside], So where do we release them?
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't care. As long it's far away from the Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Stops halfway further up], How's this Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Keep going!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Walks further], How about now!?
,Mr. Krabs:, Farther! ,[Sees SpongeBob walks out of sight then gets a phone call and answers it],
,SpongeBob:, Is this far enough?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Uses a telescope and sees SpongeBob on top of a mountain], No! Farther! ,[SpongeBob walks off], Well, that takes care of that particular problem!
,[Cuts to Mr. Krabs' office],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Answers the phone], Krusty Krab!
,SpongeBob:, ,[In Kelp Forest), Is this far enough?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not far enough! Keep going!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Stops walking], Well, I guess this is far enough. Here you go little fellas! This will be your new home! ,[Takes off the lid], Run! Be free! ,[The urchins runs back into the Krusty Krab], Uh oh...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams and yells], SpongeBob!

,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! What are you doing? It's closin' time! ,[Hands SpongeBob a mop and bucket], Now get out there and swab the poop deck.

,Squidward:, Would you quit it with that tune already?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry. It's just so catchy.
,Squidward:, I don't care. Just can it! ,[Walks back to the register],
,Squidward:, I'll cleanse myself by listening to a little public radio. ,[Turns on radio. ""Musical Doodle"" plays],

,Squidward:, A sign that you're a true boob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes... No! That this song and I were meant to be together.

Want to hear my new record? ,[Gary shakes his head ""No."" SpongeBob chuckles], I knew you would! ,[He puts him down and opens his shell revealing a record player.

I have to get to sleep. ,[He takes the record off the turntable and puts it back in the sleeve], Come to bed when you're ready, Gary. ,[He walks upstairs to his bed humming. He climbs into bed and sighs happily. Suddenly, he hears himself whistling the song. He covers his mouth, but he still continues whistling it. Thinking quickly, he takes a cork and plugs up his mouth. His holes make a hollow whistling to the tune. He wakes up], Oh, fine. I'll just listen to it one more time to get it out of my system. ,[The scene cuts to him downstairs listening to the song],♪Round and round the record spins all day. Listen again.

,[The next morning at the Krusty Krab, a sleepy SpongeBob is standing at the grill in the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pushin' your luck a bit, aren't you, kid? ,[SpongeBob looks up to see him standing in the doorway to the kitchen], You were nearly late this morning. You got to be more concientierous or I'll have to start dockin' your pay. Oh, yeah. That's what I'll do. ,[He whips out a tambourine and starts dancing], Doo dee doo, doo dee doo, doo doo doo! ,[SpongeBob cowers in fear as he shakes the tambourine at him], Musical Doodle! SpongeBob! Wake up, boy-o! Don't you need some patties to get started there?
,SpongeBob:, Of course. Yes, boss! ,[He dumps a bucket of Krabby Patties onto the grill],
,Mr. Krabs:, Just focus on makin' them patties, boy-o.
,SpongeBob:, Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... ,[Gasps, giggles nervously. Mr. Krabs walks back to his office and closes the door watching SpongeBob. As soon as he leaves, SpongeBob's legs start bobbing up and down],
,SpongeBob:, ♪Think you control it, but it's way too hard. Every time it plays, there's an electric charge.♪ ,[He covers his mouth], Hang on. Hang on. Play that last part back for me. ,[He presses his tooth like a rewind button which rewinds the song. He presses the play button which plays the verse that goes ""Think you control it, but it's way too hard.""], That's it! I shouldn't try to control it. I should stop fighting the Doodle's infectious groove. ,[comes into the restaurant with a Krabby Patty on a plate], ♪Trying to stop it is futile. So just listen now to my Musical Doodle!♪ ,[He lands at a table and gives the Krabby Patty to Martha Smith. He then cartwheels to the next table and gives Lonnie a Krabby Patty], ♪Think you control it, but it's way too hard. Doo doo doo-doo doo-doo doo doo doo!♪
,Lonnie:, Young man? ,[SpongeBob is still singing and dancing], Excuse me, young man! ,[SpongeBob keeps singing], I asked for no onions! Young man!
,SpongeBob:, Gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!
,Lonnie:, Ugh! What is wrong with the youth of the ocean today?
,[SpongeBob slides up to Frankie-Billy. As he gives him his Krabby Patty, he splashes soda in his face],
,SpongeBob:, Every time it plays, it's an electric charge! ,[He dances over to another table], The sound in your head is brutal. Now you're infected by the Musical Doodle! ,[Harold reaches for his patty, but SpongeBob keeps taking it away], Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo. ,[He places Harold's patty on top of Abigail-Marge's patty and walks off], You're gonna listen again to the Musical Doodle!
,[At a table, Fred is eating his Krabby Patty. He turns around and sees SpongeBob still singing and his spit gets onto Fred.],
,SpongeBob:, ♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-doo!♪
,Fred:, ,[Groans in disgust], I can't eat like this. ,[He gets up and leaves the table],
,Frankie-Billy:, Me neither! ,[He leaves his table as well as everybody else. In his office, Mr. Krabs is sleeping on a stack of coins when he wakes up],
,Mr. Krabs:, That door squeak sounded decidingly disgruntled. ,[He opens the door and notices the customers leaving], Me customers! ,[He pushes the floorboard up causing the customers to fall back and on top of each other], Why are you running off? 
,Martha Smith:, Well I never got my fries!
,Harold:, I never got my patty!
,Frankie-Billy:, I got drenched in soda and it was all because of that yellow idiot who keeps singing that annoying song!
,[Mr. Krabs looks up and growls as he looks at SpongeBob humming ""Musical Doodle"" while washing a table],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! You gotta cut out that singin', boy! It's repellin' me profits.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I've tried and I've tried, but it keeps playing over and over in my mind.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-huh. Stop singin' that song! One more outburst out of me and I'll send ye home for the day!
,[SpongeBob gasps. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, as he stands at the grill, he tries hard not to sing, but while straining, he closes his eyes, but they sing ""The Musical Doodle!"" SpongeBob keeps them shut],
,SpongeBob:, Keep your trap shut! But it wasn't my trap! ,[Suddenly, he hears his holes on his back singing. He takes a bunch of corks and plugs them up], One more outburst like that and Mr. Krabs will send you home for the day! Okay! Okay! But I feel it building up inside of me! ,[He covers his face, still trying not to sing. The scene then cuts to the kitchen all trashed. The walls have the word ""Doodle"" written all over them, the grill is tipped over, ropes of buns hang from the ceiling, ketchup and mustard bottles are stacked up, and most of the floorboards are torn up. SpongeBob stands hugging himself and humming goofily. Captions show this as ""babbling musically"". Mr. Krabs walks into the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasps], What in blazes are you doing? That's it, boy! You're done for the day!
,SpongeBob:, Try to escape is futile! ,[He runs out on all fours], ♪Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo! Doo doo doo doo-doo! The Musical Doodle!♪ ,[He runs past Sandy who walks into the restaurant, laughs maniaclly],
,Sandy:, What's his deal?
,Squidward:, Oh, he's obsessed with this artless pop tune.
,Sandy:, We gotta help him but quick. He could be in great danger.
,[SpongeBob runs through town],
,SpongeBob:, ♪The song that you ran from is back again. You wonder if the madness will ever end.♪ ,[runs by Patrick standing],
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy!
,[Sandy, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs run after him],
,Sandy:, Come on, Pat! We need your help!
,[SpongeBob, still humming, dances to his house. He crawls up the side and into the porthole window. Sandy kicks the door down as she, Mr. Krabs, Patrick, and Squidward enter],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! Where are you? ,[He looks up to see SpongeBob on the ceiling],
,SpongeBob:, Doo doo doo-doo! The Musical Doodle!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,Sandy:, Get him! ,[She and Mr. Krabs grab him, and pin him to the floor. Patrick pounces on them. SpongeBob is taped to a chair. Sandy looks at him through a magnifying glass],
,Sandy:, Just as I thought. You're suffering from a condition known as ""Earworm."" You see, when your brain becomes stuck on a catchy tune, you're spectable with earworm infection and you've got a nasty one there.
,[In SpongeBob's head, a little green worm sits in his rocking chair listening to ""Musical Doodle""],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's just rip the little sucker out!
,Sandy:, Hold it! We can't do that. It might damage his brain. The only way to drive the earworm out is with another catchy tune.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I got one! It's an old sea shanty me and me mates used to sing on the high seas. ,[He puts a sailor's hat on his eye, singing], ♪It be drowsy and wet on the mighty high seas, for I need a boat for rapid disease. Oh, mateys. Oh, mateys. Don't ever weep! If I so ever sleep, cast me into the deep!♪ ,[He glares at the earworm in SpongeBob's head and is still listening to the Musical Doodle], He ain't budgin'.
,Sandy:, I'll be darned if anyone can resist a Western song while wearing a Western hat. Come here, you! ,[She pulls out a guitar and places a miniature cowboy hat on the earworm, singing], ♪Oh, life on the prairie is lonesome indeed. Not a friend in sight among the rustling weeds. So, when I get lonesome, I don't have a conniption, I just fire up my friend, Generator Contraption!♪ ,[The earworm throws the cowboy hat away], That only seems to have made him madder. We need somebody with really musical talent to get rid of this thing.
,Squidward:, Alright. I'll do it. But only because you required an artist of such high talent.
,Sandy:, Oh, right. Squidward. You play that little doohickey.
,Squidward:, It's called a clarinet. ,[He takes his clarinet and walks over to SpongeBob. He begins playing his clarinet. The earworm falls out of his chair. As Squidward keeps playing, the earworm, wearing a fedora and carrying a breifcase, slips out of SpongeBob's head and slithers away],
,Sandy:, You did it! Drove the little critter out!
,Patrick:, Hold still, buddy! ,[He rips the tape off SpongeBob, as well as most of his skin. SpongeBob runs to Squidward and gives him a hug],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Alright. You're grateful. Now leave me alone. ,[He pushes SpongeBob away and hugs him again. At night, Squidward climbs into bed],
,Squidward:, That was a near little tune I came up with today, if I do say so myself.
,[As he closes his eyes, the earworm slithers across his head, slips under his eyelid, and into his head. As Squidward begins humming, the song he played earlier begins playing in his head],
,Squidward:, Oh, yeah. That's catchy stuff, Squiddy. Catchy stuff. Mmm-hmm. ,[Screams],

,[Mr. Krabs drives up to Old Man Jenkins' farm, which is only ten feet away from the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And we're here.

,SpongeBob:, Old Man Jenkins' farm?
,[The scarecrow starts to shake and Old Man Jenkins' appears from the shirt's opening.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Trespassers!
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs scream. Mr. Krabs hides in his shell and SpongeBob hides behind him. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out over Mr. Krabs' eyestalk holes. Old Man Jenkins comes out from scarecrow costume and points his pitchfork at Mr. Krabs' face.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa there, Jenkins! ,[Old Man Jenkins points his pitchfork further, but Mr. Krabs pushes it back], Pull in your plow! I'm here to pay me grocery bill. ,[holds up his really long bill], Jenkins here supplies all the Krusty Krab's farm fresh ingredients.

,Old Man Jenkins:, And I expect to be paid for them.

,Patrick:, We're certified fools.
,Old Man Jenkins:, Hm….Well, better hitch up your britches. 'Cause we got tons of chores to get done before the big barn dance tonight!
,[Old Man Jenkins' farm and grain silo laugh and dance around. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins leading SpongeBob and Patrick to the oyster coop.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, boy. What's first?
,Old Man Jenkins:, First thing we do is gatherin' pearly eggs from this oyster coop here. The trick is getting them oysters to open up their clams. ,[rubs gently on the oyster's chin], Coochie coochie coo.
,[The oyster laughs and spits out an egg. Old Man Jenkins takes the egg and shows it to SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, shiny.
,Patrick:, Ooh, aww.

,Oyster:, ,[pouts], Uh-uh.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, that didn't work.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you gotta be more gentle.
,[Patrick grabs a crowbar and screams like a crazy maniac. He jumps over and sticks the crowbar in the oyster's mouth. Patrick tries to pry the oyster's mouth open with all his might, but the oyster flips Patrick over.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,[Patrick whirls around in the air and lands on SpongeBob's face. The crowbar lands in Patrick's mouth and falls flat on the ground. SpongeBob's face is flattened and shaped like Patrick's buttocks before popping itself back in shape. The oysters laugh and spit eggs at SpongeBob and Patrick. Old Man Jenkins comes back and sees the basket still empty.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Why, you ain't gathered up a single egg!
,[SpongeBob comes over with his mouthful of eggs and spits them in the basket.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that was egg-citing. ,[laughs],
,[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob, and Patrick at the worm hog pen filled with worm hogs.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, The next chore is to feed the worm hogs.
,[SpongeBob pours a bucket full of slop into the worm hog pen and rings the bell with his nose. The worm hogs run up and begin eating their food. Patrick is also eating the food with the worm hogs.],
,Patrick:, ,[swallows the slop], Mmm. Slop.
,[One little worm hog is trying to eat some of the food and frantically looks for a place to dig in. But Patrick kicks the little worm hog away.],
,SpongeBob:, Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy? ,[feeds some slop to the little worm hog and laughs], That tickles. ,[gasps as the little worm hog begins to swallow him whole],

,SpongeBob:, Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy.
,[SpongeBob grabs a bucket, pulls up a stool and attempts to milk jellyfish jelly from Bessie's udder. He grabs it and goes to milk it, but the udder sprays jelly on the floor. SpongeBob tries desperately to figure out how to milk it, but the udder keeps spraying jelly all over the place. SpongeBob, had enough with the udder, grabs it and goes to milk the jelly in the bucket. But the udder builds up so much jelly, that it causes Bessie to get angry and sprays jelly all around.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, What in tarnation—,[gets sprayed by Bessie's jelly],
,[Bessie gets really angry and throws a fit by kicking everything. She then kicks SpongeBob and Patrick and sends them flying towards Old Man Jenkins. All three of them crash into the farm's front door.],
,Patrick:, Mmm, a Jenkin Jelly sandwich! ,[licks jelly off of Old Man Jenkins],
,[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins giving SpongeBob and Patrick their final chore outside the farm. Patrick eats some of Bessie's jelly while Old Man Jenkins is talking.],

I don't want anything to distract—,[shouts as he sees a jellybee flying over him], A bee! ,[screams], Jellybee! ,[babbles as he tries to shoo it away, but since there is no one steering the wheel, the tractor begins driving around uncontrollably], Get it off, get it off, get it off!
,[The tractor trips over a rock and flips around. The jellybee is now sitting on the tractor's steering wheel.],
,SpongeBob:, Hold on, buddy. ,[grabs a rope from under the seat], I got it. ,[throws the rope], Hyah! ,[misses as it catches the steering wheel], Whoops. ,[the jellybee flies into SpongeBob's nose, but SpongeBob holds it closed so it won't fly out], Got it.
,Patrick:, Yay! Don't let it go. ,[stupidly throws SpongeBob out],
,[SpongeBob lands on the ground and gets dragged around by the tractor.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[spits out sand], Hey, this is fun.
,[The tractor continues to drive while making some kelp bails. SpongeBob skids across the field and dodges the kelp bails.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs while dodging the kelp bails], Whoo-hoo!
,[The jellybee flies out from one of SpongeBob's holes and stings him from behind. SpongeBob screams in pain and flips over to the front of the tractor in slow-motion. SpongeBob gets caught in the tractor's grinders and comes out all tied up.],

,SpongeBob:, Perfect! ,[Patrick is eating a bucket of worm hog slop], Hey, Patrick. You know what time it is?
,Patrick:, ,[pulls his head out of the bucket], Time to put on my ham boots? ,[points to his feet standing on two hams],

,[Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. Outside the farm, a UFO comes flying over and looms downward. The hatch opens and the tractor beam shines down. An object comes out from the UFO, which turns out to be some kind of strange outhouse. The door opens and green smoke fumes. Then, a strange alien appears within the smoke.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I think the party's over.
,[The alien looked like is was going to attack SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins. But as the smoke clears, the alien looks almost like a hill-billy farmer.],
,Farmer alien:, Over? Why, it's just getting started. ,[pulls out a fiddle and plays music],
,[Then some more hill-billy farmer aliens come out and play their instruments. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins join in the fun and dance around with the farmer aliens. The tractor continues driving around the kelp patch as everyone dances.],
,SpongeBob:, How did you guys know about the barn dance?
,Farmer alien:, Well, we seen your invitation.
,SpongeBob:, Invitation? What invitation?
,[The farmer alien activates his fiddle and a green glow surrounds it. SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins and the farmer alien are also surrounded in a green glow.],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm? Wow.
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float upward where they can see the view of the farm.],
,Farmer alien:, ""Barn dance and hoedown tonight. Aliens welcome."" ,[points down to the strange pattern in the kelp patch created by the tractor],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, your crazy tractor driving invited them!
,Patrick:, ,[shows off his crop circle license], I have a crop circle license too.
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float back down to the ground.],
,Farmer alien:, Thank you kindly for inviting us, old timer. Well, we're off to destroy the universe. ,[pulls out a ray gun],
,Other farmer aliens:, Yee-haw! ,[shoot their ray guns before heading back into their outhouse],
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[chuckles], Y'all come back and invade any time.
,SpongeBob:, Annihilate safely.
,[The farmer aliens close their outhouse door and the UFO's tractor beam floats them back into their ship before flying away.],
,Farmer aliens:, ,[as their UFO flies away], Yee-haw!
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins wave good-bye to the farmer aliens just as Mr. Krabs pulls up in his boat.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey-ho, Jenkins! Has SpongeBob worked off me bill yet?
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[rips the bill in pieces], You're all paid off, Krabs. ,[rubs SpongeBob's head], Now come back and visit anytime, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Bye, Old Man Jenkins!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick hop into Mr. Krabs' boat and they drive away from Old Man Jenkins' farm. SpongeBob is telling Mr. Krabs what they did while Patrick sleeps.],
,SpongeBob:, Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Bessie, and then we met some nice space aliens.
,Mr. Krabs:, Aliens? That's ridiculous. I think you've been working too hard, boy-o. Looks like you got farm stroke. You must have been hallucinating. There ain't no such thing as UFOs.
,SpongeBob:, Gee, you think we just imagined it?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, probably—,[screams as a tractor beam suddenly shines over them, shocked he was wrong], A UFO!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens.
,[The tractor beam lifts the boat and abducts SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs. Then the UFO turns and flies away into the sky as the tractor drives by the Krusty Krab.],

"[episode begins at Krusty Krab],
,Patrick:, Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way. I could've spent my lunch drink. ,[slurps his drink and makes a relaxed face], Ahh.
,Patrick:, That's a pretty cool face. ,[chuckles], Check you this one out. ,[chomps, chews],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo! ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, Oh, hey, how about this? ,[dolphin call],
,SpongeBob:, That's awesome! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[snores], Ooh. I know this sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick laughs], SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I here are making faces at each other.
,Patrick:, Funny faces make me laugh! ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?
,SpongeBob:, Why, is there something wrong?
,Mr. Krabs:, Haven't ye ever heard the saying ""If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way""?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Uuh, no!
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me tell you the story of face freeze. ,[thunder claps, SpongeBob and Patrick's tooth chattering, breathing quickly], It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out. ,[Fred raspberries and laughs], But what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people. ,[Fred raspberries and laughs, Sadie and green Monroe wasps],
,Norma Rechid:, How rude! ,[Monroe cries],
,[Fred raspberries],
,Mr. Krabs:, Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time, ,[Fred raspberries], his face froze with his tongue sticking out...
,Fred:, Huh, huh... Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, Permanently!
,Mable:, Weirdo.
,Fred:, ,[muffled], No... no!
,Mr. Krabs:, He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Oh, no!
,Mr. Krabs:, So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Mm-mm.
,Mr. Krabs:, Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.
,SpongeBob:, I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.
,Patrick:, Done and done.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.
,Patrick:, Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.
,SpongeBob:, No faces... at all. Yeah. This is... ,[gulps], easy. How you holding up?
,Patrick:, Huh, fine. You?
,[SpongeBob grunts, but makes an T-shaped face and laughs],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Dun ah eeh.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are both laughing, until SpongeBob stops and looks at his himself],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! ,[Patrick is still ignoring him while laughing], Patrick. ,[pulls out a megaphone], Patrick!
,Patrick:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.
,[Patrick stretching],
,Patrick:, Gosh, you're right.
,SpongeBob:, Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true, let's make lots of faces.
,Patrick:, You mean like this? ,[stretching], Ree eeh eeh!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both, SpongeBob growls],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Aye yi yi yi!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Aw!
,Patrick:, Phee!
,SpongeBob:, Ay yi yi yi yi yi!
,Patrick:, Dun ree ah yee!
,SpongeBob:, Doy doy doy doy!
,Patrick:, Ah ah ooh!
,SpongeBob:, Duh!
,Patrick:, Aydh!
,SpongeBob:, Awoot duh doo!
,Patrick:, Looo ooo ooo!
,SpongeBob:, Day ah dah da dah!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both],
,SpongeBob:, I can't breathe! ,[SpongeBob grabs and mirror and they look into it],Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.
,Patrick:, Yes! But, now do you choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross, ,[Makes his eyes go up to the top of his head], uh? And then slip into and overbite. ,[Pulling out upper jaw], And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one... ,[He pushed his nose, makes his mouth bigger and puts out his eyeballs on the top of his head], The Gary. Meow!
,Patrick:, ,[chuckles], Gloriously disgusting, sir.
,SpongeBob:, Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share then with the whole wide sea. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both],

,Squidward:, I don't wanna make faces I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!
,SpongeBob:, Hey! That's a good one right there.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick laughs],
,Squidward:, Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!
,SpongeBob:, Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!
,Patrick:, Oh yeah? Watch me.
, [They both sleep],
,Squidward:, Whatever works.
,[Later, the Sun rises],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Surprised], Wow, Patrick, you did hold that face all night!
,Patrick:, Actually, I can't move my face at all ,[He feels on his face],
,SpongeBob:, I can't move my face either!
,Patrick:, ,[Oblivious],All right! We did it!
,SpongeBob:,  No, Patrick! It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right! ,[Patrick realizes the situation and gets scared.],Patrick, we have a Face Freeze!
,[,Both scream,]
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Sandy! Sandy!
,[Later at Sandy's treedome],
,Sandy:, Hmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.
,SpongeBob:, And you're a licensed masseuse, right Sandy?
,Sandy:, Well I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension. ,[shows Sandy's hand looking creepy],
,Sandy:, You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. Fell them nights just meltin away. Let's see if i can just get that jaw line back in place. ,[Later, Sandy is done], Phew! OK you two bad news first. That wicked Face Freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.

,SpongeBob:, Doing fine, Mr. Krabs. Just grillin and grillin.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahem. But what's with this cubed posture
,[He touches SpongeBob's head and SpongeBob knocks his claw away],
,SpongeBob:, You hear that? Someone somewhere just dropped a penny.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasps], Where?! Where?! ,[Looks for penny],
,SpongeBob:, That'll buy me some time.
,Squidward:, Let's go, SpongeBob, the orders are pouring out.
,SpongeBob:, On it, Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Onion juice gets in his eye], Onion juice! Ah!
,Squidward:, Come on, SpongeBob! Chop, chop!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, okay.

,SpongeBob:, Oh, dear.
,Harold:, ,[Takes money out of register], I'm taking my clams elsewhere.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait, come back!
,SpongeBob:, Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face?
,Mr. Krabs:, What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?
,SpongeBob:, How should I know, I'm just the cook in these parts.
,Mr. Krabs:, Face me when I'm talking to you, boy-o. ,[SpongeBob turns around with his face down], So I can see your face.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs? ,[shows him a rolling trick], My impersonation of a burrito!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... huh? ,[Sees Patrick walk in with face freeze],
,Patrick:, ,[Sees Mr. Krabs and gets worried],Oh. Uh, is this a bad time, SpongeBob?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, I see what's going on here. ,[Picks up SpongeBob and turns to see his frozen face.], Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Guilty],I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, we thought it was one of your stories.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm losing business, because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ah!, [Mr. Krabs' anger gives himself the face freeze], No! I can't move my face. I've got the face freeze, too!
,Squidward:, What is the hold up in here?
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Squidward, don't get worked up you could get the face freeze!
,Squidward:, Face freeze? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too! ,[Begins laughing hard], This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh. ,[Sees Patrick, begins laughing very hard and he too gets face freeze], Hey, my face! Ah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done. ,[Begins crying],

,SpongeBob:, Not now, Patrick. This bubble's gonna break all records!
,Patrick:, I hope it doesn't break until we get a little closer to the ground.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[gasps], What have I done!? ,[The two start crying for help as the bubble drifts into a cave], We're never gonna get out of here!
,Patrick:, No! ,[the bubble is popped by a jagged point of half a broken amulet], What happened?
,SpongeBob:, ,[pointing to broken amulet], That's what happened, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Whoa, what is it? It looks really old.
,SpongeBob; Antis, what do think that means, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors. ,[Picks up the half of the amulet], SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors for it is your birthright! ,[shoves it into SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Falling], My birthright?! Ow, ooh, ow, ooh, ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!
,[cut to museum],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Whistles], Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin'.
,Security Guard:, Whatever you say.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs pretends to be administration], Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars.
,Old Lady:, But I thought it was free Tuesday.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no, no. Today's Monday. Otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this ""I hate Mondays"" shirt.
,Old Lady:, Good joint.
,Mr. Krabs:, Enjoy the artifacts! ,[Mutters under breath], Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one. ,[Hears SpongeBob laughing], SpongeBob! ,[hides, then re-emerges when SpongeBob and Patrick go into the museum], Hew, that was a close one. ,[Old lady points him out to a police officer then Mr. Krabs runs inside],
,Squidward:, Neptune's ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge... ,[SpongeBob and Patrick run in excitedly, knocking Squidward over], Oh, would you two watch were you're ,[Gasps], What is that? What are you doing with the amulet of Atlantis?
,SpongeBob:, We were just...
,Squidward:, You're going to steal it!?
,SpongeBob:, No. Squidward, we'd never...
,Squidward:, This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso... ,[Sees the amulet's half was still there and is dumbfounded],...ooooome?! You boobs found the missing half to the Atlantean amulet?
,SpongeBob:, What's an Atlantean omelet?
,Squidward:, Amulet, not omelet! It's the key to untold riches!
,[Mr. Krabs shoves SpongeBob and Patrick over violently and faces Squidward],
,Mr. Krabs:, Did somebody say untold riches!?
,Squidward:, Yes Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds.
,Mr. Krabs:, Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of.
,Squidward:, For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!
,SpongeBob:, Why is this bubble painted on the mural?
,Squidward:, That's just the oldest living bubble.
,SpongeBob:, The oldest living bubble, alive! ,[shoves Patrick in front of it], Behold, Patrick-the oldest living bubble!
,Patrick:, This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen.
,Squidward:, That's just a painting, you quarter-wit! ,[to Krabs], Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some dumb old bubble pales in comparison to the arts...
,Mr. Krabs:, Money!
,Sandy:, ,[comes onto the screen from out of nowhere], And science, don't forget science. What's all the hubbub, boys?
,Squidward:, These two chowderbrains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis.
,Sandy:, The Amulet of Atlantis?! Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What are y'all waitin' for? Let's hitch them two dogies up! Go on Squidward!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hurry up Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger. ,[Squidward connects the two halves and a bright light activates. Squidward is happy. Sandy is in disbelief. SpongeBob and Patrick exclaim excitedly.],
,Patrick:, ,[screams],
,SpongeBob:, Hoo hoo yeah, hoo hoo hoo!
,[A van drops from the ceiling],
,Squidward:, The magical path to Atlantis is a van?
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice hot rod flames!
,Patrick:, ,[Coin spins and attaches itself to the van], What's it doing? ,[The door to the van opens. We fade to black, then to the van opening again. Sandy looks inside],
,Sandy:, Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!
,Squidward:, Fabulous decor!
,Mr. Krabs:, Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?
,Robot:, Greetings. Welcome aboard the seaship Atlantis. This is a nonstop trip, so please take a seat, relax, and we'll be on our way.
,Mr. Krabs:, Bet there's some loose change in here!
,SpongeBob:, Ah, so this is what luxury feels like.
,Squidward:, Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub.
,Robot:, Attention passengers, regretfully we lack the fuel needed for forward motion.
,All:, What!?
,[later, we see them all pushing the van to the gas station. Mr. Krabs takes the hose and tries to fill up the van with gas, but can't find the gas tank],
,Mr. Krabs:, Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?
,Robot:, We Atlanteans find the use of fossil fuels to be counter-intuitive, and have developed an alternative source we call song.
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh?
,Robot:, The engine of this vessel is fueled by song. The more you sing of your desires, the closer to Atlantis you will get. Let us commence singing.
,Squidward:, Does that make any sense?
,SpongeBob:, No, but I'm game for singing any day! ♪Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!♪ ,[The van rises up and floats in mid-air. SpongeBob sings off-key], ♪To a land where all our dre-e.♪ ,[The van crashes back down],  Whoops, sorry. ♪To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true.♪ ,[The van rises up high. It makes a hole in the roof], ♪A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee...♪
,
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪Well that's just splendid boy! A land where it rains money! More than you can spend. With fives and tens and fifties and I'll want to be your friend.♪
,Plankton:, ♪Ha, ha ha. Such a valiant desire - hehehe. The lost weapons of Atlantis - the most advanced of all time. As soon as this dopey song is done, I plan to make them miiiiine!♪
,Sandy:, ♪Did you all hear something? I can hardly believe that there's a lost city where having smarts is more important-than being pretty!♪ ,[Sandy makes a clone of herself, and divides herself], ♪With all their advanced science, and my painfully large mind!♪
,Sandy Clone:, ♪I bet we can figure out how to make wondrous things, like melons with edible rinds!♪ ,[they dig in on watermelon. Juice gets on the screen and transitions to Squidward playing piano],
,Squidward:, ♪As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis, with their glorious aesthetics, I'll copy their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!♪
,Patrick:, ♪I'm Patrick, I'm Patrick, Patrick-Patrick-Patrick! And I like um, uuuuh,♪ ,[record scratches], I don't know what I like.
,Robot:, Warning, you have run out of song fuel. 
,All:, ,[Everyone huddles together and screams until Squidward looks out the window],
,Squidward:, Hey, look, it's Atlantis.
,SpongeBob:, Pretty!
,All:, ,[They continue to scream and the bus smashes through a city wall of Atlantis. We see that it has futuristic blue and purple buildings with spires and bubbles. The bus suddenly skids to a stop, unearthing some trees in the process. The five emerge from the bus.],
,Squidward:, You dimwits haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden.
,Mr. Krabs:, Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell.
,SpongeBob:, Ring for the king, huh? ,[rings the bell. A red carpet comes down the stairs and Lord Royal Highness comes out],
,Lord Royal Highness:, Welcome to Atlantis. I've been expecting you. ,[Falls down the stairs], Allow me to introduce myself. I am the Lord Royal Highness, but my friends call me LRH.
,SpongeBob:, My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest living bubble.
,LRH:, Yes, of course.
,Mr. Krabs:, What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!
,LRH:, Oh, if it's gold you want, you'll find it in our vault.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm Eugene. I like money.
,LRH:, Yes, I can see that. Pleasure to meet you. Come, I'll give you the grand tour of our Atlantean fortress. I'm so glad you're all here.
,Plankton:, They're gone. Now to get to those weapons... ,[tries to open the glovebox door, but fails], Trapped! Okay, what do I have to work with here? What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route! ,[Laughs diabolically], Ow!
,LRH:, For centuries, we Atlanteans spent, nay, wasted our talents and energy building the most sophisticated weaponry to defend ourselves from invaders. But we abandoned the idea of warfare long ago and now all these weapons gather dust behind this locked door as an example of what must be done if one wishes to live in harmony with all creatures of this, or any, world.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs], Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!
,LRH:, But of course, follow me.
,Mr. Krabs:, Comin' through, boys!
,Plankton:, These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost. ,[Squeezes under door], Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time! ,[Laughs diabolically. Patchy reappears],
,Patchy:, Well, bad news, kids. Encino's still lost. ,[The radio starts playing], Oh! But, at least I got me radio fixed! ,[Patchy snaps his fingers while listening to it, then it explodes], Well, enjoy the rest of the show. ,[cuts back to Atlantis and then cuts to LRH giving the tour],
,LRH:, It is both an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to Atlantis. We haven't had visitors in some time. You see, being in a lost city has certain disadvantages which I digress. Now if you follow me, I'll show you some of our grandest achievements...
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 karat diamond or else. ,[Mr. Krabs gets on Squidward's neck and starts unscrewing a lightbulb], Ah hold still, Squidward.
,Squidward:, You're standing on my neck!
,[They trip and the light bulb smashes],
,LRH:, Are you all right?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, but I feel odd.
,[Mr. Krabs starts acting strange],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs?
,[Mr. Krabs sniffs],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'd know that smell anywhere. ,[Pockets have mouths and start barking like dogs], Me pockets! They be smelling loot! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
,[His pockets drag him into the hall of Treasure and start taking the treasure],
,LRH:, Those pockets of yours certainly have a nose for treasure.
,Mr. Krabs:, These are me houndstooth pants.
,LRH:, What you see here is a glimpse of ancient Atlantean history. Long ago we abandoned our obsession with wealth to focus on the pursuit of knowledge. So help yourselves to as much as you pockets can carry!
,Mr. Krabs:, As much as me pockets can carry?! ♪Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche!♪ ,[yodels], ♪Look at all this cash, hey, look at all this money! I hope me heart can take it!♪ ,[goes unconscious],
,Fish:, Clear! ,[shocks Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪I'm alright, sonny! Industrial accidents can make quite a mess. Unless you fall into a money press. Oh, make me into money, Mr. wonderful machine, I always knew that me true color was green! Oh, ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of such a place, yes I did! With mountains of money, and rivers of cash. And a pool of coins to make a splash! Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money. They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey! Money and gold and treasure untold! And all of it for me!♪
,LRH:, Mr. Krabs, we're off to see the bubble, would you care to join us?
,Mr. Krabs:, Are you kidding?! I've just got here!
,LRH:, Very well then. Off we go.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, shhh!
,LRH:, Don't dally, lads. You don't wanna be left behind do you?
,SpongeBob:, No, sir.
,Sandy:, You know, LRH, I was born with a scientific curiosity and I was wonderin' if I could have a look at some of your scientific achievements?
,LRH:, Of course, Miss Cheeks, here we are, the combination of all our technology. I give you the Atlantean Hall of Science.
,[Opens a large door],
,Sandy:, Hoppin' acorns. Look at all this high tech gear! ,[Looks at an invention], What does this gizmo do?
,LRH:, It's a biomass converting device. It can take any household object--this comb, for example--and turn it into say, ice cream. Would anyone like to try?
,Both:, Oh me, me, me, me, meee, mee!
,LRH:, Go ahead!
,Both:, Yay!
,[The boys eat the ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, Comb flavored.
,Sandy:, What else can it turn things into?
,LRH:, Actually it can only turn things into ice cream. We haven't worked out that bug yet but I can show you the most amazing/fantastic device created by Atlantean hands. Behold, this grand machine allows the user to shrink down to nano-stature, enabling them to battle germs hand to hand.
,Sandy:, How's it work?
,LRH:, Please have a seat and I'll show you. Now...
,SpongeBob:, Hey, cool.
,[SpongeBob disappears],
,Patrick:, Where'd SpongeBob go?
,LRH:, Right now, his molecules are being broken down into data which is assembled in this computer and is stored on these tapes, then re-assembled on a much smaller scale...
,SpongeBob:, Someone help me!
,LRH:, And finally passes through this tube into this tank which contains every living element known to... ,[peers closer], Oh, dear heavens! It looks like our scientists were working on a very aggressive case of the sniffles! He could be in trouble.
,Patrick:, Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm coming to help you!
,[Patrick disappears],
,Squidward:, Okay, I've seen enough. Let me out of this thing! ,[Squidward disappears and reappears into an 8-bit scene], What's going on here? I... Oh no. ,[screams],
,[Squidward sees a giant nose],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, don't make any sudden movements!
,[The nose sneezes germs and Squidward falls over, jumps quickly and runs],
,Squidward:, Help! ,[Screams],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick follow while they're being chased by germs, and Sandy enters the game],
,All:, Help, Sandy!
,Sandy:, Sounds like them critters is in trouble! ,[The nose catches SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward, and the germs block Sandy from getting to them], Hold on, fellas! I'll be there soon, as soon as I send these critters to their doom! ,[A title screen shows like a Nintendo game], ♪Look out, germs. The end is here, Your days are numbered, 'cause Sandy's here! I'll get these germs, and make 'em pay, with some good old fashioned ka-rah-tay.♪ Hi-yah! ♪If I borrow some elements from the periodic table I can mix up a brew that is sure to disable any virus, bug, or sniffle that steps into my path. And make them feel my mi-cro-sco-pic wrath!♪ Hi-yah! ,[she hits the nose with a submarine and defeats it, the rest of the gang gets saved, they all cheer, then the game says: ""Game Over"". Everyone is out of the machine],
,LRH:, Well, shall we continue on with the rest of the tour?
,Sandy:, Y'all head out without me.
,[Sandy goes back in the machine again],
,LRH:, Well then, good luck. Have fun. We'll see you at dinner. ,[To SpongeBob], Your friend Sandy certainly is an excitable one.
,SpongeBob:, Quite.
,Squidward:, Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoo's the longest.
,[The camera zooms in to the heater vent where Plankton is hiding, Plankton chuckles],
,Plankton:, ♪Oh, what a beautiful sight! Weapons as far as the eye can see. But which one will be right for me? How do I pick? Which one will do the trick? Which is best to guarantee eternal rest? So many weapons! How do I choose? Look at this one with a beautiful fuse! And with this one I couldn't lose. That one will surely give them the blues... And this one here matches my shoes!♪ ,[serious tone], Come on, Plankton, just pick one and forget about your shoes! Eeny, meeny, minie moe, I pick you, now let's go! ,[jumps into a giant tank's gun. Scene cuts to LRH giving the tour],
,Squidward:, This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?
,LRH:, Gentlemen? What is art?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, oh, I know, I know!
,[Squidward shoves SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty.
,LRH:, Not even close! ,[Squidward looks shocked], Art is what happens when you learn to dream. ,[Gives SpongeBob a blue paint brush], Go ahead. Dream a little.
,[SpongeBob touches the wall with the brush and the paint creates SpongeBob's house door],
,SpongeBob:, It looks like my front door!
,LRH:, Behold! The Hall of Arts!
,[He opens the door, they step in, and Squidward's mouth opens],
,Squidward:, Incredible! ,[cries], The creativity! The artistry! ,[Walks in front of a painting], This painting is so realistic! It looks like you could step straight into it.
,LRH:, And you can!
,[Throws Squidward into the painting],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa!
,Squidward:, This place is amazing! ,[steps into other paintings], ♪Isn't this great, isn't this neat, I'm a living work of art from my head to my feet! From the very first drawings on walls in caves, art has been what the heart and soul craves! So pick up a brush, a pencil or pen. If you don't like this one, paint it again! From now on please call me Sir Real. I can wait for your impression to congeal. Take it from an undersea renaissance man. I'd even look great on the side of your van! Any way you carve it, I am art and art is me. Ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the uh, schism. Between minimalism and cubism. My personality may be of the cynical type. But I've finally found something that lives up to the hype. I can say honestly and with great certainty, that Atlantis is where I want to spend eternity!♪ ,[holds note. Scene cuts when Squidward's out of the painting],
,Atlantean:, Hey, can you not sing? I'm trying to model here.
,Atlantean Painter:, Now hold on Nando. Why don't you take five. I'm really diggin' this squid's form.
,[The other Atlantean sighs and walks away],
,Squidward:, Looks like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty. You guys go on ahead!
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Bye, Squidward!
,[They leave and Squidward poses],
,LRH:, Now this section of town is known for its advances in the science of fondue cooking.
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, sir, this tour has been great and all, but uh, can we see the bubble now?
,LRH:, Do excuse me. Most folks don't stay with the tour this long. Of course you can. First, remember this. This bubble is over one million years old. It was brought here when the first Atlanteans colonized this place. Deftly hand carried over billions of light years from our home planet. It is our people's most beloved and treasured ancient relic. But most importantly remember to have fun!
,[Points to where the bubble is, and they walk to the bubble],
,SpongeBob:, There it is Patrick!
,Both:, The World's Oldest Living Bubble!
,[They land on the safe keeping tube],
,SpongeBob:, Look at it, Patrick! So ancient, so floaty. It is the most beautiful, wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!
,Patrick:, Like a delicate air raisin!
,[They slide off the glass],
,LRH:, Now if you'll excuse me, I have to make ready for tonight's dinner. So I'm just going to leave you two friendly strangers alone with our most beloved ancient and fragile Atlantean relic. Join us in the dining hall when you've had an eye-full!
,[LRH leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, Mr. Lord Royal Highness, sir. ,[They shove their faces on the glass], Just look at it, Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look. ,[They lean in but the glass moves], Patrick! Get the--
,Patrick:, Oh, golly! Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!
,[They managed to get the glass back after a close call when the bubble land on the glass on SpongeBob's side and bounces off without any harm, they laugh in victory],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo, that was a close one buddy!
,Patrick:, Yeah! We almost popped the most prized possession of all Atlantis-eans! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen.
,Patrick:, Ooh! Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before we leave.
,SpongeBob:, Great idea, Patrick!
,Both:, Cheese!
,[Patrick's camera flashes, and the bubble pops],
,SpongeBob:, ,[teeth closed], Patrick, did you hear something?
,Patrick:, ,[teeth closed], A sort of a popping sound?
,SpongeBob:, Mmm-hmm.
,[They look at each other screaming and their skin peels off, and SpongeBob's eyes fall in his mouth. Scene cuts to the gang having dinner],
,LRH:, So sorry I'm late. The tour ran a little long. So, how are you all enjoying our beloved city?
,Squidward:, I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college.
,[Shows LRH a painting],
,LRH:, Absolutely marvelous! And Eugene, I assume the hall of treasure was everything you hoped for? ,[Mr. Krabs is brain-washed by the money and talks gibberish], And Sandra, how did you find our laboratory?
,Sandy:, They are just amazing! I used your invention room to make this!
,LRH:, Splendid. What does it do?
,Sandy:, I'll show you. ,[Presses a button and the food goes directly in her stomach], Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet! This is just the beginning! I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your high-tech lab!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick walks in feeling nervous],
,LRH:, SpongeBob, Patrick, tell me. How did you enjoy our rarest and most prized possession?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gulp], We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!
,All:, Huh?
,LRH:, Ahahaha! Come. Enjoy the best Atlantean cuisine has to offer before you leave.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick shakes],
,Squidward:, What is wrong with you two morons?
,SpongeBob:, We have to go home now!
,Squidward:, Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?
,SpongeBob:, Because, uh, Gary misses me?
,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house where Gary is having a party with other snails],
,Patrick:, We destroyed your most prized possession! ,[Covers mouth],
,LRH:, ,[pauses], Ahahaha! If there's one thing we Atlanteans enjoy, it's a healthy dose of dark humor!
,SpongeBob:, It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!
,[Sandy and Squidward gasped],
,LRH:, Haha. That's not the real bubble. It's just a prop for the tourists. This is the real deal.
,[Holds up the real bubble in a bottle],
,Both:, Ooh!
,[Patrick takes a picture of the bubble and the bubble finally pops],
,LRH:, ,[snarls], Summon the Atlantean Royal Guard! ,[The guards come and grunt, SpongeBob and Patrick shakes in fear for what they've done], Seize these hostile bubble poppers! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and Squidward and Mr. Krabs join them],
,Sandy:, Don't just stand there! Move!
,[She pushes the gang, the guards attack with a trident, pickaxe, and mace],
,Mr. Krabs:, Can't you go any faster Sandy?
,Sandy:, Maybe, if y'all use your feet!
,Mr. Krabs:, Never mind! Just keep doing what you're doing!
,[Sandy groans, the guards shoot clear balls at them, Sandy throws Patrick like a boomerang, Patrick hits the wall],
,Sandy:, Come on, Patrick!
,[She grabs Patrick, the guards shoot and Sandy uses SpongeBob as a shield],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], That tickles!
,Sandy:, Hang in there, little buddy! ,[she uses Squidward's tentacles to grab the shooting balls, and fires the balls at the guards by pulling Squidward's nose. Then, she uses Mr. Krabs and he uses his claws to knock the guards out of the way],
,LRH:, Don't let them get away!
,[The guards follow the gang outside the building, but they all see Plankton's giant tank, Plankton aims at them while laughing diabolically. Patchy reappears],
,Patchy:, ,[realizes that there is no water left], This is the end of patchy. No water, no food, and still no Encino. And here come the vultures the pick me bones! ,[Potty flies up], Shiver me timbers! It's Potty! I wonder what parrot tastes like... Come back here! Uh-oh. Here come the hallucinations.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants. ,[Patchy is excited, and then he cries], Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get to Encino.
,Patchy:, But, Encino is gone.
,SpongeBob:, It's not gone, if you believe.
,Patchy:, Believe, believe. ,[falls asleep. Wakes up and reads the sign], Welcome to Encino! It's back! ,[hugs the sign], SpongeBob was right! All I had to do was believe. ,[laughs],
,♪You got to believe. It was out of sight. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. The sky above, and the ground below. Bring me back into Encino. It was lost, some time ago, I'm just glad to be back home. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. You got to believe. I'm back in Eencino. You got to believe. Everything's all right.♪
,Baby:, Ohh! Ohh!
,♪You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to...♪
,Patchy:, ,[drops his ice-cream scoop and we hear strange sounds. Potty squawks, and then pokes Patchy], Ow! Ow! It was all a hallucination. Encino's still gone! ,[Patchy cries], Oooooo, a sandwich. Potty, you're a lifesaver. ,[opens a sandwich], Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oh, Potty, you know I don't like mayo! ,[sees a vulture], Here, you want some? Go on. Take it. You know, I don't like the mayonnaise, you know. You know, when it gets above 130, 135, it gets kind of grody, you know.
,[cuts to the gang standing in front of the tank],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs diabolically], Cower to me, fools! I have commandeered the most powerful weapon in the Atlantean arsenal! Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath! ,[He stomps on the switch, and the switch didn't budge], Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, prepare to taste my wrath! ,[He stomps on the switch rapidly harder, but it still didn't budge], Oh, you! ,[Grabs a rock while struggling], Prepare to taste my wrath! ,[Throws the rock on the switch, and the switch budged],
,Computer:, Launch sequence deployed! ,[The tank shakes and Plankton laughs diabolically, everyone gasps and they hold onto each other. The tank shoots out ice cream and a cow's moo is heard, and SpongeBob and Patrick starts eating the ice cream],
,Patrick:, Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream.
,Both:, Thanks, Plankton!
,Plankton:, Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!? ,[Plankton jumps out of the tank], Oversized ice cream maker! ,[Kicks the tank], Yah! Ouch! Ow!
,LRH:, Look! A talking speck! This talking speck will make a fantastic ,[looks at SpongeBob and Patrick], replacement for our recently deflated national treasure! ,[Looks at Plankton], ,[Babyish tone], Won't you little fella?
,Plankton:, I'll destroy all of you--
,[LRH squeezes him],
,LRH:, Amazing! This is so much better than that dusty old bubble!
,[Plankton is in the baby bottle cage],
,Plankton:, You haven't seen the last of me! When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of-- ,[someone takes a picture], Hey! Can't you read? ,[Points at sign], No flash photography!
,[The gang is getting on the van],
,LRH:, So nice to meet you all. I hope you have a safe journey back home. And do come back any time.
,SpongeBob:, So long. And thanks for the tour.
,[Everyone is in, and LRH closes the door, he takes the amulet off the van and gives it to a guard],
,LRH:, Dispose of this quickly. We can't survive anymore visitors like these.
,Guard:, ,[salutes], Sir, yes, sir!

Mr. Krabs:, Then what's all this useless junk? ,[the junk is shown],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What in blazes are you talking about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squidward:, Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us. ,[smiling], On second thought, keep 'em waiting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, ♪That one... special... sweater...♪ ,[yelling continues], Squidward, this crowd is insatiable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Then why don't you back in the kitchen, and grab some patties, and give them what they ,[screams], came here for?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy. ,[crowd booing],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nancy:, Is this some kind of joke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd. ,[SpongeBob is now juggling patties],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bill:, Oh, now what's he doing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bill:, We're losing our appetites!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, We want patties!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! ,[SpongeBob slips and patties flip in the air],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, Boo!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No! ,[talking in his head], My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted. ,[patties land on the grill],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bill:, Hey! Finally!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nancy:, That's what we've been waiting for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[dotted lines form from his eyes to point to patty],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks. ,[SpongeBob puts a whole ton of patties on the grill],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, Yay!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You like that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bill:, It's what we wanted all along.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[thinking], It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns! ,[speaking], It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this? ,[Flips patties inside buns],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, Yeah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customers:, We want onions! Cheese! Yeah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Ready for the grand finale? ,[splatting],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, Whoopee! Krabby Patties!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Krabs:, Finished! At last. ,[Shows the picture to Squidward and SpongeBob, who is now at the chef's window], What do you boys think of my masterpiece?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[reading the sign], New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, What?! That is totally unfair!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or-- ,[Squidward zips up the chef's window],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Zip it! ,[Mr. Krabs places the sign on the front window. He stares out of the window and notices something surprising from across the street],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What the...? ,"[The Chum Bucket now displays a sign in front saying that it is """"now open 23 hours""""]", The Chum Bucket open 23 hours?! So, that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he? ,[A customer walks up to him, tray in hand],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fish:, Sure. I don't know. Why not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Well, he's wrong!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Krabs:, As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours! ,[SpongeBob's head bursts through the wall, in the place where the chef's window used to be],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming. ,[SpongeBob exits the punctured hole in the wall and stands flat on the floor. He starts pinching himself twice, then yells in pain. He pinches himself again and yells again, then does it four more times. After a brief pause, he pinches himself yet again], Well, I'm not dreaming. ,[Switch to a telescope view of the front window of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs walks up to the sign and amends it to read, Open 24 hours!],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, ,[behind the telescope], Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me. ,[He starts walking into the Chum Bucket], My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula! ,[Laughs evilly. He notices after a while that his computer wife, Karen is not laughing with him], Why aren't you laughing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, I've heard this joke before. ,[Scene switches to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is standing near the cash register with a cowbell and beater in his hands],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3! ,[The camera shows the customers of the Krusty Krab eating their food and not being swayed by Mr. Krabs' excitement], Yee haw! Day 3!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[inside the kitchen, holding a Krabby patty], Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete. ,[Bubbles fill the screen as the episode transitions to the outside of the Krusty Krab.

Mr. Krabs:, Day 10 of non-stop service!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[exhausted], Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, No one goes home!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[points to the bags under his eyes], Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags! ,[The camera shows a closely detailed picture of Squidward's drowsy eyes, and a lady screams.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[grilling hamburgers in the kitchen], ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I.♪,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You could learn a few things from that boy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[through his teeth], Mr. Krabs, he is not normal. ,[SpongeBob starts kissing a Krabby Patty],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work. ,[Squidward drops over and starts snoring. Plankton, wearing a tight black suit, descends from a rope on the wall and monitors at SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion! But with a little more pressure, the sponge will crack like an egg ,[clenches fist],, and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche. ,[Slurps and then does an evil laugh. Mr. Krabs notices Plankton, but since he is tiny, black and suspending from a coil, he believes Plankton is a small insect],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Eww! A spider bug. ,[Mr. Krabs squishes him and the scene changes to the Chum Bucket a while later. Plankton is on the phone, ordering an item from the Krusty Krab],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Come on! ,[Mr. Krabs finally picks up on the other line],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Krabs:, Day... ,[record scratch], anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[Breathing heavily next to a pile of Krabby Patties], 43...! ,[Gasps, as the top of his head expands and shrinks. SpongeBob places a tray of food items on the chef's window and then shoves them off. He does the same again for a smelly boot],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What the flimflam?! ,[Enters the kitchen and notices SpongeBob looking like a wreck], What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food. ,[SpongeBob does not answer him], Boy? ,[SpongeBob starts fighting the air with his spatula. Mr. Krabs hits him on the back of his head],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[Drowsily], Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs. When did you get here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Boy, I'm worried that... ,[Mr. Krabs turns into a giant talking Krabby Patty], Got it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[wiping his eyes], I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Sure, I said I'm worried that... ,[He turns into a Krabby Patty again. He turns back into himself after he stops talking],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal: ,[he starts screaming and throwing his hands in the air. He hides in the corner, waving his spatula at Mr. Krabs], Stay back! I'm warning you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[Starts walking towards SpongeBob], All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to... ,[Mr. Krabs turns into a Krabby Patty again],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, don't eat me! I'm too chewy! ,[Screams and runs outside the kitchen, where his eyes bulge as he notices the customers are now Krabby Patties], Holy shrimp! They're everywhere! ,[Runs screaming and knocks into a Krabby Patty, falling],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krabby Patty:, ,[looking at him], What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[Running and screaming. He starts screaming at two Krabby Patties sitting at a table, then one going to the bathroom and then screaming and pointing at Tom.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sally:, I told you that shirt was hideous. ,[SpongeBob screams again as Mr. Krabs grabs him and pulls him into the kitchen, while SpongeBob is digging his nails into the floor],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, no! I want to live! ,[He enters the kitchen, but bursts the door open], I want to live ,[He's dragged back inside. The camera shows Squidward, exhausted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[inside the kitchen], Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[patting SpongeBob's head], There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular. ,[Hands SpongeBob his spatula],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[repeating], Spatular.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[showing SpongeBob his grill], and here's the grill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[repeating], Grill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[Showing SpongeBob some patties in his hands], and here are some fresh Krabby... ,[SpongeBob starts screaming again. When Mr. Krabs pulls the patties away, SpongeBob's scream lessens. He pulls the patties out in front of him and continues pushing and pulling them forward],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Hmm, there may be a problem after all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What does this mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr Krabs:, It means there's something wrong with your head. Look, I think maybe you should see a professional.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wrestler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, No, a psychiatrist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist? ,[A paper airplane hits him in the head], Ow! ,[Plankton is at the chef's window and then drops down. SpongeBob starts reading the paper], Hey," look at this! """"Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias"""". Gosh", I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. Wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see... ,[Mr. Krabs holds up a patty in front of SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob points and screams at it, then runs off. The scene switches to SpongeBob, paper in his hand, finding out where the psychiatric center is. SpongeBob looks up], Well, this looks like the place. ,"[It is the Chum Bucket with the sign """"Dr. P. Lankton Psychiatrist"""" on it. SpongeBob enters", looking for the psychiatrist], Hello? Doctor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch. ,[SpongeBob sits on the couch. He turns his chair around so that we can see Plankton wearing a costume and beard], Now... ,[chuckles], Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink ,[laughs],. Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Hope? Hope!? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you! ,[Laughs, but then clears his throat], Yeah, I mean, you'll be cured in no time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Let's start with a simple exercise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Jumping jacks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I want you to close your eyes. ,[SpongeBob lightly closes his eyes], Tighter ,[he closes his eyes tighter], Tighter ,[Tightens them even more, until the rip off], Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I see giant Krabby Patties!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Good, and what are they made of? ,[He starts recording on a voice recorder],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hatred!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! ,[He produces a grand piano from nowhere and somehow holds it threateningly in the air],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Wait, where'd you get that piano? ,[SpongeBob smashes Plankton with the piano. He groans. Later, he continues his psychology], We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'm ready!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Spatula.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Spatula.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Bun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Bun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, See, the key is to say something different to what I say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, okay, I've got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Potato.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Potahto.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Tomato.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Tomahto. ,[Scene switches to SpongeBob kneeling on the floor looking at various cards],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't know… oh, yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Um, you're making me nervous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Oh, okay. ,[Walks to and sits on his chair], I'll be over here, then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'm finished! ,[Plankton gets up and walks to SpongeBob], I've arranged them into a piano. ,[The piano falls on Plankton],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Fiber?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, No, hypnosis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hypnosis?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, ,[holds a ticking watch in front of him], Now, keep your eyes on this watch. ,[shakes it slowly], When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh,3,[SpongeBob falls asleep and begins snoring very loudly], I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula. ,[Snaps fingers, but SpongeBob continues snoring loudly. He snaps a couple more times], Hey, wake up! ,[He clashes cymbals, blows a trumpet and beats on drums, but SpongeBob continues snoring, even louder than the sounds], Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious? ,[He holds a loud ringing cell phone up to his ear, but SpongeBob's snoring is even louder], Why won't you wake up?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[We peer into SpongeBob's dream. In it, he is chasing jellyfish, but then gets caught in a fishnet by a huge Krabby Patty, who then eats him. Inside the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob looks around in the dark],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Where am I? ,[Lights turn on and he is lying in his bed in his home. The door to his room opens and a huge Krabby Patty walks in],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krabby Patty:, Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza. ,[Hands SpongeBob a cookie pizza],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gee, thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krabby Patty:, And here's some chocolate milk. ,[Hands SpongeBob a glass of chocolate milk],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, The king of flavored dairy drinks! ,[He drinks it quickly], Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krabby Patty:, Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here ,[points to a part of SpongeBob's stomach], .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, In my heart?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krabby Patty:, Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, ,[In real life, shouting into a loudspeaker], ,Wake up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[wakes up, yawning], It worked! I'm cured!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, But what about the formula?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work! ,[SpongeBob runs away, towards the Krusty Krab], Thanks for everything, doc!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, ,[yelling], No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick! ,[Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping burgers normally],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Well, I can safely say," """"No more 24 hour shifts""""", because 23 hours will be plenty! ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs...! ,[SpongeBob then starts laughing],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, No, seriously. Get back to work!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I caught something terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[over phone], What'd you catch?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I caught sight of the calendar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, ,[laughs so hard his tongue pops off], Hey, your shoes untied. ,[tongue looks down], April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! ,[laughs and hugs his tongue, which smiles.

Squidwards sees SpongeBob wearing a big blue machine of his head saying thinking as SpongeBob thinks really hard for an idea.], Of course, he actually has one. ,[Squidward leaves his cash register and sees a strange patron squirting ketchup all over the Krabby Patties. He then picks them up and drops them all over the floor], To each, his own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fiasco:, Mustard!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yes, your freakishness. ,[he swipes the mustard from Squidward's hand and squirts it all over the platter. Squidward sighs in disgust as mustard splashes onto his face],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fiasco:, ,[drops the empty mustard condiment as he is finished], Like our own fleeting existence, an untimely end has come upon this Krabby value meal. ,[he notices something on the platter and scrapes it off before he leaves],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Good riddance. ,[just as Squidward was about to spray the table, he he quickly notices what the patron has done on the platter], What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls. ,[gasps], Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward. ,[Mr. Krabs takes the platter and tries to throw it away, but Squidward takes it from him], ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Ok, let's not overdo it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist! ,[pulls out the Art Wonk magazine], He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[reads the magazine and sees the picture of Fiasco and his art in it], Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[takes the Fiasco from Squidward], Ohh, what is this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[takes it back from SpongeBob], This is an authentic Fiasco!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customers:, A Fiasco? ,[gets up from their tables and looks at the Fiasco in amazement], Ooh!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dave:, An original Fiasco, you say?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gus:, He's one of the famous picture-drawing artistes!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nancy-Suzy Fish:, Just look at his audacious use of pickle in this piece.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jimmy Gus:, ,[stutters], What's your asking price?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Hold it! ,[takes the Fiasco],  I'll take a million for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[takes it back], It's not yours to sell! I found it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Me plate, me buns, me mustard, ,[tries to take it from Squidward], me Fiasco.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, You tried to throw it away! ,[pulls it back], It's mine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Farfel Bainbridge:, Let's not be hasty. It belongs to…neither of you. Farfel Bainbridge: Curator of the Bikini Bottom Art Museum. We curators have a way of sniffing these things out. ,[takes the Fiasco from Squidward and examines it. He sniffs it for a little bit], ,[gasps], It's authentic! Aahh! Which makes this a national treasure! ,[everyone cheers as Farfel places the Fiasco back on the table and puts a glass lid around it], And for preservation, it must be hermetically sealed! ,[blows his whistle], And guarded by Bikini Bottom's finest! ,[three police men rip off their costumes, revealing themselves],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officer John:, Ready for duty, sir!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Farfel Bainbridge:, Well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of Bikini Bottom. Unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this grease-trap to get a look at this great piece of art.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic. ,[goes to a scene where the Krusty Krab has a really long line waiting to see the Fiasco], Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece! ,[Evelyn and Frankie look at the Fiasco], Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frankie Billy:, Two Krabby Patties, please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Each!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, ,[while all the customers are lined up, Plankton sneaks up behind a small rock outside of the Chum Bucket], So, what have you got for me today, huh? ,[looks through his telescope], No Krabby Patty in sight. ,[notices the customers looking at the Fiasco], What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to reverse engineer a whole Krabby Patty! ,[gets down and paddles to the Krusty Krab with a tiny bag on a unicycle], Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[As Mr. Krabs counts his money and sniffs some of them from his valuable success, he hears a loud scream in the dining room], I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying! ,[opens his office door and sees Plankton making a getaway with the Fiasco in his bag], Stop that thief!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Stop thief! ,[pushes the alarm button and emergency bell rings and alarm blares; Cut to the police car driving after Plankton],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free! ,[Just then, he hears the sirens of the police cars. As he turns around, he notices several more police cars following him at high pursuit.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officer John:, Stop thief!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Ahh! ,[paddles faster], What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage! ,[the police chases Plankton into the streets of Bikini Bottom and passes by the Movie Palace. Plankton manages to take refuge in the movie theater], What's going on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Female movie character:, How long do you think we'll be here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Male movie character:, I don't know. But my stomach feels all tingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Female movie character:, Mine does too. ,[the movie characters slowly attempt to kiss, until Officer Rob bursts through the screen],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officer Rob:, Hey you! Yeah, you in the chair!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officer John:, Don't move! ,[the cops burst out of the screen and chases Plankton out of the movie theater and into the supermarket],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, ,[as the cops search all over the market, Plankton hides in a batch of flowers but his eyes gets all watery due to the pollen], Achoo! ,[the cops turn around and sees where Plankton is hiding], Blasted pollen allergies! ,[Plankton notices that the cops are looking at him and quickly runs out of the market as the cops chase him from behind. He somehow manages to take refuge in a floating satellite in outer space, thinking that he is safe.], Ahh, I should be safe in space. ,[he hears the hatch door open and sees that the cops are still after him only in spacesuits this time],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officer John:, Stop thief!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, You gotta be kidding me! ,[exits out of the satellite as the cops pursue from behind. Sooner or later, Plankton becomes exhausted from being chased around by the cops. He then stumbles upon Patrick's rock], Hello? Hello? ,[knocks], Open up! ,[continues knocking], Open up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[opens his rock as he is in his purple robe], Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning! ,[slams his rock],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Wait, what? ,[looks around and sees SpongeBob's house and bursts in the front door with a wooden spoon in his hand], Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'! ,[SpongeBob raises his hands in the air], Ok you two, against the wall! ,[SpongeBob and Gary get off of the chair and sofa and walk up towards the wall], That's it. Nice and slow. ,[Plankton walks into the house and places the bag on the table revealing the Fiasco he has stolen to SpongeBob. Plankton jumps up onto SpongeBob's chair], You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I-I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, you need to turn yourself in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Turn myself-What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Who's that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Me, you imbecile!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Now you've gone too far!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I can't believe you're calling me that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Believe it, Man Boy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[comes in and appears to be eating something], Hey! What did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you eating?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table. ,[an empty plate is shown as it reveals that Patrick is eating the Fiasco that Plankton stole. SpongeBob and Plankton gasp in horror as Patrick swallows the Fiasco and burps], Not bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Ohh, he's an accomplice too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[bursts through the front door with the cops behind him], Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officer John:, Well, well, well. If it isn't the art thief himself. Drop the spoon. ,[Plankton throws the spoon away after realizing he has no place to run anymore], You're all under arrest until we figure this out. ,[puts handcuffs on Squidward's wrists],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:," But what do you mean """"all""""? ",[stammering], I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep! ,[cuts to the Bikini Bottom Police Station],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Officer John:, ,[locks Plankton away in jail as SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, and Mr. Krabs stand there and watch], Thanks for clearing this whole mess up, Mr. Krabs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finito! ,[begins to cry],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[thinks for a second and comes up with an idea, snaps his fingers], Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution. ,[cuts to the Krusty Krab with a really long line],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[stands behind the x-ray and presents the Fiasco he accidentally ate to the customers, which amazes them. As he is showing it to them, he giggles for a little bit], X-rays tickle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fiasco:, Such artistic genius! ,[throws his paintings on the floor and smashes them to bits], I'll never paint again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[reveals that he is still behind bars at the Bikini Bottom Police Station], Hey, don't I get a phone call?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! ,[turns to the screen and laughs as his hat spins], Hey, kiddies! It's your old pal, Patchy, floating somewhere over Bikini Bottom. I sailed down here to witness something that only happens every 100 years. Why, me and my trusted parrot, Potty, wouldn't miss it for the world, would we, Potty? Potty?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Rah! ,[hits Patchy], I'm just here for the buffet. ,[grabs a fish from the water],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oh, Potty! ,[grumbles], Give me that! ,[drops the fish in the boat; he picks it up with his mouth and spits it back in the water], Potty, I told you to leave those fish alone! What do you think you are, a seahawk? ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, I can't help if I was born a predator. Rah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oh, Potty. I guess you're right. Can you ever forgive me? Shake. ,[Potty bites his fingers], Oh! Oh! Oh! ,[groans],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Now I can. Rah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oh, get out of here! ,[chuckles as he pulls out a really long telescope], Yep! Whoosh! ,[dips the telescope in the water, laughs, and sees SpongeBob and the gang throwing Sandy a birthday party in Jellyfish Fields], Oh, oh, yeah! I'm gonna save these mental pictures for me grandkids. ,[chuckles and peeks through the telescope with his other eye], Oh, that's better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob gives Sandy a birthday cake.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone:, ♪Squirrelly birthday, dear Sandy, squirrelly birthday to you♪ ,[cheering], Hooray!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Y'all are the best aquatic critter friends a lone star from out of town could ever have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Cake time! ,[pounds on the table],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Wah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy's birthday cake flies into Patrick's mouth. Patrick swallows the cake whole and licks the icing off his face.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[gives Sandy another cake], Don't worry. I always carry a spare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick goes to pound the table again.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Oh, no you don't! ,[lifts the cake in the air], Hoo-hah! Karate slice! Hi-yah! ,[karate chops the cake into pieces for her friends],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Enjoy the cake, everybody. I made it special just for Sandy. ,[eats the cake], Mm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I'm allergic to nuts. Are there any nuts in that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Nope, no nuts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, okay. ,[eats the cake],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh," unless you count """"wall nuts.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, What? ,[his face swells up],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I'm pretty sure walnuts are a fruit though, huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward groans. Pearl, Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff eat their slices of the cake. Mr. Krabs goes to give Mrs. Puff a piece of his cake.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mrs. Puff:, Mmm!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[All of a sudden, the ground shakes.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mrs. Puff:, Whoa—oh—oh—oh—oh! ,[Mr. Krabs accidentally pokes Mrs. Puff in the eye with his fork],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Larry does some weight-lifting while eating some cake.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Larry:, ,[feels the ground shaking], Huh? Whoa! ,[falls over],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[feels the ground shaking], Whoa! ,[falls over and gets up], Tex Ritter! You don't see that everyday. ,[she runs over to a volcano, but as she gets closer, a spooky, green-glowing moon comes out from the top], Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone:, Ooh! Pretty!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Larry:, Last time I saw a moon that big, it was in a locker room. ,[chuckles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Since when is the moon so green?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[chuckles and munches on some cake], Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese, SpongeBob. ,[swallows some cake], It's just been up there so long, it's getting moldy. ,[his pupils turn green], Oh, but I'd still eat it. ,[eats some more cake],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, That ain't the moon, guys. The real moon comes out at night, remember? Something's fishy going on here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dad:, ,[laughs as he plays ball with his family], Attagirl, Sissy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daughter:, I got it, Dad!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, Look out, Mom!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mable-Monica:, Hey, kids, check out that cool, glowing rock in the sky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The green moon flies over the family. However, something unexpected happened. When the green moon's light touches them, their bodies glow green and one by one, they transform into realistic fish. Then they eat the ball.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, You don't see that everyday. Did you see that, SpongeBob? Sponge...Bob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[All of Sandy's friends are completely brainwashed by the green moon's light. The green moon flies over Frankie Billy, who is flying a kite.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frankie Billy:, Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The green moon transforms Frankie Billy into a realistic trout. Then he eats his kite. Sandy gasps and rubs her eyes in shock.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[both chanting], Green cheese! Green cheese! Green cheese!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The green moon flies over SpongeBob and Patrick and they both transform into realistic sea creatures. SpongeBob is transformed into a realistic sea sponge while Patrick is transformed into a realistic starfish.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, SpongeBob? Patrick? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick crawl around, eating little bugs in the grass; Sandy gasps and runs towards her friends], Everyone listen to me! Get away from the light! The light is bad! Run for the shade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[But it was too late. Sandy's friends completely immobilized by the green moon and they won't move an inch.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mrs. Puff:, So romantic. ,[shoves Mr. Krabs in the shoulder],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh-ho!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mrs. Puff:, Eugene-ikins, give me some sugar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, I'm always a sucker for a good smooch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[But before they kiss, the green moon flies over them and it transforms them into realistic sea creatures. Mr. Krabs is transformed into a realistic crab while Mrs. Puff is transformed into a realistic puffer fish. Mr. Krabs pinches Mrs. Puff in the lips with his claw. Mrs. Puff puffs up and sends Mr. Krabs flying to a coral reef. Mr. Krabs crawls underneath the coral reef to hide.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, ,[talking to one of her friends on the phone], Yeah, walk outside and check out this awesome moon. ,[takes a picture with her phone],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The green moon flies over Pearl and it transforms her into a realistic sperm whale.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phone:, Hello? Hello, Pearl?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Pearl swallows her phone. Larry is looking at the green moon while doing some weight-lifting. The green moon flies over Larry and it transforms him into a realistic lobster. It looks as though if Sandy is the only sole survivor of the green moon's effect. The green moon slowly turns its light towards Sandy.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, No! Not me! ,[screams as the light passes over her, but to her surprise, the green moon doesn't seem to effect her at all], Huh? I guess it only effects sea creatures, but I still don't get why that green moon is turning everyone into wild swimming fish? ,[gasps], Am I the only one left?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy hears a toilet flushing from the restrooms. It turns out that the only friend who hasn't been transformed under the effects of the green moon is Squidward. He had quietly slipped away to the restrooms while Sandy's attention was on the green moon.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, whoever used that restroom last was an animal! ,[Sandy grabs Squidward just before the green moon can get him], Hey, put me down! Sandy! What are you doing? Ow! That hurts! ,[Sandy shoves Squidward under a rock to protect him from the green moon; he groans], What is the meaning of—,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Get in the shade! ,[shoves Squidward underneath with her foot just as the green moon flies by],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I demand an explanation!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, I'm getting one right now, Squidward! ,[dials a number on her communicator],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The communicator contacts the French Narrator, who is traveling in a submarine.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
French Narrator:, ,[answers the phone], Hello? French Narrator speaking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Hey, Frenchy! It's me, Sandy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
French Narrator:, Ah, Sandy Cheeks. ,[holds up a picture of Sandy], How is it hanging?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Oh, it's not hanging too good, Frenchy. You see, there's this—,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
French Narrator:, Don't say another word. I have been monitoring the behavior of the green moon all day. It is called Neptune's Moon. Every 100 years, it de-evolves everyone in Bikini Bottom into primal fish for two hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Two hours?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
French Narrator:, Until it falls into another volcano and is extinguished. ,[gives a demonstration of Neptune's Moon and his experiment splatters green goo on his helmet],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, I knewed it was nature, dagnabit! That's a relief. So I just have to keep Squidward in the shade for a couple of hours. ,[Squidward becomes easily frightened when he sees wild fish eating each other], Whew! Thanks, Frenchy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[screams and crawls out from under the rock], I'm going home to hide under the covers! It's every cephalopod for himself! ,[he idiotically runs toward Neptune's Moon],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[gasps], Frenchy, I gotta call you back! ,[runs after Squidward], Squidward, you have to stay in the shade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward trips and falls over. He is cornered by a carnivorous fish.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[screams], Help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Squidward! No!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Just as the carnivorous fish was about the eat Squidward, Neptune's Moon flies over Squidward and it transforms him into a realistic giant octopus. Squidward eats the fish and rushes towards Sandy.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, O.M. Jehoshaphat! You don't see that everyday. ,[dodges Squidward's tentacle and hops on the jellyfish], My friends are gonna be lunch if I don't think fast! ,[gets stung, jumps down, and grabs a net; Squidward destroys the picnic table], SpongeBob! Patrick! ,[scoops up SpongeBob and Patrick with the net], Mrs. Puff! Mr. Krabs! ,[scoops up Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs with the net], Larry! ,[picks up Larry; Mr. Krabs pinches Sandy's tail with his claw], Yeeouch! ,[throws Larry in the net and runs toward Pearl], Look out, Pearl! I'll save you! Yee-ha! ,[jumps onto Pearl's tailfin; Squidward nearly bites Sandy, but Pearl manages to swim away; Sandy laughs in relief now that her friends are safe], Like busting a bronco! Yee-ha! ,[Pearl swims away from Jellyfish Fields; Sandy rips the net off the stick and holds it by her tail; Pearl breaks the Bikini Bottom sign as she continues swimming], Whoa—oh—oh—oh! ,[Pearl flips her tail, causing Sandy to tumble towards the blowhole], Not the blowhole! ,[Sandy falls in the blowhole; Pearl blasts Sandy out and send her crashing underneath a flying airplane; the passengers and crew of the plane are transformed into realistic fish due to the effects of Neptune's Moon; Sandy falls on Pearl's back and the plane crashes offscreen, killing the passengers and crew onboard; Pearl then swims over Bikini Bottom, where the citizens are looking directly at Neptune's Moon], Hey! Everybody! The light is bad! Stay away from the light!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highway Speed Officer:, License and registration, please?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Nat Peterson takes out his driver's license. Just as the officer was going to write up a ticket, Neptune's Moon flies over them and transformed Nat and the officer into realistic fish. Pearl swims away from Bikini Bottom and swims towards the surface.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Hold your breath, creatures!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[On the surface, Patchy sees Pearl heading straight towards him through his telescope.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Uh-oh! ,[panicked screams], Whale! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! ,[rows his boat out of Pearl's way; Pearl leaps over Patchy and Potty and jumps back into the ocean, splashing water into Patchy's boat], Oh! Oh, Potty! We're taking on water! ,[starts bailing water], A little help here, please, Potty? ,[Potty splashes Patchy with a bucket of water], Oh! Get out of here, you fiendish feather duster! Shoo! Shoo! I said, shoo! I'll do it meself. I don't need your help. I'm perfectly fine doing it by meself. ,[continues bailing water],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Pearl swims downward from the surface and swims over Bikini Bottom. Then she swims toward's Sandy's treedome.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[screams], Here's where we get off! ,[Pearl drops Sandy and her friends off at the treedome and Sandy jumps off her back], Thanks for the lift, Pearl! Don't you worry. Nobody's going to eat you guys on my watch. ,[Mr. Krabs pinches Sandy's hand with his claw], Ow! ,[inside her treedome, Sandy puts SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff and Larry in a little aquarium; she feeds them fish food], Dinner time!

SpongeBob:, Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, ,[with a crown on], Meow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Good night, magic pencil. ,[Falls asleep. DoodleBob's arm goes into SpongeBob's house, it starts going up the stairs and takes a bathroom break, finally he sneaks up to SpongeBob's bed, grabs the pencil, and starts to re-draw himself. He wakes up], Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water? ,[laughs], ,[DoodleBob pops up in his bed; SpongeBob screams], DoodleBob! ,[slightly chuckles], No hard feelings, right? ,[DoodleBob draws two angry eyebrows on his face and jumps on SpongeBob's bed holding the pencil threateningly], ,[screams], What do you think you're doing, doodle?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DoodleBob:, You Doodle! Me SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob screams and jump out of the ways as DoodleBob erases his pillow, then part of SpongeBob's house whilst chasing him, they chase downstairs.

SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen? ,[DoodleBob erases his nose], I nose. ,[DoodleBob erases some parts of his face and body, DoodleBob laughs at the way he looks now], Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn. ,[When SpongeBob and DoodleBob struggle, the pencil breaks into two. SpongeBob has the lead and draws the rest of his face and body back], Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw. ,[DoodleBob sharpens the pencil with his mouth. He now has both sides], You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. ,[the lead piece flies out of his hand, crashes through the window and hits Squidward],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[offscreen], Ouch! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Or maybe it was most clumsy. ,[DoodleBob starts to attack him again as SpongeBob hides in a bookshelf, as DoodleBob approaches him, he gets his foot stuck in a piece of paper on the floor, DoodleBob sees this and tries to get it off], Huh? ,[SpongeBob looks in a book], Paper! ,[DoodleBob tosses the pencil from his hand], Page for Mr. Doodle! ,[Smashes him with a notebook. SpongeBob watches as DoodleBob is preserved as a drawing, when it was all over, he smiles. The next day, SpongeBob hangs the piece of paper on the wall with a push-pin],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Take a look for yourself, Patrick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[Gasp!], It's the evil Doodle!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose. ,[he blows from a pipe],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, So... he's a drawing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Exactly! See how happy he is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[He looks at the paper with DoodleBob on it], He still looks kind of creepy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Cut to outside. SpongeBob has just drawn a diving board. The pencil's broken halves have recently been taped together.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, O, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Ready! ,[SpongeBob drops the pencil into Patrick's mouth. SpongeBob jumps from the diving board and onto Patrick's chest, and the pencil is launched back to the surface. In the real world, the artist from earlier is curled up in a fetal position],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
French Narrator:, We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Artist:, ,[the pencil reaches the surface and lands on him], Huh? What's this? ,[he jumps up and holds his pencil in joy], My pencil! ,[he tries to draw, but unfortunately, the pencil lead breaks],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time. ,[Gary's pupils dilate], Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way, ,[zooms in on Gary's eyes], or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way... ,[Gary just stares], So that's how you wanna play it, huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch! ,[Throws the ball to Gary. Toy boomerangs back to SpongeBob and he reads the box]," Huh? """"New"""" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm.

Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language! ,[hangs up], Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee!

Squidward:, He's gone laughing tormentor. ,[SpongeBob continues to laugh but every few seconds, he gets an ache in his side and Squidward takes notice of this], This could be my chance. ,[enters kitchen], SpongeBob, you don't look well!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I don't?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No. You should sit down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[sticks a cooking thermometer in SpongeBob's mouth], Shh, shh, shh. ,[feels his forehead], You're burning up, SpongeBob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I am?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah, a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, And your temperature is 175 degrees!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It's that bad?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I have been laughing a lot, lately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[gasps], SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're gonna burn out your laugh box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, My laugh box?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Is that what happened to you, Squidward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again. ,[scene fades to Sandy walking up to Patrick],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Hey, Patrick, you wanna hear a joke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Sure, Sandy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[in a lung capacity machine], Sure, I'd love a good laugh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck! ,[Sandy and Patrick laugh normally while SpongeBob's laugh is robotic. Sandy and Patrick giggle nervously and backs away slowly],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I don't wanna burn out my laugh box, Squidward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, How long do I have to avoid laughing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you! ,[later SpongeBob is walking out of the Krusty Krab], A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant. ,[looks over to his right], Nothing funny over there. ,[looks over to his left], Nothing funny over here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[notices banana peel in front of Patrick on the ground], Patrick, banana peel, don't!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, What'd you say? ,[slips on banana peel],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, no. ,[stifles laughter],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hey, what the... ,[slips on banana peel again],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wait a minute, Patrick! ,[Patrick slips on the banana peel again], Please stop!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Right foot first...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, You can't? Oh, I know what to do! ,[flaps his lips and SpongeBob runs away], That usually knocks him out. ,[continues flapping his lips then slips on the banana peel again],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[runs behind a building], Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control. ,[steps on a whoopee cushion], Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob. ,[steps on another whoopee cushion. He gasps], They're everywhere. Everywhere!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delivery Fish:, Look out for that pie truck! ,[pie truck crashes into the whoopee cushion truck. SpongeBob laughs a little as the big pie on top of the truck falls on the driver],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I gotta get outta here. ,[runs out of the Bikini Bottom city limits], There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe... ,[digs himself a hole to bury himself in. He gets in. Now only his nose is seen. He stays there as the day turns to night, then it is morning and a clam crows like a rooster], Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing. ,[tries to laugh, but wheezes instead], That's odd. ,[wheezes again, with a weird deflating sound], I've lost my laugh. ,[screams and runs back into Bikini Bottom], I've lost my laugh! ,[screams again, then knocks on Patrick's rock],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, What happened?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Let me take a look. ,[inserts his head into SpongeBob's mouth], Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match. ,[lights a match. Smoke fills SpongeBob and Patrick can't get him off his head so he runs around screaming. Later, at the Krusty Krab],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Come in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[crying], Mr. Krabs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What's wrong, boy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I lost my laugh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh. ,[both look at money but only Mr. Krabs laughs], Don't it just tickle you, boy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Not really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[touches money], Nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist. ,[later at Sandy's treedome],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[pulls down a chart of the body], But scientifically speaking, it's caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Sounds painful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob. ,[hands SpongeBob a bunch of books], Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Thank you, Sandy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again. ,[moans and groans into his pineapple],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy. ,"[laughs. """"Later that same evening timecard is shown and the French narrator reads it]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Narrator:, Later that same evening...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[is playing clarinet when he hears SpongeBob crying], I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon. ,[SpongeBob cries tears on the side of Squidward's house and night turns into day as Squidward's house plugs up its ears], What have I done? ,[SpongeBob cries a river into Squidward's house causing it to flood him outside], Oh, that's it! This charade has to end. ,[realizes his feet are underwater and walks to SpongeBob's house. He knocks on SpongeBob's door and lots of tears come out],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box! ,[sprays a fountain of tears into Squidward's face. Squidward puts his tentacles over SpongeBob's eyes, stopping the tears],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, (taken aback by the revelation) Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I could laugh the whole time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yeah. ,[both laugh], You really fell for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I guess I did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine. ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[stops laughing], It's really not that funny, Squidward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, It's hilarious!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, See ya later, Squidward. ,[goes into his house],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[still laughing], Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel. ,[his laughter turns to coughing as his sides started aching], yahhhh! ,[Squidward inhales deeply and lets out a long cough, (thus losing his laughter) and falls flat to the ground, while two paramedics come take him to the hospital],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Look, he's waking up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, (groans) Where am I?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, So they cut it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Cut it out?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Yeah, wanna see it? ,[holds up jar with Squidward's laugh box in it], It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[screams], Gimme! Oh. I can never laugh again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doctor:, Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, But, you cut out my laugh box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doctor:, Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, They wouldn't pay me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, You're getting warmer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[SpongeBob shows his scar], SpongeBob? ,[laughs like SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hey, you laugh just like me. ,[both laugh. Squidward laughs too much so he runs through the wall], Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world. ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Gary notices his food bowl is empty. So, he slithers up to the diving board, jumps off, and starts to lick SpongeBob, who giggles and wakes up],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gary! What are you doing!?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say ,[rushes to get food], organic!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow? ,[raspberries],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, There you go, Gary! ,[Gary sniffs it and rejects the food. He slithers over to a fungus growing on the floor, smiles, and eats some], Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, ,[Mocking], Meow, meow, meow... ,[SpongeBob attempts to clean it, but to no avail],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off! ,[The doorbell rings], Ooh! Company! ,[itches his head as he answers the door],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob! Eww! ,[gasps],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Is something wrong, Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, SpongeBob! What is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, This! ,[bends SpongeBob's head over so he can see the fungus on his head],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, [Screams] P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Good idea! ,[He does so],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Uhh, SpongeBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I don't know about this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What makes you say that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, This.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[He takes out a mirror and shows SpongeBob that the fungus has spread],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger! ,[gulps], Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure! ,[He spreads some on], Aah. That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Sure do! Well, Probably gonna go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Bye, Patrick! ,[Patrick leaves, and SpongeBob goes and takes a shower. He lathers the soap into an anchor shape, and when he rinses, the fungus is in an anchor shape], Ahh… This feels better! ,[doing a crossword], Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm… ,[He feels an itch], Itch! ,[Starts scratching his head; cuts to the Krusty Krab], Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually. ,[As he says this, a piece of fungus comes down onto his nose. He flings it onto the wall, but another one grows, so he pushes his nose in], There! Outta sight, outta mind! ,[sees the fungus on the wall, scoops it up, and tries to throw it away, but it sticks], I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking! ,[puts on gloves from a first aid kit], Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching! ,[Squidward comes in],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, SpongeBob! ,[screams and sees SpongeBob scratching the fungus], SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, All what-y?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all! ,[His nose pops out with the fungus, and Squidward screams. He jumps to the top of the cabinet],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, That's no blemish!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Help… Me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, I'll help you, alright! ,[takes out a phone],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S.W.A.T. fish #1:, S.W.A.T. Team. ,[Gibberish on the other end], We'll be right over! ,[The team breaks through the ceiling of the Krusty Krab and slide down ropes from a helicopter],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S.W.A.T. fish #2:, Hold it right there! Neptune's trident! This is the most severe case of Ick yet. ,[tries to touch SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S.W.A.T. fish #3:, Stop, you fool! ,[smacks other fish's hand away], Do you wanna get infected? This is a job for the hazmat physician.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hazmat physician:, Get back! I said, get back! Back I say! ,[pushes SpongeBob into a cage, which is promptly lifted by a helicopter],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What's going on, Squidward? Help! ,[As the helicopter flies away, a piece of fungus attaches itself to Squidward. Later, at the cash register],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[to Old Man Jenkins], Here's your change, sir. ,[As he hands him the coins, some fungus gets on the old man. He puts them in his pockets, then readjusts his glasses, which leaves fungus all over his nose],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old Man Jenkins:, Oh, why thank you very much, young man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, What was that? No, no, Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick. ,[starts scratches himself],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob, being completely covered in fungus, is encased in a bubble with tubes coming from it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Where am I? Whoa! ,[Doctors are talking to each other], Who are you people? I wanna go home! ,[A scientist walks up towards SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scientist:, You are home, SpongeBob. You just have to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Where's my snail, Gary?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scientist:, We've taken care of your pet. ,[Gary is encased in a bubble similar to SpongeBob's],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gary? Whoa! ,[notices someone scanning him],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hazmat Physician:, He appears stable, sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scientist:, Alright, boys, let's pack it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The scientists leave, scene cuts to outside SpongeBob's pineapple house, covered in a plastic bag, with police tape and barbed wire around it," with a board written """"Quarantine"""" on it. SpongeBob is filter-feeding", when Patrick walks in],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Wow! ,[bumps into the bubble], Huh? What is this? ,[pokes],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Really? How about if I squeeze it like this? ,[squeezes it, SpongeBob gasps], Or this? ,[bites it, SpongeBob gasps again], Or this? ,[digs cleats into it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Sure! Let's begin! ,[They take out hooks and tear up the bubble], Um... Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I win! I win! I win!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Patrick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,"[starts dancing around and doing the """"Worm""""]", Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[stands and gets Patrick's attention as he stops dancing], Patrick! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I've got an idea! ,[He pulls out bubble soap and begins to blow a bubble around SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! Huh?,[notices the bubble], Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile! ,[wheels it around a little], Now I can go back to work! ,[puts on his hat. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Squidward is scratching],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! Help! ,[pulls Squidward through the window into the kitchen], Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[shakes his head, and gets Ick all over the food], No, no, no, no, no, no, no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh… If only SpongeBob were here…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in Ick! ,[scratches, oblivious to the fact that he has Ick all over him, too], Lunch is served! ,[gives Ick Patties to a couple], Eat up, kids. ,[The kids bite into their Ick kid's meal, and as everyone bites into their food, Squidward scratches all over],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nathiel Waters:, ,[drinks from an Ick milkshake, he has an ick mustache and beard afterwards], Ahh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[now completely green], Oh, why am I so itchy? ,[gets some on the wall and sees that he has the fungus], Oh no. ,[screams and all the customers look at him], SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people! ,[An angry mob forms around Squidward], Stay back, you diseased freaks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs, covered in the ick, slams opens the door on Squidward], What's all the commotion about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unknown Fish:, ,[With accent], The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Inadequate!? I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free. ,[door opens and Mr. Krabs is awestruck],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Everybody turns to SpongeBob in his bubble, who has swollen up to an enormous green circle. He puts on his hat, and squirts green juice inside his bubble. The fish gasp],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unknown Fish:, Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, We are!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab! ,[everybody growls and screams],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unknown Fish:, Let us apprehend that careless contaminator! ,[All the fish attack SpongeBob, who starts crying, making a huge puddle in his bubble. Outside the Krusty Krab, Gary slithers into the dumpster and eats a can, which he coughs up. His stomach growls as he slithers out],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow. ,[sees SpongeBob inside getting attacked by the Krusty Krab fish],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[crying], ,[the fish body slam SpongeBob's bubble, which make holes that the Ick leaks through], Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick! ,[the unknown fish the other fish make a final body slam], NOOOOO! ,[All the fish slam into it, and it pops, splattering Ick all over the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs starts laughing],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, It's not me, Mr. Krabs! ,[Gary is crawling all over Mr. Krabs, sucking all the fungus off him],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission? ,[We see Gary clean the Ick off of Mr. Krabs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid! ,[Gary sucks the fungus off Squidward, next],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nat Peterson:, Oh! Oh! Me next!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Martha Smith:, Where are your manners? It's ladies first!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I believe the expression is starfish first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unknown Fish:, I supersede all of you! For I have an exotic accent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with. ,[Later…], Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars! ,[The first fish steps up, and Gary cleans him],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Now can I get you a Krabby Patty? ,[The guy whacks him with his glove],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unknown Fish:, In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive. ,[pulls out money], I'll take two, please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Alright! ,[SpongeBob is next. He hands Krabs the money],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Here you go, Mr. Krabs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Another 5 dollars for another de-Ickin'. ,[Gary cleans SpongeBob off],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work! ,[Gary burps loudly, then smiles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Squidward's and Patrick's houses at dusk.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Batter up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob rolls in a little stove with pots, pans, a whisk, and a bowl. He pours pancake mix into the bowl and cracks two eggs. He mixes them up and puts the batter on the pan.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[flips the pancakes], Ah, oh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick throws the pan and SpongeBob swings his own pan to hit it like he was playing baseball.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, I got it, I got it! ,[falls on the ground as the pancakes land on his plate],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[sticks out his tongue], Wah! ,[eats one pancake],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick slurps down on the pancakes and the two friends give each other a high-five.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Whoo-hoo!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, Best friends?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones. ,[flashback to Krabs and Plankton as babies],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Goo! ,[Krabs laughs, then puts Plankton on his crib mobile],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone:, Aw!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[Cut to flashback of Mr. Krabs' third birthday. There's a birthday cake reading """"Big Boys"""". Krabs sticks out his tongue to get Plankton to blow out the candles]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Things were all peaches and creams. ,[Plankton blows out the candles then jumps in the cake. Bubble transition to elementary school], Until we hit grade school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kid Mr. Krabs:, Hey, Planky, whatcha doing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kid Plankton:, Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out. ,[a spitball hits Plankton in the back of his head. Class bullies laugh], Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away. ,[muffled explosion. Plankton's container blew up all over his table and covers him in ashes. Classmates laugh. Billy, the ringleader of the hooligans and the same who shot Plankton with a spitball, grabs him],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000? ,[He stuffs Plankton into his straw and blows him out like a spitball. He splatters into Mr. Krabs's eye.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kid Plankton:, ,[moaning in pain], They'll pay for this one day, Eugene!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[peeling off squished Plankton], Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry. Sorry you have to hang out with Rag Boy. ,[bullies laugh],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #2:, Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping? The trash can? ,[the bullies laugh again. Krabs is on the verge of breaking down into tears.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash. ,[flashback ends], You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... ,[sniffles],....fashion me clothes from rags.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[flashback to Krabs' mother sewing up clothes],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mama Krabs:, There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old Man Jenkins:, Oops. ,[rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes and uses it as a rag to dry his boat], I missed a spot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Krabs and Plankton are walking through the carnival grounds, with Plankton conversing with him. Krabs has a box around his body],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kid Mr. Krabs:, What in Neptune's name is that? ,[picks up a penny off the ground], It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kid Plankton:, It's money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Moneyyyyyyyyyy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Yeah. You can buy things with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kid Mr. Krabs:, Buy things?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:,  So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton. ,[Mr Krabs buys a balloon for Plankton, but when he gives it to Plankton, he flies up into the sky because of his weight. Krabs reaches up, looking desperate],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, Wow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. ,[shoves it away with a pencil],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SWAT Fish #4:, So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Yeah. I really wanna know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Listen up," Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called """"Stinky Burgers"""". It was the only place to get a burger. The kids loved Stinky's. ",[a group of kid regulars (Billy and his gang) run up clamoring], And Stinky loved the kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stinky:, Now, what can I do for you young 'uns?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one Stinky Burger, please!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #3:, Me, too, Stinky!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stinky:, Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone. ,[they all cheer],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Big Johnny:, That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #5:, We don't like Stinky, we respect him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stinky:, Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like me or respect me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Big Johnny:, Like!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #5:, Respect!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Big Johnny:, Like!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #5:, Respect!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stinky:, Okay, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me. ,[they cheer again],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Excuse us!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Valuable customers coming through.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Big Johnny (in Billy's voice):, What are those dorks doing here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Two Stinky Burgers, please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stinky:, ,[Stinky makes weird faces], Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, Yeah, Stinky!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, Thanks for keeping the nerds out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #2:, You're the best, Stinky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stinky:, Okay, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy. ,[Mr. Krabs is knocking on the door in the back of the building. Stinky opens up the door, he makes weird faces again], Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li... ,[his watch beeps], Is it quitting time already? ,[rips off his clothes to reveal some nicer clothes underneath], Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials. ,[gets in his limo and moves the stack of cash over on the seat. As he closes the door and drives off, a dollar flies into Mr. Krabs' hand],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot. ,[cash register dings as Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into dollar bill signs], But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school! ,[laughs. Patchy reappears],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met. ,[Patchy shows a picture of him as a young pirate and holding Potty's egg in his hands], If I could only hear his voice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Less talking and more working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, ,[gasps], Potty! You came back to apologize!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, I came to tell you to get back to work!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Oh, a thing called the G.E.D., man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oh, here we go again with the fancy booklearnin'. Customers love me cookin. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Customer throws up the food in a doggy bag and the customer's face turns green like a zombie],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oh, Potty, what am I doing wrong?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, You just need some practice, that's all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patchy flips burgers and stuff, then, we see Patchy looking through a microscope, and sees mini burger bacteria cells, then he laughs, and coughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Ahh, me patty's done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oh, Fine. I'll eat it! ,[Patchy eats it and then smiles, frowns and spits it out], Oh, for the crime of befouling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank! ,[Patchy watches as the burger on a string jumps of the plank into the trash], Ah. Oh, well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Brawk, roll film. ,[SpongeBob is shown as a baby and he makes a Krabby Patty perfectly], A perfect patty on the first try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, You're unsanitary, Patchy, You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Well, that's what gives it its special flavor. ,[Patchy puts a small piece of hamburger meat on top and sparkles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, You've got rats in the kitchen!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess? ,[Rat bites him], Ow! Mmmm! Don't do that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, What? Every time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:," The same kind who wears a """"Kiss the Cook"""" apron.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh? ,[Patchy winks four times],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Now I feel sick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patchy starts flipping patties at Potty],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[when Potty flies away, Patchy flips one in Mr. Pirateson's face],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Now you've done it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Pirateson:, ,[He removes the patty from his face], Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Yes, Mr. Pirateson. ,[Potty flies into his office], You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Pirateson:, Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[cut to Mr. Krabs and Plankton walking by the dump],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress. ,[Mr. Krabs and Plankton work together to make a burger and go through the steps of doing so],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Gently. Gently. ,[holds up the burger on a platter],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant. ,[Mr. Krabs and Plankton turned a trailer in the dump into a restaurant. Mr. Krabs cut the 'grand opening' tape while Plankton pushed a button to signal for customers. A line of customers line up in front of the restaurant], Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please. ,[the kid gives his dollar for a burger],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, There you are, sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fish Kid:, Hey! Your burger's even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, I thought it was our recipe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds! ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, But what about satisfying the customer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world! ,[laughs again], And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Give me that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Stop! You're gonna bust it! ,[the recipe tears in half],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:," Which one? The one that says """"Eject"""" or the one that says """"Trap Door""""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Oh, either one will do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What I was saying was... ,[Plankton pulls a string that launches Mr. Krabs out of the restaurant], You'll regret this one day! ,[Mr. Krabs lands in the trash. Flashback to present], And he always did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, ,[pops out of the pepper shaker], Lies! ,[SpongeBob is about to swallow the formula again, but Mr Krabs takes it and puts it in his back pocket],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Very touching, but completely false.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Don't know what you mean.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Why don't you tell them the truth?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory. ,[flashback again to restaurant. Mr. Krabs laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, First, I'll rule their stomachs and then... ,[laughs], ...their money! ,[Mr. Krabs laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, But what about satisfying the customers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Barnacles to the customers! ,[Plankton gasps], I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Gimme that! ,[both try to take the formula],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Stop, you're gonna bust it. ,[formula tears in half],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, This isn't about money, Eugene.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Malarkey. ,[Mr. Krabs puts Plankton in a straw and spits him out],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, You'll regret this one day! ,[lands in a pile of trash], Ouch. ,[emerges and looks at the half of his recipe], Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, That's because it isn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, & Plankton:, Karen?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, It was only our third date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks. ,[flashback on Karen's computer screen],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Now that's a handsome looking burger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You said it, old chum. ,[over intercom], Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here! ,[a tumbleweed rolls by], Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump? ,[music is playing in the background],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, What's that music?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins! ,[Old Man Jenkins puts a tire in his boat],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old Man Jenkins:, I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old Man Jenkins:, Why, I'd be happy to! ,[bites into the burger then smiles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs & Plankton:, Yeah! ,[Old Man Jenkins falls over. Later, a newspaper appears on screen],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:," """"Plab Patties KO's Old Man J"""". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Well, he is old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Hey. That guy is like family to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, No way, that recipe's mine! ,[both fight over the recipe],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Stop, you're gonna... ,[recipe tears in half, sending both into opposite sides of the restaurant. Plankton walks out], You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget! ,[slams the door causing a shelf, above the boiling patty, to spill the jars into the cauldron],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything. ,[licks some of the patty mix], I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone. ,"[Plankton puts a Chum Bucket bucket with meat in it while Mr. Krabs wheels in """"Krabby Patties"""" and knocks him over]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I think not, Rag Boy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, What?! Why I oughta squash you right now! You little...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Get out of my face! ,[both growl at each other],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #3:, Hey, look! Nerd fight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, Big Johnny will eat anything. ,[Big Johnny walks over to Plankton's side],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir. ,[Johnny eats it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think! ,[Big Johnny spits the burger out on both his friends],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty. ,[hands him a patty. He takes a bite and instantly enjoys it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Billy:, Flavor!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #5:, Edible!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bully #'s 2 and 6:, We can actually hold it down!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abigail-Marge:, This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All:, Yay, Rag Boy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop ‘til I do! ,[flashback ends],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You callin' me a liar?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship! ,[both tear up],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, I'd like that, Planky, old chum. ,[both hug and cry],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, I suppose it would. If I had one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Me, too. Me, too. ,[Plankton grabs the formula from Mr. Krabs' back pocket],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Now, Karen! ,[Karen grabs the formula], Back off, Rag Boy! ,[jumps on the formula and Karen wheels off],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[Gasp!], Sabotage!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Go, Karen! ,[everyone chases each other outside. Patchy reappears],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Ohh, that Plankton never learns, does he, kids? As for me, I decided to take some time off to catch up on me reading. ,[He holds up a newspaper that reads the word JOBS on the front],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Hey, you got fired, too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, I got a golden parachute.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Potty shines the light of his parachute, the outside of the resturaunt glows],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Well, at least I know they'll never ever be able to replace me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Potty:, ,[squawk], Looks like they already did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patchy gasps when he sees a gorilla],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, What? They let a smelly, hairy, fleabag like that serve food?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gorilla:, Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Hey, watch it, ape.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Gorilla throws food ingredients at Patchy],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Watch the patch! Ow! Ow! No! Please!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gorilla:, Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh...!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patchy:, Ooh! I have a tomato allergy! Ow, right in the buns!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Narrator:, And so, kids, always remember to follow your dreams. Unless you're Patchy, then just stay in bed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plankton:, ,[spins with the faucet and flies off], Wah! ,[crashes into a bouquet of roses, making petals fly all over.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Karen:, ,[relaxing in the tub with mud as Plankton massages her wheels], Oh, Sheldon. You're so romantic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, It's all about you today, Karen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, I need Krabs to play pretend tomorrow and fool my grandma into believing I'm the new owner, otherwise she will think I'm a big loser. Got it? ,[throws away the arrow],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[his face spins after Plankton finishes, but stops it on time], Well, I believe you, Plankton, but I'm not sure Mr. Krabs is gonna buy it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Krabs:, I ain't buying it! This whole grandma thing sounds just like another phony plot to steal me formula.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this, Eugene, but... ,[rips his body open to reveal his sweet, innocent self inside; his innocent side whimpers with his eye wide open],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], SpongeBob, there's something wrong with his eye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, That's Plankton's rarely seen sincere face, Mr. Krabs, and it means for once he is telling the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, Oh, uh... great. Yeah. ,[opens the book], Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it. ,[while eating a cookie, Patrick bites his finger leaving a big red bruise],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[acting like a 2-year old], D'oh! My wittle finger! ,[sobs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Hold still, hold still. ,[kisses his finger], All better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, ,[talking normally], Sorta.... ,[holds up his other finger], this finger hurts a little bit too. ,[SpongeBob is angry at what he sees then covers himself with the book he was reading],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, How about I give you a present? ,[SpongeBob then uncovers himself and sees Patrick with the present],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies! ,[opens up the box, then the box cover lands on SpongeBob's head to find a sweater, but puts it on his head], Alright, another hat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, No, Patrick, it's a sweater.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[Removes the box cover from his head], Huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, With love in every stitch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No... ,[imagines himself in the sweater instead of Patrick. The sweater tears in half], Don't I get a present, Grandma?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Oh, I almost forgot. ,[hands him some office supplies], Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind. ,[cuckoo clock strikes three again], Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick gets the sweater on], I'll bet you'd fancy a nap, huh, Patrick? ,[Patrick yawns], You still here, SpongeBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, ,[puts a blanket over Patrick as he lays on the couch], No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Yep, that is it. Here I go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Come again if you get the chance. ,[SpongeBob opens the door],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Toodleloo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I don't know when I'll be back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, I know how busy you are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, So, uh... that's it. ,[Patrick is sleeping],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Shh, he's asleep. ,[SpongeBob slowly closes the door],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Soo long... ,[closes the door but then opens it with sad eyes. His sideburns fall off of his head. He starts throwing a big tantrum], I don't wanna grow up! ,[holds up a giant chocolate chip cookie and snaps it in half in front of his face], I want cookies! ,[holds up a giant baby bottle with milk inside]," and """"milkie""""! ",[wears a sweater], I want a sweater with love in the stitches! ,[runs around wearing a diaper with a blue pin on it as he's putting powder in the diaper]," I wanna wear """"diadies""""! ",[rides in a wagon], I wanna ride in my wagon! ,[holds his giant teddy bear], I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins! ,[rides his old rocking horse with a sailor hat on and a lollipop], I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey! ,[holds up his bruised finger], And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo! ,[wailing and falls the floor, slamming his fists on the floor. He then rolls like a wheel. Grandma is shocked and sad for him. SpongeBob, sitting, sprays his tears in his mouth. Grandma thinks for a second. SpongeBob continues sobbing hysterically as he ratchets like a lawn sprinkler, almost spinning around and sprays tears everywhere. He spins even faster and floods the whole house],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Take it easy, SpongeBob. ,[picks up the still-crying SpongeBob], SpongeBob. SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob continues sobbing. Grandma holds his lips, stopping SpongeBob's crying], You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles as he starts to feel a bit better], I don't?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, Of course not. ,[pulls the plug under the tears to drain it], No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo. ,[Grandma tickles SpongeBob, then kisses his forehead], And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult. ,[hands SpongeBob his sideburns and a chocolate chip cookie], Here you go. ,[SpongeBob puts on his sideburns and eats the cookie],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Thanks, Grandma. ,[bites the cookie], Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma:, No problem. ,[she hugs SpongeBob. Outside, Squidward and everyone else are laughing],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: How about a little more, Plankton, or has this old granny had enough for one night?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: Oh, that looks simply delightful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: Ration?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Uh, no, chocolate. Open up! ,(feeds the pudding to Grandma), You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me. ,(wipes off the pudding), There you are. There you are, darling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: Oh, Plankton. You always were my favorite granddaughter!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nurse,: Five minutes until bedtime, Mr. Plankton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nurse,: Five minutes, Mr. Plank...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: ,I heard you the first time!, Now, where were we? ,(Grandma is asleep), Grandma, don't forget your teeth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: ,(spits out teeth and coughs),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there. ,(Grandma is asleep), That's perfect! ,(puts the teeth in his mouth), ,Perfect!, ,(laughs evilly)," Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say """"No"""" to a helpless little grandma! ",(thinking. He is at the Krusty Krab. ',female voice), Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs,: Goodness, no! ,"(gives the formula to """"her"""") ",Here you are,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there., (laughs evilly as imagery fades) ',(Bubble transition),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: La-la, la-la, la-la! La-la, la-la, la-la! ,(playing in the bathtub. He shoots a squirt of water with his hands. The squirt of water goes through his holes at the top of his head then lands on the bar of soap), Yay! ,A direct hit!, ,(uses a bar of soap as a walkie-talkie), Threat neutralized, Captain. ... Roger. Over. ... Uh-huh. Right away, Captain. All hands, ,prepare to dive!, Repeat: ,prepare to di--, ,(Plankton, disguised as Grandma knocks on the door. He clears his throat), Hi, lady!  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: ,(female voice), Why, SpongeBob. Don't you recognize me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Ehh, not really...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: ,(gasps), Quick, come inside! ,(inside of the pineapple) ,Wow, my very own great-grammyma. Why have we never met?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... ,(stammers), I mean...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: I'm so glad you came back... ,(rubs his finger across Plankton's chin), ...Double-Great Grammyma. ,(Plankton pushes it away and shudders), You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy., (Bubble transitions over to Plankton wrapped up in a blanket on a couch) ,Okay, lean forward. ,(Plankton grumbles as he does so. SpongeBob puts a pillow behind his back) ,There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have. ,(Plankton does so but sinks into the pillow. He is yelling from it. SpongeBob reacts) ,How about we look through some old family photo albums?, (SpongeBob runs to get them but Plankton is still stuck in the pillow. Cuts to SpongeBob laughing) ,Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage. ,(a picture of flattened SpongeBob tied to a balloon) ,Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more ,recent ,affairs, like where you work, for instance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too... ,(shows stacks of photo albums) ...,but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation. ,(it is night which turns to morning. SpongeBob and Plankton are asleep. SpongeBob wakes up and exclaims. He looks happily at Plankton),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Great-Graaaaaaamyma...?                                                                              ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: ,Huh?!? ,Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life! I was dressed up as...! ,(looks up to see SpongeBob still looking happily at him) ,Holy mother of Neptune, it's true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Good morning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Uh, sounds delightful. ,(takes off glasses. evilly laughs), Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ,(puts on more lipstick. Bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking down the street),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see ,your ,life, remember?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Hmmmm... ,(flashback of Plankton),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... ,(stammers), I mean...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,:, (goes back to the present), No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Well, uh...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: ,(grabs Plankton by the arm and carries him), Come on, it'll be fun! ,"(Bubble transitions over to the place called """"Grandma's Tea House."""" SpongeBob drinks tea) ",Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Why, yes! ,(drinks the tea then spits it out on a coaster) How can you drink this dreck?! (all of the grandmas gasp) ,Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was," """"More"," please."""" ",(bubble transitions to other grandmas and SpongeBob knitting) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Nope. ,(he has his arms in a yarn circle),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Why are you not having fun?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: ,Why?! Because I don't knit, you nitwit! (his yarn circle gets pulled and so does he by a grandma),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf. ,(Plankton is knitted into a scarf. Bubble transitions over to Plankton and SpongeBob playing Canasta. Plankton puts down a Joker card with his cards the A of clubs, the two of spades, and the five of diamonds) ,Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great ,"Canasta """"masta""""! (Plankton takes his Joker card and rips it in half and throws it on the table) ",Grandma, you getting bored?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs. ,I could eat a village!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: ,(reacts) ,Would I? ,(laughs. Then laughs maniacally. He clears his throat) ,Uh, yeah, I would. ,(bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking to the front entrance of the Krusty Krab) ,Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Antenna... What?! No, I...!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,:, (laughs) ,Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and... ,(Squidward bursts open the front door holding a garbage bag) ,...Squidward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: ,AAAH!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward,: SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward,: Your what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: My great-grammyma! ,(points to Plankton but he's not there) ,She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward,: Right... ,(starts dumping the garbage in the trash can) ,SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day. ,(Plankton is hiding in the trash can. He gets a lot of garbage all over him. He starts coughing. SpongeBob walks over to the trash can),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Never mind. Just get me into the ,kitchen! ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: ,(cuts to him and Plankton walking in the kitchen) ,Well, here it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: ,At ,last!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Ha, ha, ha... What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Nothing, go ahead! ,(laughs menacingly. He pulls out a green balloon which is a decoy of him dressed as Grandma. He stretches it then blows it up) ,Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! ,(the balloon floats away and goes above Plankton who is checking under the dirty plates for the formula. The balloon lands in the drain of the sink),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I... ,(calls), Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dish-washing while I have the chance. ,(walks to the sink) ,The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is any leftover rubbish in the sink. ,(turns the garbage disposal on. The balloon starts ripping into a million pieces) ,Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma! ,(the balloon finishes ripping. Plankton looks up) ,Oh, I can't bear to look! ,(starts crying. Plankton thinks for a bit) ,Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a... ,like a balloon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a ,safe ,nearby, where I could rest and recover.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Well, there ,is, the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Why ,would ,he?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: ,(carries Plankton over to the safe. He opens the safe which is filled with coins and cash. He puts Plankton on top of a stack of cash), Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton:, Oh, I feel better already. ,(begins snoring),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Sweet dreams, Grammyma. ,(closes the safe. Plankton starts laughing menacingly. He gets up),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, for ,Mr. Krabs!, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...! ,(Grandma Plankton's teeth fall out) ,I'm just going to savor this moment, because for once in my life—for once in my life—I feel ,truly alive! (Grandma Plankton grabs her teeth),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: ,Plankton! (Plankton gasps. Grandma Plankton takes her glasses off his face) You've been a very naughty boy, Plankton!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: B-But-But-But I... ,(Grandma Plankton takes her wig off his head) ,Grandma, I can... ,(Grandma Plankton takes her dress off Plankton's body),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: I've been looking all over for this stuff!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plankton,: Grandma, I can explain!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: ,(grabs Plankton by his right antenna and drags him out of the kitchen) ,I'm sure you can. Plankton Jr., you know you always were a... ,(stops at one of SpongeBob's feet),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob,: Grandma? ,(gasps) ,You caught Plankton! Let me guess—trying to steal the secret formula, right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grandma Plankton,: Get out of my way, rapscallion! ,(SpongeBob does so) ,I've had enough foolishness for one day. ,(Plankton groans. Grandma Plankton drags him out of the Krusty Krab. The episode ends),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, All right, Science Scouts. One last check on supplies. We all need to be prepared for a campout on the moon. ,[points to SpongeBob], SpongeBob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[digs into his backpack and pulls out a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola], Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola. ,[pulls out a bubble wand], Bubble wand. ,[blows a bubble shaped like the Moon and pulls out a tank top], Mesh tank top. ,[purrs], And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Well, that's not what I had in mind when I said supplies. How 'bout you, Pearl?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, Oh. ,[digs in her bag and pulls out pom-poms], Pom-poms, ,[pulls out a megaphone and screams in SpongeBob's face], megaphone, and spirit! ,[jumps and shakes the treedome, knocking everyone over.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, Uh. Do you always have to rub it in my face that you're a cheerleader?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, ,[rubs pom-poms on Squidina's face], Yes I do! ,[blows raspberry],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Scouts, I don't think you cotton to what we're doin'. We're going to the moon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Bubble Bass shows his butt outside the treedome.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob, Pearl, & Squidina:, Eww!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bubble Bass:, Huh? ,[pulls up his pants], Mm! ,[scoffs and leaves],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, No, that moon. ,[points to the moon in the sky],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob, Pearl, & Squidina:, Ohh!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Squidina, what did you bring?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, ,[digs in her bag and pulls out a pair of glasses], Eyeglasses, ,[pulls out comic books], comic books, ,[pulls out action figures], and action figures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, Ugh, can a person be any nerdier?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I can. ,[holds up an ugly picture of himself],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, Ew!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Remember, Scouts, we're scientists. Let's behave like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob washes his tank top, hangs it on the clothes line and blows bubbles through the holes.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Science!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[grumbles and opens the door], Everyone on board for lift-off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidina and Pearl enter the tree. Pearl's enormous head gets stuck in the door and Sandy pushes her in.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, Ouch!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Let's go, Scout!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But I'm still waiting for my Krabby Patty delivery guy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy takes out her telescope and looks through it. The moon moves directly to the right spot where the X is.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, The moon is in perfect position for us to launch. ,[puts her telescope away], We gotta leave now! ,[grabs SpongeBob and drags him in her tree],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Outside the treedome, someone is ringing the doorbell. It turns out to be Squidward, who was supposedly delivering a Krabby Patty to SpongeBob.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Hello? Delivery. ,[grumbles and enters the treedome], Did someone order a Krabby Patty? ,[walks over to the picnic table and leaves the delivery there; he picks one of Sandy's records and looks at it], Uhh. Yuck. Hokey hoo-ha for hicks. ,[the treedome starts to shake and Squidward starts to panic], Ahh! I take it back! I could learn to like songs about tractors...maybe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy pushes some buttons on her control panel, which causes a shaking motion that scares her scouts.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Uh, sorry about that. Just some backfire is all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Safety first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidina and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. SpongeBob attempts to fasten his, but his seatbelt rolls back. He attempts to tie the seatbelt in a knot, but it unravels and slaps him in the face.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Uh, why you! ,[pulls his seatbelt up, but gets all tangled up in it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Uhh, everything okay back there, SpongeBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob gives Sandy a thumbs up after getting tangled up by his seatbelt. The seatbelt untangles him and flips him in his helmet. Sandy pulls out a lasso and ties SpongeBob down.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Three, two, one, launch! ,[pushes the lunch button and it flips over, revealing a sandwich, an apple, and a carton of milk], Whoops! Lunch. ,[pushes the launch button],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The treedome begins shaking and is about to launch into space. Squidward runs to the door and attempts to leave, but the vibration makes him fall over. The treedome, now redesigned as a rocket ship, blasts off from the ground and starts flying. Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob's faces distort as the rocket launches upward. SpongeBob laughs and Squidward's face distorts as well. Squidward crawls over to the dome's glass and sees Bikini Bottom getting smaller below him. The rocket emerges from the ocean, exits the Earth's stratosphere, and directly heads into outer space. Squidward panics, screams, and runs around like crazy. But suddenly, he starts floating since there is no gravity in space.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Eh, did I die? Am I a ghost? ,[screams as he floats around],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[turns off the rocket's engines], Okay, Scouts, you're free to move about the cabin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[starts floating], Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying! ,[his skirt falls down, revealing his underwear], Whoop! ,[covers his underwear and laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob's helmet falls off. Then SpongeBob's eyes, nose, and mouth fall off his body while he laughs.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[checking the peanut plant's pulse], This peanut plant's pulse is staying steady in zero G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, I've never been so light before. ,[spins around uncontrollably, flies directly into some wires and gets zapped by them; she sighs and chuckles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Uhh, I gotta fix that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, ,[playing with her action figures], Teenage Action Girl, rise to the rescue of Action Dog while Teenage Action Boy floats in the corner and mopes. ,[imitating], I don't care. Oh, no! Help me! ,[Pearl floats past Squidina, almost knocking her over], Hey! Watch it, you big orca!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, You watch it, you big dorka!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidina blows a raspberry. Meanwhile in Sandy's treedome, the record playing begins playing country music. The tree's acorns. the running wheel, the Fixin' to Go Nuts record, and the picnic table are floating everywhere. Squidward is cowering in fear, completely unaware of the fact that he is in outer space.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, There can only be one explanation. I've lost my mind! ,[starting to lose sanity], All those years working at the Krusty Krab and I finally snapped! ,[hits his head against the glass and floats down], Ohh, going crazy is actually a relief. ,[sighs], All my stress is gone. ,[spins an acorn on his tentacle; suddenly, the rocket is getting hit by asteroids and space junk outside; Squidward screams in panic], All my stress is back!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Uh-oh, we've got space junk! ,[hops into her chair and begins pushing buttons on her control panel], Everybody, back in your seats. Trays in upright positions. Head between your knees. Your mama can't save you now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob, Squidina, and Pearl sit back into their seats and fasten their seatbelts. The rocket continues flying through the asteroid belt despite getting hit by space junk. A bowling ball crashes into the window and Sandy hits it back outside with a bat.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[cheers with Squidina and Pearl], Home run! ,[whistles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy closes the damaged window with a pair of trousers. The rocket safely makes it out of the asteroid belt.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, We've still get a few Astro Belts to get through. Brace yourselves for the cold belt!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The rocket flies directly into the cold belt, which is a ring of snowmen, igloos, freezers, and icebergs. Squidward floats around while frozen in a block of ice. SpongeBob is building a snowman version of Patrick Star and laughs. Pearl and Squidina hover themselves and shiver. Sandy is wearing a warm coat and holding a mug of hot chocolate. She looks out through the telescope.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Next up, we got a hot belt!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The rocket flies directly into the hot belt, which is a ring of flaming asteroids and stoves. SpongeBob's Patrick-snowman melts from the hot belt's heat.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Patty melt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy breathes heavily and fans herself with her tail; she goes to look through the telescope, but burns her hands],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Ow! ,[blows her hands, looks through the telescope and sees the radiation belt up ahead], Huh! We're going through the radiation belt! That could cause mutations! Everyone, get under your lead blankets!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, ,[gasps], Mutations?! I must protect my beautiful face! ,[puts a lead blanket over her],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob pulls a lead blanket out from his bag and puts it over him. The rocket flies directly through the radiation belt. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob take cover under their lead blankets. SpongeBob sticks his hand out from under the blanket and his hand becomes mutated. SpongeBob laughs and his hand roars. His hand begins gnawing on his helmet.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Aww. ,[chuckles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Back in the treedome, Squidward begins to suffer from the effects of the radiation belt. The belt's effects mutates Squidward's body into different shapes.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, good Neptune! I'm going through puberty again! ,[his body keeps changing shapes and he shrinks into a baby version of himself],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The rocket makes it safely through the radiation belt and resumes flying to the moon.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Okay, Scouts, it's all safe now. ,[Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob uncover themselves; pulls down her telescope], Let's see where we are. ,[looks through], Craters, craters—,[a giant eyeball appears], Oh! Giant eyeball? Now I'm as confused as a goat on Astroturf. ,[hears SpongeBob laughing outside], SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[appears outside and looking through the telescope], Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here. ,[Sandy is angrily wagging her tail], How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, I love the guy, but if his brains were dynamite, he couldn't blow his nose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The rocket lands and makes a successful touchdown on the moon's surface. The rocket deploys its anchor so it won't float away. Back in the treedome, Squidward pops out from under the picnic table.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Huh? We've stopped. It's all over! I'm back home! ,[laughs as he runs to the front door; he exits the dome and begins walking, but he floats downward since there's no gravity; he then notices the planet Earth in front of him], Wait a minute. That's the Earth. And that down there is the moon? So, somehow the treedome flew here. ,[looks down], Good Neptune, I'm falling! Wait, if I remember my high school science, on the moon, I'm much lighter than on Earth. Which means...ha! This fall won't hurt me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[But unfortunately for Squidward, as he lands on the moon and despite the zero gravity, he ends up getting crushed and smooshed into his helmet. He starts waddling around on the Moon's surface until he trips and falls into one of the moon's craters. He gets up and pulls himself together from the fall's impact.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[blubbers as he shakes his head], Oh, shrimp. Now where am I? Maybe this is the way out. ,[peaks through the tube and ends up in the desert; a vulture looks down and screeches at him; and pulls his head back from the tube; he runs over to another one], Maybe this one? ,[peaks through the second tube and ends up in the guitar of the cowboy squirrel],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Country squirrel:, Are y'all ready to go nuts for some hokey hoo-ha?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The crowd cheers. Squidward screams and pulls himself back from the tube.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[walks over to another tube], Third time's a charm? ,[peaks through the tube and ends up in a storyboard artist's drawing, he and the storyboard artist scream at each other; he pulls himself back from the tube and runs off],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Back on the moon's surface, Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina exit the rocket and make their first steps on the moon.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, One small step for a squirrel...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Ooh! ,[goes to exit the rocket, but trips; he falls on top of Pearl and Squidina and they crash into Sandy's pile of camp supplies], One giant leap for SpongeKind. ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy activates her camp supplies and all of the tents get set up for camp.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, All right, Science Scouts, everyone's got an assignment. Pearl, you measure the moon's gravity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, Rah, rah, sis, moon, bahhh! ,[floats upward],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Squidina, you collect moon rocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, Way ahead of you, Ms. Scout Ma'am Cheeks! ,[throws a moon rock and starts looking for more],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, ,[emerges from underneath a large moon boulder], Grrr-avity!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidina sighs and continues her search on more moon rocks.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, SpongeBob, you can search for intelligent life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, You do know how to recognize intelligent life, right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, sure. ,[holds up a saw], I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[sighs, takes the saw, and gives SpongeBob a horn], If you find anything, just toot. ,[SpongeBob takes the horn and floats away with it], Now to study the moon's gravitational effects on my nuts. ,[walks over to her gravitational experiments and begins her tests],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidina continues gathering moon rocks until Pearl rubs her pom-poms on her face.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, I'm number one! You're number two! I'm gonna beat the nerd out of you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, ,[huffs], No one beats the nerd out of Squidina! ,[throws a moon rock at Pearl],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, Whoa! ,[ducks from the incoming moon rock], Missed me! ,[laughs and blows a raspberry],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidina's moon rock float around the moon and hits Pearl in the face.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, Science! Yay!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Meanwhile, Squidward runs out from the moon's crater and boards it shut. He pants from exhaustion, throws his hammer away, and looks at the Earth again.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, maybe being on the moon isn't so bad. After all, ,[takes out a tape measure and extends it], SpongeBob is over 238,000 miles away. ,[pauses and lets go of the tape measure],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Random citizen:, ,[gets hit by the tape measure], Ow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[gasps], This moon is a no SpongeBob zone! ,"[places a flag with a """"No SpongeBob"""" sign on the moon's surface]", Here, I'm the man on the moon! ,[his outburst creates a really loud echo; it was so loud that SpongeBob even heard it],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[pulls out a plastic ear and sticks it on his helmet], Um, did someone say," """"Man on the Moon?"""" ",[looks in the crater], Hello? ,[stands on a stalagmite], Intelligent life? ,[peaks out from the crater], How about average smarts? ,[his bottom sticks out from another crater], I'd settle for common sense! ,[sighs until he sees Squidward's footprints on the moon's surface], Ooh! Intelligent footprints. ,[follows the footprints and climbs over the cliff, where he sees the Krabby Patty delivery Squidward was supposed to deliver; he walks over to the bag and honks the horn], Huh? ,[honks the horn once more], Wha-hoo! ,[marches around while honking the horn], I found it! I found it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[pants as she arrived], What'd you find, SpaceBob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Intelligent life. ,[honks the horn and points to the bag],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[digs into the bag], I'm not so sure about that. ,[pulls out a Krabby Patty], If they were intelligent, they would have eaten this Krabby Patty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating ,[his stomach rumbles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, You're right! It's lunch time. ,[puts the Krabby Patty back in the bag], Would you mind fetching the lunch I prepared?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You bet! Just call me LunchBob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob begins running in place while floating. Sandy pushes SpongeBob down to help him walk on the moon's surface.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:," Just press the button labeled """"lunch!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Meanwhile, Squidward is skipping around on the moon's surface like an stupid idiot. He believes that SpongeBob doesn't exist on the moon and is completely unaware that he's already on it.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no Sp—,[stops at the dark side of the moon], Whoa! The dark side of the moon. ,[whimpers and peaks into it], SpongeBob? Are you in here? ,[pulls his head back out], No SpongeBob. ,[blubbers as he shakes his head], I have a strange feeling suddenly coming over me. Could it be...that I'm...happy? ,[stupidly walks into the dark side of the moon],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is inside Sandy's rocket trying to figure out which button is the lunch button.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is. ,[accidentally pushes the launch button and activates the rocket's engines],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Computer:, Preparing to launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No! ,[frantically pushes the launch button to stop], No, not launch! Lunch! ,[grabs a screwdriver and tries to pry the button off],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The rocket reactivates itself and starts to fly away. The anchor hooks itself on the moon's crater and begins pulling the moon into a different direction.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, Uh, wait, wait—what's going on? ,[falls over],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, ,[whimpers], How should I know? ,[falls over],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, You guys wait here! ,[climbs up the anchor's chain, enters the rocket and stops the engine], Phew! SpongeBob? ,[sees SpongeBob outside the rocket], SpongeBob!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, Sandy! ,[chuckles], Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses. ,[sighs and pants while running in space],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy activates a lasso, grabs SpongeBob and drags him back into the rocket.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, It's okay, SpongeBob. It's my fault for putting the launch and lunch button so close together. ,[looks at the monitor], Oh, no! The moon's been pulled out of its regular orbit. That could have disastrous effects on the Earth's tides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Back on Earth and without the moon in its regular orbit, the ocean's tides are lowered. Bikini Atoll has no water and the ocean level in Bikini Bottom is decreasing.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nat Peterson:, Water's a little dry today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The Bikini Bottomites are doing all that they can to stay alive as long as they can from decreased ocean level.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, And that last launch depleted our fuel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[off-screen], Ho-ho-ho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, That's weird.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Back on the moon, Pearl and Squidina hover together.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, ,[pants], I'm so sorry you're a cheerleader!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, I'm sorry you're a nerd!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl & Squidina:, That came out wrong! ,[cries],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob and Sandy arrive back to Pearl and Squidina.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me. ,[hugs Pearl and Squidina], Come on, Sandy, bring it on in. ,[pulls Sandy in],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, It's all right, Scouts. We just gotta figure out a way to get back to Earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, But Sandy, we heard strange laughing coming from...,[points to the dark side of the moon], in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[off-screen], Ho-ho-ho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward appears from the dark side of the moon while being held by a mysterious being.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl, Squidina, Sandy, & SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[gasps],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Squidward? You're the man on the moon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, SpongeBob?! ,[sighs in defeat], Of course. Why not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The mysterious being comes out from the dark side of the moon. The being turns out to be none other than the jolly old elf himself: Santa Claus. Santa drops Squidward down.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Ohh! ,[falls on the moon's surface and gets crushed and smooshed in his helmet again], Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[notices SpongeBob], SpongeBob? Ho-ho! I should've known you'd have something to do with this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, I know, trouble follows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I was gonna say laughter follows. ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Mr. Claus, what are you doing on the dark side?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, The dark side of the moon is the only place dark enough for me to get any sleep. ,[holds up a book and shows a picture of himself sleeping in his sleigh], I was sleeping like a baby—visions of sugar plums. ,[turns the page and shows picture of Squidward stumbling in Santa's sleigh], Then this bad boy goes and bangs into my sleigh and wakes me up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, I guess I'm getting nothing for Christmas...again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[notices the Earth is far away], Holy night, SpongeBob! Did you shrink the Earth?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[stammers nervously], Good question, Mr. Claus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, We're actually further from the Earth now. We could have moved the moon back into its regular orbit if we hadn't run out of fuel. ,[looks angrily at SpongeBob as he whistles nervously],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, A controlled explosion might move the moon back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, ,[blows her bubble gum and pops], Ha, you're so smart. How do we do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob strains himself as he thinks. He comes up with a really good idea and forms into a lightbulb. He takes out his pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina grab a can of Fizz Bomb Cola. SpongeBob opens his can.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Yee-haw! That's my Science Scouts!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob, Pearl, Squidina, and Sandy open a hole in their helmets and start drinking their soda. The soda's chemicals build up in their stomachs. They all take off their helmets and make the loudest belch in order to move the moon back into place. But nothing happens, since the moon is too heavy to move from such force.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, No go, the moon's too heavy. ,[belches and cover her mouth],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[laughs], I think some children might be needing some brains for Christmas. ,[chuckles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob came up with a different idea. They form a sail using their clothes in hopes of blowing the moon back into its orbit, leaving themselves in their underpants. They hoist the sail up with the mast.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, Perfection!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Now we just wait for a gust of wind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[They wait for a gust of wind. But since there is no air in space, nothing happens.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Uh, interesting science fact: there's no atmosphere on the moon, therefore there's no wind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Santa laughs really hard which causes his belt buckle to fall off.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[dodges Santa's belt buckle], Why don't we just push the moon back?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and Santa look strangely at SpongeBob. SpongeBob warms up and attempts to push the moon back with all his might. Squidina and Pearl attempt to do the same, but the moon is too heavy for them to move.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[laughs], You all should be a sea monster because you're Kraken me up! Get it? Kraken? ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, ,[hops on his sleigh and grabs his beard], Santa Claus, you can do more than just say," """"Ho-ho-ho!"""" at us! You can dig into that toy sack of yours and find something to help!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, But I'm having such a jolly, holly time! ,[Sandy grumbles angrily at Santa], You're right. I'm being naughty, not nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The scene changes back to Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Squidward, Squidina, and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. Santa peaks in the rocket through the window.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, Everyone nestled all snug?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, We're all snug, Santa. But why is SpongeBob with you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[sitting in Santa's sleigh], Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, I want you close to me so I can keep an eye on you. You're a menace! ,[flies his sleigh above Sandy's rocket; SpongeBob falls on Santa's face, but Santa pulls him off], First, I'll push Sandy's rocket ship out of harm's way. SpongeBob, hand me that jack-in-the-box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[digs in Santa's sack and pulls out a jack-in-the-box], Jack-in-the-box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Santa winds up the jack-in-the-box and launches it at Sandy's rocket. The toy pushes the rocket off the moon's surface.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, oh! Let me try! ,[begins winding the jack-in-the-box],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, Be careful! Don't overwind it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But it's gotta be strong enough to move the moon. ,[carelessly overwinds the jack-in-the-box really tight; the jack-in-the-box stops winding and breaks],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, You broke it, and it was my last one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hmm. ,[the handle begins turning slowly], Oh, wait. I think I can hear the last note struggling to get out. Come on, Jack, you can do it. I believe in you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The jack-in-the-box launches out from the box in a fast pace.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, Ho-ho-ho-ho!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The jack-in-the-box hits the moon. But instead of moving it back as it was supposed to, it ends up destroying the moon completely. Various moon rocks float in all directions. SpongeBob and Santa stare in shock.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, What happened? ,[Santa grumbles angrily at SpongeBob], Oh. Okay, sorry. It was my bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Moon rocks and debris fly around Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and Squidward look in shock now that the moon is destroyed. Back on Earth and with the moon gone, the ocean level has decreased even more and there is nothing but standing water. Bikini Bottomites are now crawling on their legs and arms.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frankie Billy:, ,[runs into Martha Smith], Oh, excuse me. Sorry. ,[chuckles],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Frankie Billy gets up and dries up from the heat so Martha can walk by. Back in space, Santa is overwhelmed at what SpongeBob did to the moon.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, Oh-oh-oh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh-oh-oh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, Ho-ho-ho backwards. ,[sulks on his sleigh],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob thinks and comes up with an idea to fix this problem once and for all.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[leans closer to Santa's ear], Santa, do you have any water shooters in your bag?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, Yes, the whole sack is full of 'em.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob digs in Santa's sack and finds a pile of water shooters. SpongeBob grabs a water shooter and gives it to Santa.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, All right, Santa, squirt me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[takes the water shooter], Oh, I get it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob takes off his helmet and Santa sprays SpongeBob with water to make him bigger.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Whoo! Keep 'em coming, Santa!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Santa grabs another water shooter and sprays SpongeBob with water to make him even more bigger. Back on Earth, the Bikini Bottomites are flopping around due to the decreased water level. But then, something miraculous happened. The water level rises up and the oceans are back to normal. Sandy's rocket flies back down to Earth and Sandy's treedome flies back into its rightful place on the ground. Sandy, Squidina, and Squidward exit the tree.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Using the leftover Fizz Bomb Cola made an excellent rocket fuel, Science Scout Squidina.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, Yep, the rocket burped us back. ,[laughs],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pearl:, ,[pulls herself out of Sandy's tree], Wow! Would you mind teaching me some nerdy science stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidina:, Sure, if you'll teach me some airhead cheerleader stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Pearl and Squidina, who have now put aside their differences, skip happily out of Sandy's treedome, nearly knocking over Sandy and Squidward.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Why don't you join the Science Scouts, Squidward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No, thanks! Science is crazy and filled with lunatics! ,[leaves in disgust],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sandy:, Speaking of luna, I wonder how old SpongeBob is doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The scene changes to New York City at night. SpongeBob, now as a temporary moon until Santa creates a brand new one, rises in the night sky and look down at the city.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Good night, Earth! Hey, I'm mooning you. ,[laughs], Hello, lady. You sure look lovely by moonlight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lady:, Aww!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hey, mister! I can see your bald spot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Man #1:, Hey!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Don't be alarmed, people. I'm only here 'til December, when Santa brings everybody a new moon for Christmas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The citizens on the ground are honking their horns and groan as they start complaining.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Man #2:, Come on!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, sorry. Just gave away the big surprise, didn't I? Oh, well. Merry early Christmas!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Santa:, ,[flies past SpongeBob with his sleigh], Ho-ho-ho! You're a menace!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob giggles and winks at the audience, ending the episode.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Krabby Patty?/transcript""","[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick having a fun time in Jellyfish Fields. They attempt to catch some jellyfish but snagged themselves with the nets while there are jellyfish on their heads. Patrick removes his net and the jellyfish stings him, swelling his head. The same thing happens to SpongeBob. They both laugh at each other because of how funny they look. The scene changes to them skipping down the road. Then the scene changes to them brushing their teeth near a mirror at a mirror store, which puzzles several bystanders. Then the scene changes to them at the outlet store. They both slip into a large pair of pants. Then they wobble out of the store.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, oh.
,Patrick:, No, no, just—
,SpongeBob:, Whoa. ,[grunts],
,[The scene changes to the Barg'N-Mart where SpongeBob and Patrick are wobbling in the freezer aisle. As they wobble, they knock over a few things until they lose their balance and fall over.],
,Patrick:, It's harder to walk, but worth it.
,[They stand back up.],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream.
,[SpongeBob's opens the freezer door.],
,Patrick:, So many flavors.
,[A huge stack of ice cream is shown with various flavors. At the top, a mountain climber appears and yodels. SpongeBob and Patrick jump into the freezer.],
,Both:, Whoo-hoo!
,SpongeBob:, Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?
,Patrick:, No, that's too fancy.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick search through the pile until they find one carton of ice cream with the flavor rocky road.],
,Both:, Rocky road!
,Patrick:, With real rocks!
,SpongeBob:, Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps.
,[Moments later, Mr. Krabs comes by with a shopping cart and unintentionally shuts the freezer door on SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Bump. ,[notices SpongeBob and Patrick trapped in the freezer], When did food get so ugly?
,[Mr. Krabs opens the freezer door and takes out one of the frozen dinner boxes while SpongeBob and Patrick are stuck to the door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[reading], ""Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier."" Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient.
,[Mr. Krabs takes out a few frozen dinner boxes and puts them in his cart. SpongeBob and Patrick slide off the door. SpongeBob slides over to the shopping cart, takes one of the boxes, and looks at it.],
,SpongeBob:, Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them.
,[Mr. Krabs' nose ignites like a dynamite and his eyes pops into confetti, which resulted in giving him an idea.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab being recorded for a commercial. Mr. Krabs is at the front doors where he is in between two tables. One table had a plate of Krabby Patties and the other had a box labeled ""Frozen Krabby Patties."" During the commercial, SpongeBob peeks through the window.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can. ,[takes a patty], Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want. ,[stuffs patty in the box], They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?
,Pearl:, Yes, Daddy, and stop babying me!
,[Pearl turns off the camera. The video is shown to a local business executive named Don Grouper. The TV turns off and the picture of Don closes.],
,Mr. Krabs:, So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?
,Don Grouper:, Call me Don.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?
,[Don thinks for a few seconds. As some sort of Easter egg, his thinking face is the same as his picture.],
,Don Grouper:, Mr. Krabs, if you wanna sell zero Krabby Patties and wind up in the poor house, then I say go with your commercial.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh.
,Don Grouper:, But if you really want to be rich, keep your mouth shut, and listen to us, sir. ,[tooth sparkle],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh. Okay.
,[Don pushes the button on the remote, opens the floor and reveals four more executives.],
,Don Grouper:, Let me introduce you to the team here at GGK. That's Barry Goby, Rob Koi, and Limia with her team from creative. Everyone, this is Mr. Krabs and a yellow box.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-
,Don Grouper:, Let's say we give a look-see at what we've cooked up for you.
,[Don pushes the button on the remote, which shuts the blinds on the windows and turns on a hologram of a Krabby Patty.],
,Don Grouper:, The Krabby Patty, a mainstay of dining in Bikini Bottom for a very long time, ,[SpongeBob tries to touch the hologram, but Mr. Krabs stops him.], like an old friend, but not too old, because research shows us old is gross.
,Limia:, Yes, oh, it's absolutely...
,Barry Goby:, Oh, of course...
,Rob Koi:, Just gross.
,Barry Goby:, Yeah, no, it's disgusting.
,Old executive:, Well, I don't think old is gross.
,[Don pushes the button on the remote and opens a trapdoor for the old executive to fall through. The old executive is replaced by a baby executive. The baby spits out its pacifier, takes out her phone and texts it.],
,Baby executive:, Goo-goo, social networking, ah, ah!
,Don Grouper:, Exactly. Now, here are some of the slogans we've been kicking around.
,[Don pushes the button on the remote and shows Martin walking with a Krabby Patty.],
,Don Grouper:, ""Krabby Patties: Like a friend, but edible."" ,[shows another one with a delivery man], ""Krabby Patties: The shut-in's favorite patty."" ,[shows another with two Krabby Patties on a cliff], And finally, ""Krabby Patties: Shove 'em in your mouth-hole!"" ,[mouth-hole burps],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!
,[The executives stare at SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, ""Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice.""
,[Don is silent. The other executives nod their heads in disagreement. The baby executive blows a raspberry.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.
,Don Grouper:, The thing is, Frozen Krabby Patties are a convenience for everyone, and we need a campaign that says exactly that. We need a regular guy to represent all consumers.
,SpongeBob:, Me!
,Don Grouper:, Someone everyone can relate to...
,SpongeBob:, Oh, me, me!
,Don Grouper:, With a face that says, ""I love Krabby Patties.""
,[As Don thinks, SpongeBob winks his eyes. One eye has the letter I on it. The other has a heart on it. SpongeBob then reveals a Krabby Patty on his tongue.],
,Don Grouper:, We find that face, and we have our campaign.
,Mr. Krabs:, And I've got the perfect guy for the job.
,[SpongeBob happily grins. Then a frozen Krabby Patty box is shown being put in the microwave by Patrick. Patrick is sitting on a recliner chair, opens the microwave, takes out the Krabby Patty from the box, and eats it.],
,Patrick:, Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.
,[The filmmaker claps the clapperboard and the scene is finished. Patrick gets of the chair.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that was my slogan.
,[Don walks over to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs with Patrick.],
,Don Grouper:, Great stuff, huh? This guy is gonna be a star!
,Patrick:, I'm already a star.
,Don Grouper:, That's the attitude.
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps],
,Limia:, Sorry, yellow box, Patrick has to make a personal appearance at the mall.
,SpongeBob:, I—oh...
,[SpongeBob sadly walks away.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don, will this commercial really help me make money?
,Don Grouper:, You need to call your bank, Krabs, because they are gonna have to build an extra vault to hold all the extra money.
,[Mr. Krabs faints into Don's arms.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in Southern accent], Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.
,Don Grouper:, I told you, call me Don. ,[tooth sparkle],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don.
,Don Grouper:, Of course, you could double, maybe even triple or quadruple that money, if you... No, forget it.
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?
,Don Grouper:, Well, we ran some numbers and realized that you could make a lot more money if you... changed the formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, How much ""a lot more""?
,Don Grouper:, A lot ""a lot more.""
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, then let's fill her up with filler!
,[SpongeBob walks back in, having heard what Don just said.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[shocked], Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh, no, I-I can— well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.
,SpongeBob:, But what is ""filler""?
,Don Grouper:, ,[walks over to SpongeBob and squishes his head to avoid more questions.], Whoa, hey, this little yellow box sure is full of questions. What do you say we go see where the money's made?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ho-ho, that sounds great!
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab with a large factory built behind it. Don is driving a cart while SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs ride in it.],
,Don Grouper:, Take a look around. It's your dream come true. Through the wonders of automation, this factory can make as many Krabby Patties in one minute as you used to make in a week. Take a whiff of the future, Krabs. Does it smell like money?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffs], Oh, yeah.
,[During the tour, one of the workers ended up on the conveyor belt and is burned and frozen in the process.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, why does that barrel say ""sand""?
,[SpongeBob point to a filler where workers are suspiciously filling it with sand.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it's imported. It's spelled ""sand"" but it's pronounced, ""filler.""
,Don Grouper:, Hey, let's check in on our taste test area.
,[Don drives to cart towards the test lab in a fast motion. He stops and SpongeBob flies into the window of the lab. SpongeBob slides off the window. Mr. Krabs and Don looks into the window where a taste test of the frozen Krabby Patty is being performed.],
,Fish Guy:, Hmm. This tastes kind of bad.
,Limia:, ,[holds up a dinner box with Patrick on it.], Would you buy it, though?
,Fish Guy:, Well, yeah, for the convenience... and the face of that stupid guy ,[chuckles], Though I have noticed a bit of a side effect. Hmm-hmm.
,[The fish guy points to his behind as it appears to have gotten bigger. Limia calls for security and the guards carry the fish guy out,],
,Limia:, ,[laugh], He loves it.
,[Two executives drive up, one of which resembles the vacation salesman from ,That's No Lady,.],
,Executive:, Great news, Krabs. Sales are going all the way up to the surface of the ocean. Here's your first check.
,[The executive gives Mr. Krabs a check. His check revealed to be 100 million dollars.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh?
,[Mr. Krabs opens the check further and reveals more zeroes at the end, meaning he has made a lot of money. He gasps and looks at the back and sees even more zeroes. His pupils scream. Mr. Krabs faints in Don's arms again.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm rich, boy-o, rich!
,SpongeBob:, Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, yes, we can.
,SpongeBob:, Hooray, finally!
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab with a Patrick robot on the roof. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter the restaurant as workers are building inside. SpongeBob runs into the kitchen, takes out his spatula and prepares to make Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whatcha doing, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Making Krabby Patties.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.
,[Nat comes in and brings a robotic SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, You mean my last one for the morning rush?
,Mr. Krabs:, No, ever.
,[Nat moves SpongeBob away from his position with a forklift.],
,SpongeBob:, You mean my last one for today-ever?
,Mr. Krabs:, No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.
,SpongeBob:, ,[confused], Fired?
,[Nat takes the spatula.],
,Mr. Krabs:, But I'm ready to re-hire you.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything.
,Mr. Krabs:, Then follow me.
,[Mr. Krabs leads SpongeBob out of the kitchen. The robotic SpongeBob looks at SpongeBob with red eyes as he leaves. He shows animatronic robots of Patrick, Squidward, and various customers in the restaurant. The Krusty Krab has somehow turned into a museum under Don Grouper's orders.],
,Robot Patrick:, This tastes nice.
,[A robotic Plankton is at the safe and is hammered by a robot Mr. Krabs.],
,Robot Plankton:, Ow, curses, foiled again, ow.
,SpongeBob:, You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all. ,[carries SpongeBob to the gift shop.], You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.
,[Mr. Krabs takes out a frozen Krabby Patty, puts it in the microwave, and heats it up.],
,Patrick Microwave:, Ding.
,[Mr. Krabs takes out the heated up Krabby Patty.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.
,[Mr. Krabs eats the Krabby Patty. However, he does not appear to be enjoying it because of the taste.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, it's so convenient, see? ,[chuckles],
,[Squidward walks in.],
,Squidward:, And what about me?
,[Mr. Krabs swallows the patty and puts it in his pocket.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.
,Squidward:, Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh! No, you're just fired.
,Squidward:, What? No, you don't fire me—I quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared. ,[reads resignation letter], ""Dear Mr. Krabs—""
,Mr. Krabs:, Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.
,Squidward:, What the—what?! ,[continues reading as he is being carried out by a delivery man], ""I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am free—free to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!""
,[Mr. Krabs places a Krabby Patty shaped hat on SpongeBob's head and opens the front door to let customers in.],
,SpongeBob:, Ahem, ,[reads card], ""hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket.""
,[The robotic Squidward behind SpongeBob explodes.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop.
,Mr. Krabs:, Atta boy, embrace the future!
,[Mr. Krabs leaves. The robotic Squidward's head lands on the floor. As time passes by, customers with larger butts continue to by Frozen Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs goes to the bank and gives the bank loaner a check. The loaner gives Mr. Krabs a huge sack of money, which resulted in Mr. Krabs fainting. The loaner pushes the bag off of the counter. Patrick is at the Barg'N-Mart signing autographs to his fans. SpongeBob attempts to get Patrick's attention. But due to the popularity, he is being ignored as Patrick is busy signing autographs to his fans. Mr. Krabs is in his swimsuit and goes into a pool of money. He swims all around the pool. Then he pulls down a lever and money pours down on him. The scene then changes to a local hotel where it is built at the spot where Patrick's house used to be. SpongeBob goes into the hotel.],
,Elevator operator:, Going up?
,[SpongeBob goes into the elevator.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.
,Elevator operator:, Uh-huh.
,SpongeBob:, I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants. ,[laughs], Again.
,Elevator operator:, ,[grossed out], You should get out. Now.
,[SpongeBob leaves the elevator and goes into a room filled with rich people at Patrick's party.],
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.
,Colonel Sandab:, Uh, Patrick, did you order something through the mail? 'Cause a yellow box just arrived for you.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.
,Colonel Sandab:, Uh, excuse me, yellow box, are you feeling a little overheated? Because I do—I say, I do believe that you are melting. ,[laughs],
,[The snotty rich people laugh at SpongeBob as the ice cream melts.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?
,Patrick:, Oh, I don't know.
,Limia:, It's just past the solid gold gym. Take a right at the zoo.
,SpongeBob:, I'll come with you, SpongeBob.
,Limia:, He can find the kitchen by himself. The press needs some photos of you with your new mascot friends.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Aww.
,Patrick:, ,[sadly], Aww.
,[SpongeBob sulks to the kitchen freezer and opens it. In it is a huge stack of HOGAN DUEP ice cream. A yodel is heard in the background. SpongeBob looks sadly at the freezer. He didn't bother to put the ice cream he brought to the party in the freezer, so he places it on the countertop. He sulks away as Patrick is getting photos from the press.],
,Press:, This way, Mr. Star! Hey, Patrick, over here! Over here, right here! Who are you wearing?
,French Narrator:, The next day...
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking at the front door of the Krusty Krab Museum. He sighs and puts on the Krabby Patty hat. He walks into the former restaurant and trips over Squidward's foot.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, oof!
,Squidward:, Ow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[his body is face-down but his face come out and sees Squidward], Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.
,Squidward:, I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams. ,[holds out paper that reveals that Squidward has been a cashier for exactly 17 years.], I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.
,SpongeBob:, I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.
,Robot Squidward:, I love my job. Thanks for coming!
,Squidward:, Totally out of character.
,[Squidward takes the Krusty Krab hat, pushes the robotic Squidward out of the register boat, and takes over.],
,Squidward:, ,[mechanical-esque], I hate everyone. ,[regular], Huh, much better.
,French Narrator:, Later...
,[The scene changes to the filmmakers at the Krusty Krab Museum setting up for a commercial.],
,Patrick:, ,[reads script], ""Tastes so nice that they—""
,Squidward:, They taste like lice!
,Patrick:, Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.
,Squidward:, Huh?
,[Nat grabs Squidward and flips him over. Then he takes out a drill and proceeds to painfully drill Squidward in the behind.],
,Squidward:, What are you doing with this—ow!
,Patrick:, ,[reads script], ""Tastes so nice that they taste nice.""
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?
,Limia:, Excuse me, yellow box, Mr. Star is not to be disturbed. He's very, very busy right now.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, sure. I get it.
,[SpongeBob sulks away.],
,Patrick:, But he's my friend.
,Limia:, You're a star. You have no friends.
,[Limia walks away and Don comes to check on Patrick.],
,Patrick:, ,[sighs], What am I doing again?
,Don Grouper:, Stand over here and say your line. And...action.
,[Don gives Patrick a Krabby Patty before he leaves for the filming to begin. Patrick is standing next to a table of Frozen Krabby Patties with the number 400 sign. Patrick eats the patty but doesn't appeared to be thrilled with it.],
,Patrick:, Tastes so nice, it... uh... ,[Patrick throws down the Krabby Patty and starts looking and acting depressed.], blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...
,[Patrick becomes depressed as the 400 sign lights up. Confetti is then released.],
,Don Grouper:, And..cut! Alright, you guys can fix that in post. Okay? that's a wrap. Let's pack it up.
,[Limia walks up with a contract for Patrick to sign.],
,Limia:, Okay, and here. And here. Okay, and then sign here. And again here.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties.
,[SpongeBob notices a filmmaker eating one of the Frozen Krabby Patty. After he eats it, he goes to remove the headlight and his behind becomes larger.],
,Filmmaker 2:, Looks like you've been hitting the patties pretty hard there.
,Filmmaker 1:, Speak for yourself.
,[The other filmmaker's behind is larger than the other.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out. ,[continues as filmmaker is carrying SpongeBob], I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!
,[The filmmaker places SpongeBob in a box that comically contains yellow boxes.],
,Limia:, Come on, Mr. Star. You've got an 11:00 eyeball waxing.
,Patrick:, ,[sighs], See you later, SpongeBob.
,[Patrick sulks away.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Aww.
,[Patrick and Limia walk up to a limo where they are driven away, while a bicyclist follows them with a sign that says ""Eat Frozen Krabby Patties."" Meanwhile, Plankton sneaks by, hoping that he will finally get the secret formula.],
,Plankton:, Finally, now is my chance to strike.
,[Plankton runs into the museum.],
,SpongeBob:, Welcome to the original Krusty—
,[Plankton runs up to the safe where the robotic Plankton and Mr. Krabs are being operated.],
,Robot Plankton:, Curses, foiled again. Curses, foiled again.
,Plankton:, Pfft, never happened.
,[Plankton jumps into the safe, grabs the formula, and kicks the robotic Plankton.],
,Plankton:, Now to make my escape.
,[Plankton make his escape as he laughs. Surprisingly, robotic Mr. Krabs's hammer does not smash Plankton. However, he stops to notice that SpongeBob is not in the mood for chasing him.],
,Plankton:, Aren't you gonna try and stop me?
,SpongeBob:, That'll be $1.99, please.
,Plankton:, What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.
,SpongeBob:, Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.
,[SpongeBob takes one of the bottles and pulls out a blank paper.],
,SpongeBob:, See? They're all just fakes. ,[rips up the paper], Everything here is a fake!
,Plankton:, Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to? ,[smashes bottle], All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.
,Patrick Microwave:, Ding.
,[SpongeBob takes the patty out of the microwave and gives it to Plankton.],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Yes, you fools!
,[Plankton runs off.],
,Squidward:, Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?
,[SpongeBob takes a bite of the Frozen Krabby Patty and doesn't like the taste of it. Then suddenly, without warning, he throws up sand and it forms into a sandcastle. SpongeBob then coughs up a toy shovel.],
,SpongeBob:, Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either.
,Squidward:, Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?
,SpongeBob:, Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.
,[SpongeBob runs to the kitchen, retrieves his spatula, and kicks away the robot SpongeBob. He opens his body and takes out the real Krabby Patty formula. He opens the bottle, takes out the formula and reads it. His eyes glimmer with happiness.],
,SpongeBob:, Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh, ,[puts Krusty Krab hat on], not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick.
,[SpongeBob cooks the patty on the grill. As he cooks, depressed citizens with large butts smell the scent of the Krabby Patty being handmade by SpongeBob. Meanwhile, Patrick is getting interviews from the press with Don and Limia.],
,Press:, Over here. Right here, Patrick. Right here, right here. One, more, Patrick.
,Agent:, Patrick, baby, sweetheart, have you thought about that feature film I pitched youse?
,[Patrick sadly looks at the picture of himself with SpongeBob until a camera man flashes in Patrick's eyes. Patrick is finally fed up with his popularity.],
,Patrick:, That's it. I can't take it anymore. Everybody out!
,[Don, Limia, and the press leaves Patrick's hotel.],
,Patrick:, I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm... ,[rubs his picture with his hand], I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.
,[Meanwhile, SpongeBob has finished his handmade Krabby Patty.],
,SpongeBob:, Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship.
,[Patrick sulks at the balcony when he sees SpongeBob running up to him.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! ,[Patrick leaves the hotel and runs to SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[through a bullhorn], Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!
,Patrick:, ,[Still running and not hearing,],SpongeBob, what?
,SpongeBob:, ,[through a cell phone], Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!
,Patrick:, ,[through a telephone], I thought they tasted familiar!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick soon crash into each other.],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob?
,[SpongeBob pulls himself off of Patrick and lands with a big hole in his face. He regenerates his face.],
,SpongeBob:, Missed you.
,Patrick:, I missed you too.
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out the Krabby Patty he made himself], I got something for you, from one friend to another.
,Patrick:, No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!
,[SpongeBob stuffs his handmade Krabby Patty into Patrick's mouth. As he eats it, he begins to feel a sense of happiness. He flies around the air with joy.],
,Patrick:, Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.
,SpongeBob:, Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty.
,Patrick:, But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand? ,[kicks sand in SpongeBob's face],
,[SpongeBob wipes the sand off his face.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach.
,[The scene changes to the shareholder meeting. Don and Mr. Krabs are on stage speaking to the audience.],
,Don Grouper:, Thank you, everyone, for coming to this gala event celebrating the meteoric success of Frozen Krabby Patties. In honor of this momentous occasion, we are going to premiere our 400th commercial.
,Mr. Krabs:, And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!
,[The audience cheers and Patrick walks up to the speaker.],
,Patrick:, Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...
,[Patrick looks at SpongeBob, who gives him a thumbs up. Then he turns to the audience.],
,Patrick:, That...,[looks at Don and Mr. Krabs], that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
,Patrick:, ...Made with sand!
,[The audience gasps in shock.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shocked], Oh, no!
,[Mr. Krabs faints in Don's arms again.],
,Don Grouper:, That was cute when you were rich. ,[drops Mr. Krabs], I'm out of here.
,[Don leaves the stage as the audience vomit out sand. In doing so, their butts shrink down to their normal size. The scene changes to a graph of the Frozen Krabby Patty sales going down.],
,Perch Perkins:, And in shocking news today, it has been revealed that Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand.
,[As everyone is watching the news, various people vomit out sand and their butts shrink back to normal. One of which vomits out palm trees. Another vomits out patty-shaped sand. Another vomits out sand shaped like a rectangular box. Another vomits sand through his eye sockets. Another vomits out sand with a snail in it. Then their butts begins to shrivel up afterwards. Not wanting to take this anymore, the customers decided once and for all to throw away all of the frozen patties they bought. Mr. Krabs is seen near a trashcan, depressed. The Krusty Factory is being closed down and pushed away by construction workers.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined. ,[sobs], What?
,[Mr. Krabs peeks into the Krusty Krab and sees customers eating the handmade Krabby Patties and are enjoying them.],
,Harold:, Now that's the taste I remember.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's strange.
,[Mr. Krabs walks into the restaurant and sees all of the automatic robots being thrown out.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?
,Squidward:, Uh, ,[mechanical-like], I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[regular], It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are in the kitchen making Krabby Patties, sharing the same pants they wore in the beginning. Mr. Krabs walks in.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, did you do all this?
,SpongeBob:, Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped.
,Patrick:, A friend always helps. It's called ""frelping,"" and I was very frelpful.
,Mr. Krabs:, But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.
,SpongeBob:, The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Fresh?
,SpongeBob:, Go on, have a bite.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no I—
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, just a nibble.
,[SpongeBob spreads the patty on Mr. Krabs' face. Mr. Krabs takes a taste of the juice.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Here!
,[Mr. Krabs nibbles on the fresh patty.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor. ,[rubs his face], The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?
,SpongeBob:, Nothing, we're not selling them.
,Patrick:, Yeah, we just give them away.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[freaks out], Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think. ,[jumps into the pants], How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!
,Mr. Krabs:, Great, now get back to work! ,[laughs],
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[Mr. Krabs is laughing in his office as he is reading a book. SpongeBob and Squidward show up],
,SpongeBob:, Exciting reading, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh. You bet you, SpongeBob. Listen to this. Individual waste of the enus will substantially broaden the probability of multiple substantial visits, generating an inverse negative revenue margin of three quarters and one half of one percent: meaning if you call the customers by their names, they keep coming to spend more of their green back! So I want you two to learn the names of every customer.
,Squidward:, I have an important life to live, and it doesn't include chattering with you two ninnies.
,Mr. Krabs:, I thought you might say that, so I decided to turn this into a contest. The employee who learns more names wins this. ,[Squidward takes a brochure and gasps],
,Squidward:, A tropical getaway? On the triple decker Conhugo cruise liner? Sunbathing—Parcheesi—ballroom dancing! This is going to be so easy. SpongeBob doesn't realize that I'm the face of The Krusty Krab. While he's isolated in the kitchen all day, Ill be out here, building a rapport with the customers. ,[walks up to Evelyn eating], Hello. May I get you anything else, Miss--
,Evelyn:, Since when do you give two shrimps about customer service, Mr. Grouchy Squidguy?
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Sally! Hi, Sadie! Hi, Shubie!
,Squidward:, How does SpongeBob know all these names?
,SpongeBob:, Right back at you, Lenny!
,Squidward:, Hey, SpongeBob, could you take a look in the cash register? I think it's broken.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sure, Squidward.
,Squidward:, I think you might need a closer look. Let me give you a hand. ,[shoves SpongeBob in the cash register],
,SpongeBob:, I can't see anything in here, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Keep looking, SpongeBob. keep on looking. ,[walks up to Thaddeus], So, what's your name? ,[SpongeBob squeezes out of a mustard bottle],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Thaddeus!
,Squidward:, Goodbye, SpongeBob. ,[takes the mustard bottle from Thaddeus and puts in on the ground outside. Stomps on it and sends SpongeBob soaring in the background. Then he walks back in The Krusty Krab], That should buy me enough time to win that cruise. ,[Gus walks in],
,Gus:, Good day, young sir! My name is-- ,[SpongeBob pops up from under his hat],
,SpongeBob:, Gus!
,Gus:, He's right! This guy's so good, you should give him a prize.
,Squidward:, ,[grabs SpongeBob], How in Neptune's creation do you know all these names, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I simply compile the name of every customer in this book. ,[holds up a book called ""The Customers of The Krusty Krab and Why I Love Them. By SBSP""],
,Squidward:, ,[grabs the book], Thanks, SpongeBob! ,[jumps from table to table saying all the customers names], Let's see. Halbert, Norma, Isabelle, Gus, Chas, Pelar, Jess, Cara, Ivy, Harv, Mable, Mavis-- ,[crawls up to Suzie who is eating her food], And your name is—Suzie Fish, correct?
,Suzie:, Yes, and you'd also be correct in saying you ruined my food with your sweat, you nitwit! ,[walks away],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs! That's the last customer. Do I win?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, well, actually, I wasn't keeping score. But I'll just say that you and SpongeBob are neck and neck. That mystery guy over there will be the tie breaker. ,[""That mystery guy"" eats his food],
,Squidward:, Uh, that's, that's--
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's-- that's-- I know him. It's-- something.
,Mr. Krabs:, He's the ticket to your prize.
,Squidward:, ,[shoves SpongeBob], Out of the way, loser. ,[runs over to What Zit Tooya], Um, hello. My name is Squidward. ,[What Zit Tooya looks at him with an annoyed face], Uh, so, what's your name?
,What Zit Tooya:, What's it to ya?
,Squidward:, Uh, it's just that I was going to—enter your name in our sweepstakes! ,[takes out paper and pen], So, what should I put down?
,What Zit Tooya:, ,[gulps], First and last name?
,Squidward:, Sure.
,What Zit Tooya:, Yeah, why don't you write this on your form. What Zit-- ,[inhales deeply], --Tooya! Now leave me alone! ,[eats his food as SpongeBob walks over],
,Squidward:, ,[whispers to SpongeBob], I see he wants to play hard to get. So be it! I have ways of making the likes of him talk. ,[runs up to the customer with a cup of soda], Uh, sir, you forgot your soda.
,What Zit Tooya:, I didn't order any soda.
,Squidward:, It's on the house. ,[the customer smiles as Squidward throws the soda in his face],
,What Zit Tooya:, What the barnacles are you doing?!
,Squidward:, Oh, I'm sorry, I slipped. Here, let me get that off of you. ,[takes the customer's jacket off], Okay, there must be a name tag or some form of I.D. in here.
,What Zit Tooya:, ,[takes his jacket from Squidward], I don't need your help. ,[puts the jacket on], I'm out of here! ,[Squidward follows him],
,Squidward:, Hey, look up in the sky! A giant meteor is hurtling towards Earth.
,What Zit Tooya:, Where? ,[Squidward reaches inside his jacket and takes out his wallet],
,Squidward:, Oh, you'll see it, Just keep looking.
,What Zit Tooya:, I can't see it.
,Squidward:, Well, that's too bad, because I found what I was looking for. ,[laughs as he runs off with the wallet],
,What Zit Tooya:, Hey! Come back here! Give me my wallet! ,[traffic sign changes to ""Stop"" as Squidward, who is still laughing runs past a policefish who is eating a doughnut. Mumbling I’d heard on the walkie-talkie],
,Policefish:, ,[drops his doughnut], Holy sea cow! That hooligan ran a stop sign! ,[chases after Squidward],
,What Zit Tooya:, Stop, thief!
,Policefish:, You know that guy?
,What Zit Tooya:, Hardly. He stole my wallet.
,Policefish:, ,What?!, That makes him a dual offender! Let's get him! ,[Squidward runs up a ladder to the top of a building as Policefish blows his whistle. at last, Squidward was on the top of the building],
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], Finally, the moment of truth! Say goodbye to anonymity, Mr.--
,Policefish:, ,[grabs the wallet], Freeze thief!
,Squidward:, No, you don't understand. I only want the wallet for--
,What Zit Tooya:, We know exactly why you want it, wallet snatcher! ,[Squidward tries not letting go of the wallet],
,Squidward:, ,[grunting], This isn't as it seems!
,Policefish:, That's what you'll be saying in the slammer, punk! ,[the wallet rips. Squidward grabs his license],
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], His driver's license! ,[laughs], At last! At last! And your name is-- ,[sees What Zit Tooya's face and everything on it], Mr. What Zit Tooya? What kind of ridiculous name is that?,[looks at What Zit Tooya with an angry face],
,What Zit Tooya:, It's ,my, ridiculous name! ""What Zit Tooya!""
,Policefish:, ,[hits Squidward on the head with his nightstick as he falls down], That's enough of that ballyhoo. ,[handcuffs Squidward],
,Squidward:, But-but-but, I-I-I didn't intentionally do anything wrong.
,Policefish:, Tell it to the judge, lawbreaker. ,[puts Squidward in the police car as the siren blares and takes off. Cut to Bikini Bottom Jail],
,Squidward:, ,[crosses out a day on his calendar], Only 364 more days and 9 years left until I exchange this concrete tomb for a multi-story ocean liner cruise. ,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk up to Squidward's cell],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob?
,Mr. Krabs:, The boy and I just thought we'd stop by and check on our convict friend.
,Squidward:, Call me what you may, fact of the matter is I found out the mystery customer's name first. So I win. ,[laughs], I win, I win, I win, I win, I win, I win!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hands out Squidward the brochure], Enjoy your prize.
,Squidward:, Whoo-hoo-hoo! Tropical vacation, here I come! ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Vacation? Who said anything about a vacation?
,Squidward:, ,[stops dancing], What? In the brochure, it specifically gives away an ocean liner vacation.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, you mean that brochure. Well, that was the prize. The brochure. It was taking up too much room in me drawers, you know. It's your prize.
,Squidward:, You mean, no vacation?
,Mr. Krabs:, Nope, just the brochure. Well, got to get back to counting me loot. Enjoy your new prize, Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, See you on the outside in ten years, buddy. ,[walks away],
,Squidward:, ,[laughs maniacally while tearing up the brochure], Oh, well. At least I'll have some peace and quiet for the next ten years.
,Patrick:, ,[sitting in the same cell with a game of Parcheesi on a stool], Hey, Squidward. Parcheesi? ,[Squidward falls as broken pieces],

"[Everyone is sleeping until SpongeBob's foghorn alarm wakes them up],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, Squidward!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!
,SpongeBob:, I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.
,Squidward:, Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.
,SpongeBob:, My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.
,Squidward:, You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.
,SpongeBob:, What's that, Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,(provoked), IT'S SUNDAY! ,[angrily kicks SpongeBob out of his house], A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!
,SpongeBob:, Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgets his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him. ,[breaks the string that holds the paper together], Man this is heavy. ,[bumps into Patrick], Oh, pardon me.
,Patrick:, Hey, watch where you're going. ,[screams], Newspaper monster!
,SpongeBob:, ,[throws paper in the air, screaming], Monster! ,[both scream and run around],
,Squidward:, Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday. ,[hums], My Sunday relaxation kit. ,[reaches into box], Let's see…pillow. ,[puts pillow on end of couch], Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance. ,[sprays fragrance on flower. The flower dies], Ah, and the final touch. ,[dials on phone], Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man. ,[hangs up phone], This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot. ,[grabs a box], Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder. Take me on a chocolate vacation. ,[SpongeBob & Patrick raise up from behind the couch making noises. Squidward spits out his chocolate],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.
,Squidward:, What are you two idiots doing?
,Patrick:, Secret ritual.
,SpongeBob:, To inaugurate you as president.
,Squidward:, Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.
,Patrick:, No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.
,Squidward:, Better?
,SpongeBob:, You're the president of 'The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge'.
,Squidward:, The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up? ,[SpongeBob & Patrick laugh],
,Patrick:, Maybe. ,[both laugh],
,SpongeBob:, It's a secret. ,[both laugh],
,Squidward:, Fine. As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer? ,[pushing SpongeBob & Patrick out the door], Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays. ,[when he closes the door, SpongeBob & Patrick appear from inside],
,SpongeBob:, What colors should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?
,Squidward:, Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Wow. Polka dots.
,Patrick:, Our new president is a genius.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. ,[both laugh],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, See ya later, Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, ,[now outside, a red paint can drops on the ground], Whenever you're ready, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick unscrews SpongeBob's hat which turns out to be a screw], Hold still, buddy. ,[pours the red paint inside SpongeBob's hole. When he is done, he throws the can away and ends up hitting an elderly citizen riding a bike. Patrick screws the hat back in],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.
,Patrick:, Okie dokie. ,[Patrick shakes SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Okay! I'm ready! ,[Patrick grabs SpongeBob's arm and uses it like a slot machine. Drops of red paint come shooting out SpongeBob's holes and onto trees], Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.
,Squidward:, ,[clock on wall is ringing noon], Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[outside one of Squidward's windows singing], Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-la-la.
,Squidward:, What's going on out there?
,SpongeBob:, Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the- ,[Patrick pulls on SpongeBob's arm which makes the paint shoot out his holes and all over Squidward's face and in his eyes],
,Squidward:, ,[screams], My eyes! ,[runs around bumping into stuff. Runs outside and in front of a car],
,Debbie Rechid:, Look out! ,[car slams on brakes and stops in front of Squidward],
,Ralph:, Oh, you poor man.
,Debbie:, You must be very sick! Let us take you to the hospital.
,Squidward:, No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh… ,[car drives off],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, See ya later, neighbor!
,Patrick:, It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, our president sure knows how to live. ,[later], I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick. ,[Patrick is snoring], OK…Squidward? ,[Squidward's chair is empty], Squidward? Squidward, you home?
,Patrick:, Did you find him, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.
,Patrick:, Or maybe he's on a secret mission.
,SpongeBob:, I hope he's not in danger.
,Patrick:, Danger?!
,SpongeBob:, As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.
,Harold (red fish):, Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?
,SpongeBob:, Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.
,Squidward:, At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to. ,[SpongeBob & Patrick are laughing inside Squidward's house. Squidward opens his front door], What are you two doing in my house?
,SpongeBob:, We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.
,Patrick:, I say he checks out a-ok.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? ,[shows foot with long toenails],
,Squidward:, French tips, huh? ,[pushes SpongeBob's chair to the side], Alright, pal, make with the foot massage, pronto!
,Harold (red fish):, Uh-oh. Sorry. Your hour's up.
,Squidward:, ,[He angrily twitches his eye. As SpongeBob continues wiggling his toes, he furious turns red and makes way toward the front door], Alright, you two! Out! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk out], And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day. Or tomorrow, or next week.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, does that include…
,Squidward:, ,[angrily screams],  'Yes, it does! ,[furiously slams door],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?
,Squidward:, ,[angrily busts head through the door, exploding], Yes, I was! You call yourselves good neighbors?! You're the worst neighbors ever! ,[deep breath], You don't deserve to wear those fezzes! ,[furiously takes SpongeBob and Patrick's fezzes and angrily stomps them into the ground],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right.
,Patrick:, Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.
,Squidward:, ,[furiously explodes once again], No, you aren't! You're horrible neighbors! ,[he angrily hyperventilates], And stop calling me president!
,SpongeBob:, C'mon, let's go. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick sadly walk away],
,Squidward:, There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper. ,[notices pile of paper on ground with a note on it],
,SpongeBob:, ,['Here's Your Sunday Paper Squidward. Enjoy. Love, SpongeBob.'.],
,[Squidward steams up furiously, kicks the paper into the air, then growls like a dog. Then he takes a paper off his head.],
,Squidward:, Good neighbors my right. ,[reads paper], Hello? ""Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation"" ,[Squidward does an evil laugh. Later, he has the security system built in and turned on],
,Security System:, System Activated.
,Squidward:, That oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.
,SpongeBob:, ,[he with Patrick, with their fezzes back on, walk up to Squidward], President Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[screams], What the…?!
,SpongeBob:, We hereby present you with this delicious cake.
,Squidward:, ,[reads writing on cake], ""Sorry for bugging you so much""? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!
,Security System:, No threat detected.
,Squidward:, ,[angry, banging on security system], Grrr! You infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!
,Security System:, Threat detected. ,[The system shoots a laser at Squidward which makes SpongeBob & Patrick's cake fly into the air and land on the system, causing it to go haywire.],
,Squidward:, What's going on?
,Security System:, Threat detected. Code red! Code red!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughing as fireworks are shooting out all over Squidward's house], It's like a carnival ride.
,Squidward:, ,[running around], Run for your lives! ,[Squidward's house suddenly grows legs and arms and stands up. Then grabs Squidward from inside], What the? What are you doing?!,[Squidward's house kicks him into the air and walks off.], I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for. ,[laughs hysterically], I am gonna relax if it kills me.
,[Meanwhile, Squidward's house is on a rampage.],
,Army:, Fire! ,[The tank fires a missile at the house, but the house catches the missile and flicks it away. Then the house grabs the tank and squishes it.],
,Patrick:, Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.
,SpongeBob:, We gotta turn this thing off. ,[turns on a light switch], Nope, not it.
,Patrick:, ,[flushes the toilet], Nope.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns on the fan], Nope.
,Patrick:, ,[pushes the toasted button down], That's not it, either.
,Squidward:, ,[still resting], This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot. ,[house stands right above Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Hmmm, where to look. ,[notices an ""off button"" on the wall], Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious. ,[pushes button and house sits on top of Squidward and goes back to normal], We did it, Patrick! ,[Squidward busts through from beneath the floor], President Squidward?
,Squidward:, No-no, don't say anything anymore. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so that I can get ready for work tomorrow.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. President-
,Squidward:, Shush.
,SpongeBob:, But we just wanted to…
,Squidward:, ,[yells in their faces angrily], Get out of my house! Huh?
,[As soon as SpongeBob and Patrick flee from Squidward, a whole crowd and two police boats appear outside Squidward's house.],
,Scooter:, There he is!
,Green Fish:, Are you the owner of this house?
,Squidward:, Yes! Yes, I am!
,Green Fish:, Then on behalf of the citizens of Bikini Bottom, ,[the angry fish hands him a warrant], I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life.
,Squidward:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too? ,[SpongeBob & Patrick walk up with a summons in their hands], This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward.

"[It is a normal day at the Krusty Krab. Or so everyone thinks. Plankton is disguised as a peppershaker. He steals a Krabby Patty from a customer.],
,Plankton:, Ha! ,[runs out of the Krusty Krab. However, Mr. Krabs picks him up from behind],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold it right there, Plankton.
,Plankton:, Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll take that. ,[Gets the Krabby Patty from him],
,Plankton:, How'd you know it was me?
,Mr. Krabs:, Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.
,Plankton:, Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.
,Mr. Krabs:, You think? SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob runs onto the scene],
,SpongeBob:, Wooo-ooo! ,[Krabs puts Plankton in his mouth],
,Announcer:, ,[off-screen], 3, 2, 1…, launch! ,[SpongeBob launches Plankton out of his hat and through the Chum Bucket roof],
,Plankton:, AAHH!
,[Cut to the park. Plankton is on a bench],
,Plankton:, Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful. If only there were a way to render him helpless!
,Sadie:, ,[with her baby], Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.
,Plankton:, Hey, I resent that! Huh?
,Sadie:, ,[she takes the bottle from her baby], Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could take your formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it. ,[the baby starts crying, Sadie puts the bottle back into her baby's mouth and moves on],
,Plankton:, Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless… baby.

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[A penny catches his eye], Ooh, a penny. ,[He sees a trail of pennies], A trail of pennies! ,[They lead him into a phone booth outside. We see some green gas appear around Krabs.],

This is easier than I hoped. ,[Looks at baby Krabs], He's a little bigger than I imagined. ,[baby Krabs takes the key and swings it up and down, then puts Plankton into his mouth and starts biting him], Whoa! No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Oof! Whoa! ,[baby Krabs then sucks on Plankton, and releases him. He runs for the front doors of the Krusty Krab, with Krabs following behind him, but he can't reach.],

Not even a Krabby Patty helps. ,[reaches into his pocket],How about a stack of 20s? ,[shows a stack of $20 bills; Krabs takes it and chews on it],

Mr. Krabs turns back into an adult, wearing a diaper, and SpongeBob turns into a baby], What? SpongeBob's a baby, but Krabs is back to normal? ,[sprays again. Mr. Krabs returns to his baby form as SpongeBob returns to normal, but is still wearing a rectangular diaper and is barefoot], It seems the second dose acts as an antidote! [sprays only SpongeBob, and he is turned back into a baby again] One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult! ,[sprays both of them once, and they come back to normal. They're still wearing their diapers], Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult? ,[tries to spray them, but nothing comes out], Barnacles, I've run out of gas!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahem!
,Plankton:, Krabs! Nice diaper. ,[Mr. Krabs is about to throw him], Hold on, hold on! I think I... ,[throws him like a slingshot pellet; cut to Plankton flying in the air], Yes, I've got it!

,Mr. Krabs:, Eh? What was that, sonny?
,Plankton:, Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless. ,[SpongeBob comes out of nowhere],
,SpongeBob:, Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!
,Plankton:, I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again! ,[sprays the gas on SpongeBob, turning him into a senior citizen],
,SpongeBob:, I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.
,Plankton:, This baby gas is worthless! ,[throws the spray fan away], At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!
,SpongeBob:, What was that, sonny?
,Plankton:, It'll take more time to explain than you have left. ,[walks away; runs back out with a Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffs],He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!
,SpongeBob:, Catch who?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Gesundheit.

I'm an adult! ,[SpongeBob grabs him and starts sucking on him like a pacifier. Spits him out into Patrick's diaper. Patrick farts and Plankton runs away from him, screaming], Huh?

Give it here, you big stupid baby! ,[baby Krabs smashes Plankton with the bottle], Ow. ,[he squishes him four more times as Baby Thaddeus laughs. As baby Mr. Krabs crawls away, Plankton emerges, groaning in pain], I've got it! Just like taking candy from a baby! Get it, Krabs? I'm taking candy from ,you!, ,[baby SpongeBob starts playing with the gas tank by repeatedly banging it against the ground], Hey! What are you doing? ,[the gas tank rises into the air like a rocket ship and releases gas everywhere, which sprays onto Plankton], Uh-oh. ,[he shrinks until he is no longer seen as he is in another dimension with amoebas floating around him], Ahem! ,[he covers himself], Mama's evil little genius needs a diaper!

,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,[They start swerving on the road with SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick screaming and they eventually drive off a cliff and lands on the ground with the bus tumbling many times. They all get off the bus],
,Mr. Krabs:, Good news, boys! We only sustained a flat tire! Patrick, go get the spare lad!
,Patrick:, Uh...oh! Yeah, I can't.
,Squidward:, What do you mean you can't?
,Patrick:, Well...
,Squidward:, No no! Wait! Let me guess: You ate the spare tire?
,Patrick:, Wow...you're good at guessing...
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, why didn't you just ask me? ,[Takes out a small plastic bag with very small tires in it], You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals! You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually. ,[Eats one of the tires], Hmm...Squidward? They're fat free!
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, I'd like some money for cab fair.
,Mr. Krabs:, But, Mr. Squidward!
,Squidward:, But nothing. I'm going home. Now put some cash in my hands so I...
,Mr. Krabs:, Wah! ,[Hugs Squidward], But I don't have any money, lad! Not even a nickel! It's all gone! Me Krusty Krab is gone!
,Squidward:, ,[Pushes away Mr. Krabs], Forget it! I'll just walk! ,[Starts to walk off],
,SpongeBob:, Wait! Squidward! Squidward! You can't go! Please! Don't you see? The Krusty Krab needs us more than ever!
,Squidward:, I could care less what the Krusty Krab needs! ,[Moves SpongeBob away], Now get out of my way! ,[Walks into a cactus], Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow...

We can't let Mr. Krabs go bankrupt! We must keep busy! Never giving up! ♪
,Squidward:, ♪ How did I not see this plan was a failure from the start? Being around SpongeBob is bad for my heart! And that's not even the worse part!

,Squidward:, Wow! That was actually, kinda good! ,[Notices the crowd cheering for them],
,Harold:, Amazing!
,Male Fish:, Fantastic!
,Mr. Krabs:, Unbelievable! They actually gathered a crowd! To think that all of these people came out to the middle of the desert to see Squidward and SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, Or...they came to see the meteor shower that passes through the Aurora Borealis generating a stunning, once-in-a-lifetime light show.
,Crowd:, ,[Looking at the beautiful sky], Oh....ah....
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Sets up a stand], Thank you! Come again, please! ,[Puts money in the register, then in the bag], He he he!

"[SpongeBob is carrying a big sack of snail food],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, What are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.
,Patrick:, How is Gary?
,SpongeBob:, He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.
,Patrick:, Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh... ,[SpongeBob is gone], Who was I talking to?
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts the bag of snail food down and notices a piece of paper on the door], Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. ""Dear Sir or Ma'am... ,[goes inside], We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience."" ,[doorbell rings], Hello? ,[gasps], My package. Whoopee! ,[takes it inside while leaving the bag of snail food outside], Oh, let's see what we got here. ,[cuts it open], My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah! ,[grunts], What's this? ""Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row."" Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge. ,[takes the ball and hits it on the paddle, but it comes back and hits him in the eye], Darn it. ,[Tries again; results are the same], Darn it. ,[this happens again], Darn it.
,Gary:, ,[goes into the kitchen and sees that his food bowl is empty. He checks the time and it is snack time], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[paddleball hits him in the eye again], Darn it.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, What was that?
,Gary:, ,[louder], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. ,[when he tries the paddleball again, Gary interrupts],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble. ,[when he lifts his paddleball up, Gary is attached to it],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion. ,[Dirty Bubble on the box laughs], Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it. ,[Gary slithers off], Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying. ,[Gary jumps on SpongeBob's face, making him run around and scream], Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get! ,[throws him away and grunts], And leave your master to his important affairs. ,[Gary rolls into his bowl and sees a crumb of food left. A bunch of spiders crawl out of it. Gary packs his things], Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.
,Gary:, Meow. ,[Gary slithers off away, down a river, and takes a bus out of town. Cut to next day],
,Patrick:, ,[drinks his coffee, then eats the cup], I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him. ,[knocks on the door, then notices the bag of snail food on the ground], That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand. ,[walks in], Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[muffled], Darn it.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, is that you?
,SpongeBob:, ,[muffled], Oh, darn it. Darn it.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob? ,[opens the door to the galley to SpongeBob lying on the ground],
,SpongeBob:, Darn it. Darn it.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, what happened? ,[runs over to a picture of a Krabby Patty on the wall], This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at the paddle], Darn it.
,Patrick:, Snap out of it.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I...
,Patrick:, What is it, buddy? You can tell me.
,SpongeBob:, I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.
,Patrick:, You what?! ,[cries],
,SpongeBob:, Why are you crying, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Patrick:, Uh-huh.
,SpongeBob:, What happened?
,Patrick:, I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.
,SpongeBob:, You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk.
,Patrick:, Thanks, buddy.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important? ,[trips over Gary's bowl], Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary. ,[gets the bag of snail food outside], That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours. ,[brings it in and pours it in Gary's bowl], Gary! Dinner! ,[takes out a triangle], Come on, Gary, soup's on. ,[rings it], Gary? Hey, Pat?
,Patrick:, Yeah?
,SpongeBob:, How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?
,Patrick:, About a week.
,SpongeBob:, A week? Are you sure?
,Patrick:, Hmmm... well... ,[pours the glass of milk upside down. The milk is revealed to be solid, which falls like jelly. Sniffs the jelly. Starts eating the solid milk, analyzing the taste closely. Makes a sour face after tasting the overly sour taste.], Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.
,SpongeBob:, Ten days? Gary! ,[searches all over the house for Gary], Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!
,Patrick:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[his eyes fill up with tears as his lip quivers], I can't find Gary.
,Gary:, ,[is slithering across the sand. Echoing howls are heard. Gary looks at his stomach and it's howling at him. Gary sneezes], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.
,Patrick:, Eight?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it. ,[Patrick shakes it, but it makes no noise], Let me see that. ,[SpongeBob tries it, but it still makes no noise], Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new... ,[Patrick belches. SpongeBob shakes his belly and Patrick laughs],
,Patrick:, I only tasted six types of sediment. ,[cut to nighttime where SpongeBob and Patrick are searching for Gary. Patrick is shaking his belly],
,SpongeBob:, Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here? ,[lifts a flower up], Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh. ,[jiggles his belly],
,SpongeBob:, Gary!
,Squidward:, What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick open Squidward's door while he is in the bathtub], ,[screams three times and pants],
,SpongeBob:, You check over there. I'll check in here. ,[checks in the bathtub Squidward is in], Find him yet, Pat?
,Patrick:, ,[pulls the sink out from the wall, making water shoot out everywhere], No, but I'll keep looking.
,SpongeBob:, ,[teary-eyed], But there's nowhere left to look.
,Patrick:, There's one place we haven't checked. ,[cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in front of the former's mailbox full of letters],
,SpongeBob:, I doubt Gary could fit in there.
,Patrick:, Can't hurt to look.
,SpongeBob:, Here goes nothing. ,[opens the mailbox and a bunch of letters shoot out and a rolled up paper falls on the ground], Look, Pat!
,Patrick:, What is it?
,SpongeBob:, Let's see. ""Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me."" Dear Neptune, what have I done?
,Patrick:, What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.
,SpongeBob:, Gary. ,[cut to Gary slithering into another town. A couple walks by him laughing, then sees Fred and Debbie Rechid eating inside a diner],
,Fred:, Are my pants too tight, dear? ,[takes a bite out of his burger, then notices Gary outside and closes the blinds on the window as they both laugh. Gary slithers along more until he stops and sees some nachos in an alleyway. When he is about to take a bite of it, three snails frighten him by hissing],
,Snail #1:, Look who came to dinner. ,[Gary runs away],
,Snail #3:, Guess he didn't like nachos. ,[Gary slithers away until he runs into a dark figure],
,Gramma:, There you are. ,[grabs Gary], There you are, Miss Tuffsy. Oh, gramma finally found you. She was starting to get worried. Now let's get to your home, Miss Tuffsy, and get you something to eat. Hmmm. ,[shakes Gary], You feel much lighter than Gramma remembers. ,[cut to Gramma's house where she is feeding Gary heart-shaped cookies and putting an electric blanket over him], There you go, Miss Tuffsy. Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.
,Gary:, Mmm.
,Gramma:, Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again. ,[Gary looks at a spoon collection and looks at a picture of snails], There you go. ,[puts some more cookies on], After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised. ,[drops empty cookie sheet], Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system. ,[music warbling faster as Gramma cranks the record player. Gary continues to eat cookies as jazz music begins to play], Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter. ,[dances], You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie. ,[while doing the dance, she breaks her back], Oh. ,[set Gary back on the chair], Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.
,SpongeBob:, Gary! Gary? Gary! ,[looks into a hat store. On the reflection of the window, a truck with a picture of a snail drives by and stops. SpongeBob turns around], Gary! ,[truck's logo says ""Hungry Snails Loves Snail-Po"". Tires squeal as the dust gets into SpongeBob's face and makes him cough], Gary...! ,[crying], Oh... Gary! ,[fade out to Gramma and Gary sitting on the couch watching TV],
,Gramma:, Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time. ,[clock reads 7:30], It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy. ,[when Gary jumps off the couch, a picture of SpongeBob comes out of his bag],
,Gary:, ,[sadly], Meow.
,Picture of SpongeBob:, Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy? ,[Gary gives a raspberry. Gary goes into a bright and decorated room with Gramma],
,Gramma:, Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.
,Gary:, ,[questioningly], Meow?
,Gramma:, Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh, ,[Gary's sad, precious round eyes sparkle up at Gramma], I almost forgot your good night kiss. ,[kisses Gary], Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy. ,[walks out of the room and claps twice to make the lights go out. Cut to next day at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is walking into the Krusty Krab on his knees. He has bloodshot eyes],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[snaps fingers], Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on. ,[puts his hat on his head], Knew I'd figure it out.
,SpongeBob:, ,[his tears drop on the patty], Gary.
,Evelyn:, Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.
,Mr. Krabs:, Refund?! What's wrong with it?
,Evelyn:, Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears! ,[reveals that there are six tears on the patty],
,Mr. Krabs:, What the...?
,SpongeBob:, Gary... ,[crying],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!
,SpongeBob:, This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.
,SpongeBob:, Well, you see...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs SpongeBob's mouth], That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's me boy!
,SpongeBob:, If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.
,Mr. Krabs:,  Wh...?
,[cut to Patrick sleeping on the ground. A bunch of things fall on Patrick and wake him up],
,Patrick:, It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.
,Patrick:, But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do. ,[cut to Gramma],
,Gramma:, ,[squeezing orange juice from the orange], There you go, Miss Tuffsy—fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.
,Gary:, Meow.
,Gramma:, How about a little more syrup on those pancakes? ,[pours syrup on the pancakes. Then takes the spoon and scoops up a bite for Gary], Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo! ,[cut to Gramma and Gary in the car], Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy. ,[engine revving, tires squeal as Gramma drives fast over to Martha's Craft Zone], Oh, here we are. ,[both walk inside. As soon as the door closes, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive in the front door with posters and tape],
,SpongeBob:, Here's a good spot. ,[puts a poster on the door], ""Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob"". Quick, hand me the tape.
,Patrick:, Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this is no time for that. ,[Patrick goes in. SpongeBob sighs],
,Patrick:, Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.
,Gramma:, These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.
,Patrick:, Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!
,Gramma:, Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.
,Patrick:, Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary. ,[walks out as Gary stares at him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[finishes putting up the posters], There.
,Patrick:, W,hen Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half], Um...uhh...
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out. ,[walk off],
,Gramma:, ,[walks out], Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.
,♪Gary, now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary. Gary, come home. Gary, can't you see I was blind, I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet, you're my best friend, too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word poem: Gary, come home!♪
,Patrick:, I want peanuts. ,[presses button in the airplane],
,SpongeBob:, Pat, no! ,[airplane loses control. Both scream as the airplane rides through the message in the sky ""GARY COME HOME"" and changes it to ""LISA, WILL YOU MARRY ME?""],
,Mable:, Who is this 'Lisa' person?
,Lenny:, What? ,[Mable slaps him. Cut to Gramma walking into her house],
,Gramma:, Gramma will get a lovely meat loaf in the oven for you.
,Gary:, Meow.
,Gramma:, Don't worry, it's no trouble at all. Easy to do. ,[Gary smells his newspaper pile],
,Gary:, Meow.
,Gramma:, Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy. ,[Gary reads all the fliers that SpongeBob and Patrick made. Gary imagines SpongeBob in a thought bubble],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go! ,[Gramma whistles],
,Gramma:, You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done. ,[Gary groans, then slithers over and opens a closet door to find a bunch of empty snail shells], Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies. ,[belt on Gary's belly snaps. A bunch of fat breaks through his shell. The snails in the painting on the wall talk],
,Snails in picture:, Run! ,[Gary strains to get out of the shell pile, but does and rolls toward Gramma's cookie plate and out the pet door. She tries to throw cookies at him, but they get stuck in the door],
,Gramma:, You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too. ,[Gary looks behind him and Gramma is slowly walking behind him], Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love. ,[Gary hides behind some trashcans in the alleyway], Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.
,Snail #3:, Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.
,Gramma:, Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling. ,[Gary pushes Snail #3 out into the sidewalk],
,Snail #3:, Hey!
,Gramma:, Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.
,Snail #3:, Who?
,Gramma:, You must be starving. ,[Gary sighs deeply. Cut to SpongeBob crying on his couch],
,Patrick:, Just let it out, buddy. That's right.
,SpongeBob:, I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.
,Patrick:, Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood! [SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] They were awesome!
,SpongeBob:, Gary loves balsa wood! ,[runs off crying], I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind. ,[look at the giant sign of Gary], I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.
,Gary:, ,[climbs on SpongeBob's head], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, like that. ,[Gary purrs], Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary! [He kisses Gary] So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.

,SpongeBob:, Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. ,[takes off his uniform], I hardly knew ya. ,[gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened],
,Mrs. Puff:, Uhh... SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
,SpongeBob:, A-hoo! ,[dives into the uniform], Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
,Mrs. Puff:, What are the consequences of what I've just done? ,[cut to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. Then notices a broken traffic light],
,SpongeBob:, Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! ,[directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end], What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
,Fred:, My leg! My leg!
,SpongeBob:, On patrol. I'm on patrol. ,[notices a house with an open window], Uh-oh, an open window. ,[peeks through the window and there is a couple eating],
,Vera:, More seaweed medley, dear?
,SpongeBob:, The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. ,[jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so], I'm the open window maniac! ,[both run out screaming], I hope you learned a valuable lesson! ,[shuts the window and begins walking again], On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... ,[gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground], Vandals! Another crime. ,[takes his finger and tastes the pink goo], hmm...strawberry! I must act! ,[more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream], Patrick... ,[looks around for the voice he just heard], Patrick... Patrick...
,Patrick:, My ice cream! It's alive! ,[screams and throws away the ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Down here!
,Patrick:, Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. ,[ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick. Come down here. ,[Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I'm down here.
,Patrick:, Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, That's hall monitor to you!
,Patrick:, Sorry, officer.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
,Patrick:, What crime? ,[shows him the ice cream that is on the ground], I'm ,a, bad person! ,[cries],
,Newspaper Boy:, ,[High Voice], Extra! Extra! ""Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!"" City paralyzed with fear! ,[gives one to SpongeBob], ,[Gruff Voice], Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. ,[runs off], ,[High voice again], Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
,SpongeBob:, ,[reads paper], ""Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?"". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
,Patrick:, ,[still crying], I wanna be good!
,SpongeBob:, Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. ,[Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head], Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
,Patrick:, Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! ,[both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, now what?
,Patrick:, Hmmm... ,[both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! ,[takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy], And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! ,[SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick],
,Officer Rob:, Afternoon, son.
,Patrick:, Hello, brothers. ,[salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat],
,Officer Rob:, Son, we're looking for the maniac.
,Officer John:, Have you seen THIS MAN?! ,[He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!
,Officer Rob:, Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand?
,Patrick:, Yeah, uh-huh.
,Officer Rob:, Okay. ,[Officer John shows Patrick the poster again],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], Horrible!
,[Officer John removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Officer John repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.],
,Officer Rob:, Stay indoors, son.
,Officer John:, And, uhh, take that cone off your head. ,[both laugh as they drive off],
,Patrick:, ,[takes out walkie-talkie], SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
,Patrick:, ,[over walkie-talkie], I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!
,SpongeBob:, Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
,Patrick:, ,[over walkie-talkie, sobbing], I wanna go home!
,SpongeBob:, Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
,Patrick:, Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... ,[the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark], ...dark.
,SpongeBob:, Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
,Patrick:, Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. ,[Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it], [gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
,SpongeBob:, ,[over walkie-talkie], Where is he, Patrick?
,Patrick:, ,[over walkie-talkie], At the intersection of Conch and Coral. ,[SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign],
,SpongeBob:, That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
,Patrick:, Uhh, he's just standing there... MENACINGLY! ,[screams over walkie-talkie], GET OUT OF THERE, SPONGEBOB! ,[SpongeBob screams], THAT'S HIS MANIAC SHRIEK! HE'S GOING TO ATTACK! ,[SpongeBob cries while running around in circles], He's acting all crazy! RUN! HIDE BEHIND THAT BUILDING! ,[SpongeBob hides behind the building], NO, HE'S BEHIND THAT BUILDING! OH, QUICK, HIDE BEHIND THAT STREET SIGN! ,[SpongeBob hides behind the street sign], NO WAIT! THE MANIAC JUST WENT BEHIND THAT SIGN! QUICK! GET UNDER THE STREET LIGHT! ,[SpongeBob gets under the street lights], NO WAIT, AGH, HE'S THERE, TOO! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! ,[SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out],
,SpongeBob:, ,[over walkie-talkie], Say again, deputy?
,Patrick:, THE MANIAC'S IN THE MAILBOX! ,[SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through three buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plasted with wanted posters],
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes a look at a wanted poster], Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, ,I'm, the maniac! ,[Patrick screams in the background and a mass of police cars surround SpongeBob],
,Officer Durado:, We'll take that as a confession. ,[Mrs. Puff appears],
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! ,[SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words],
,Officer #1:, You know this guy?
,Mrs. Puff:, Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. ,[the cops glare at her], Uh-oh... ,[at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV], And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, ,[frowns nervously], Yes, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now! ,[jail closure sound],

,SpongeBob:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
,SpongeBob:, ,[as he talks to Squidward, his voice gets higher and higher and starts talking faster until the shellphone completely disappears], Squidward! Help me!

,Patrick:, ,[Patrick tries to hit a nail into a board, but hits his hand instead], Ow! Ow! Ow! ,[SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say ""Ow!"" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. Next, shown SpongeBob's finished house, shown also with sparkles],
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb], We're done!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! So what do you think?

,Patrick:, Tartar sauce.

,Patrick:, Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
,SpongeBob:, That'd be great!

The wind blows and Patrick shivers, he then pulls the rock closer to him, SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as they keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles, then spits out the cork],
,Patrick:, ,[in his sleep], A spider! Spiders! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! ,[lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it several times, he then goes back to sleep],

,Mrs. SquarePants:, SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
,Mr. SquarePants:, Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Mom.
,Squidward:, Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. ,[picks up the bags and carries them to the car],
,SpongeBob:, Just give me a minute. ,[walks back to where his house used to be], I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. ,[buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be], You hold too many memories. ,[as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand], Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. ,[walks away],
,Squidward:, Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. ,[dances], Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. ,[Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the car],

The stem then goes back into the ground],
,SpongeBob:, My house is back! ,[SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple], Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! ,[continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house.

,SpongeBob:, ,[gets out of his mailbox and rips the packaging off the box that came in the mail], Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit. ,[opens the box and gasps], Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic. ,[notices Squidward to the side slurping a drink], Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.
,Squidward:, Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz. ,[eats a seaweed crisp], Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten.

It's Squidward! ,[ice cream begins to melt as SpongeBob is unaware], And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged. ,[Patrick is licking the melted ice cream off the floor.

,Horace:, Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.
,Mister Magic:, ,[simultaneously with Horace], Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.

,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?
,Horace:, Well, I... uh... I'm Horace B. Magic.
,SpongeBob:, Are you Mister Magic?
,Horace:, ,[chuckles], Technically, yes. But the only magic around here is the magic of business. ,[shows a bunch of dollar bills],
,SpongeBob:, Does that mean you can't change my friend back?
,Horace:, ,[chuckles], I'm, I'm afraid not. So sorry about that, laddie. Your refund check is in the mail.
,SpongeBob:, I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways! ,[his eyes tear up], You have ruined my faith in the magical arts. ,[screaming, crying],

Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!... ,[continues to speak gibberish as a bus drives up and Squidward steps off, grinning in a friendly manner. He walks over to the lawn chair with the jar and the melted green ice cream, much to his disgust],
,Squidward:, Ew. ,[throws the jar with the cone in it away. The jar breaks], What are you doing, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops crying], Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked. ,[puts on his magician hat], I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now? ,[motorcycle approaches],
,Squidward:, Hey, stop! ,[motorcycle stops and Squidward jumps on it], Get me out of here!
,Patrick:, ,[stomach growls], Hey, SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?
,SpongeBob:, Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica. ,[Patrick is now a giant jar of mayonnaise. The jar sparkles],

"[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where a large crowd of people is gathered to watch SpongeBob perform his latest stunt: To become the first sponge to high dive up to the surface.],
,Perch Perkins:, Perch Perkins here for Bikini Bottom News. Today, SpongeBob SquarePants will attempt the impossible: a high-sea dive from that diving board! ,[points to the diving board on the side of SpongeBob's house], He'll be the first sponge ever to dive up through the ocean.
,[Inside the house, Gary is spreading lard all over SpongeBob's body.],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Did you hear what Perch said, Gary? The first sponge!

,Monroe Timmy:, Whoa.
,SpongeBob Statue:, ,[comes to life], Pretty cool, huh, kid? ,[winks],
,[Monroe Timmy screams and runs away. The daydream ends. SpongeBob sucks the little buoy in his lard-covered body.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Gary, that's enough lard. I gotta warm up.
,[SpongeBob slides over to the barbells. He goes to lift it up, but his arms keep slipping off. He ties his arms on the barbell and proceeds to lift it up. The weight of the barbell causes SpongeBob to fall over and it falls off his arms. The barbell is sent flying and crashing through the wall.],
,SpongeBob:, That's good. I'm all warmed up.
,[Mr. Krabs is outside selling SpongeBob-themed products.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Get your SpongeBob standees here! Buy one and take home a hero! ,[holds a standee up for Nat Peterson], Here you are, ,[hits Nat with the standee], here! ,[hits him again], Here!
,Patrick:, ,[walks up and sees a standee of SpongeBob], Hey, SpongeBob. What's new? ,[silence; Patrick gets mad], Oh, so that's how it is, huh? The silent treatment. Well, two can play at that game, mister! ,[huffs and pouts],
,Bubble Bass:, Excuse me. How much for this stupid starfish standee?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm? Hmm. ,[giggles as makes a greedy face], 20 bucks?
,Bubble Bass:, ,[grunts as he pulls Patrick's left arm off], But it's damaged.
,Mr. Krabs:, 10 bucks? ,[giggles],
,Bubble Bass:, ,[holds up money], Sold!
,[Bubble Bass gives Mr. Krabs the money. Mr. Krabs' eyelids eats the money and he burps out a receipt from his mouth. The crowd continues to chatter as they wait for SpongeBob to perform his stunt.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[pops out from the window], Hi-uh! ,[sticks himself on the diving board, but he's upside down; he pulls out his little buoy from his head],
,Perch Perkins:, And here's our hero now with the flag he will plant on the surface.
,[The crowd cheers.],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! ,[goes to the end of the diving board as drumroll is being played; he attempts to perform his stunt, but since he was upside-down, he falls to the ground], Ahh! Ooh.
,[The crowd groans and leaves in disappointment.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Get your SpongeBob standees right here. Buy one and take home a loser. ,[chortles],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets up], I just don't understand it. Surface divers go down. Why didn't I go up?
,Sandy:, Well, back in Texas, Olympic divers have gravity to help them go down. What you need is anti-gravity to go up.
,SpongeBob:, Anti-gravity? Yes! ,[pops lightbulbs out from his body], Yah! ,[sucks the lightbulbs in his body and giggles],
,[SpongeBob runs back in his house. Then he comes back out on the diving board with balloons tied around his waist.],
,Squidward:, ,[picks up trash around his house], Hmph. Stupid messy moron rubbernecking flounders and so on...
,[SpongeBob goes to perform his stunt and successfully dives off the diving board. The balloons help him float in the air while Squidward continues grumbling as he picks up the trash.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
,[SpongeBob floats into a swarm of jellyfish. Jellyfish fly around him as he continues floating to the surface. They make a stairway for him and SpongeBob climbs higher and higher.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm the first high-sea-diving sponge. ,[pulls out the little buoy from his nose],
,[But just when he was about to reach the surface, a pile of garbage blocks everything. The balloons pop and SpongeBob holds onto a rope.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, what happened to the surface?
,[The screen zooms up to Bikini Atol where the garbage reveals itself as the Great Pacific garbage patch, floating on the surface and eventually causing water pollution.],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm. Huh? ,[attaches himself to the garbage with the suction cups], Aw, gee, and I was so close. ,[kicks a bolt and it falls upward], Hmm? What is this place? ,[puts his little buoy in his head],
,[SpongeBob searches around the trash. He climbs on an old television and slides down.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh!
,[SpongeBob climbs on an old telephone receiver and it falls upward. He puts on a bowtie.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,[SpongeBob strums on the giant comb like a harp. He giggles and the comb falls upward. SpongeBob climbs on another pile of trash.],
,SpongeBob:, This place is trash-tastic! ,[pounds on his chest and does a Tarzan-like yell; suddenly, someone throws a large key in SpongeBob's face.], Ow! ,[dodges an incoming pen], Oh, hey now! Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh-oh! ,[bumps into a giant car pump and it falls upward],

,Dave:, What's that?
,[The giant comb floats down.],
,Evelyn:, I don't know.
,[The comb lands in front of a farmer.],
,Farmer:, Hmm. ,[grunts as he picks up the comb],
,[The farmer places the comb on the back of the tractor. He climbs in the tractor and drives it. The comb is being used as a chisel plow and plants begin to sprout.],
,Thaddeus:, It's a gift!
,Evelyn:, From the sky?
,Dave:, From Neptune!
,[A group of boy scout campers are setting up a tent.],
,Boy Scout Campers:, Yay! ,[the tent falls apart], Aww.

,Groom:, Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Look at that!
,Bride:, Now there's room for my mother!
,Groom:, Whaa?
,[The screen pans out and reveals really tall mother with her packages.],
,Bride's Mother:, Ehh...
,[Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob is still wandering around.],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm? I thought I saw something over—,[gets hit by a giant plastic spoon], Ow! ,[sees a shadowy figure], Hello? Who are you?
,[The mysterious figure comes out and reveals himself to be none other than Old Man Jenkins.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, I'm King Neptune! Feel my power! ,[throws a paperclip at SpongeBob],

,Old Man Jenkins:, I'm not Old Man Jenkins anymore! I'm King Neptune! Take that! ,[throws a bottle cap at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[whimpers as he dodges the bottle cap], Huh? All right, I'll play along. Hey, King Neptune! I'm Poseidon! ,[laughs and throws a giant sandal at Old Man Jenkins],
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[dodges sandal], Oh!
,[Old Man Jenkins grabs a giant eraser and throws it at SpongeBob. The two of them get into a trash fight and the thrown trash are being floated down to Bikini Bottom from above. A butter knife floats down to a local business man.],
,Business Man:, Hmm? Neptune is blessing us with gifts and treasures! ,[changes into his bathing suit], Surf's up, dude!
,[Debbie and Nat are driving in a boat. Suddenly, a giant vacuum cleaner crashes down onto their boat. They both giggle and hop onto the vacuum. They drive the vacuum all over Bikini Bottom.],
,Nat Peterson:, Oh, yeah! All right! Ho-ho!
,[A group of people gather around and a little girl is holding a bunch of balloons.],
,Little Girl #1:, You say your desire into the balloon, blow it up, and send it to Neptune. ,[whispers], A slice of pizza. ,[blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface],
,Cara:, ,[stretches balloon and speaks into it], A never-ending roll of toilet paper. ,[blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface],
,Little Girl #2:, ,[stretches balloon and speaks into it], A million grandmas. ,[blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface],
,[Sooner or later, many balloons are floating upward to the surface. Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins grow tired from their garbage fight. Old Man Jenkins walks up to SpongeBob and looks at him closely.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, You're not Poseidon. You're SpongeBob SquarePants.
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up a mirror], And you're Old Man Jenkins!
,Old Man Jenkins:, I was Old Man Jenkins 'til I came here. It was a year ago today...
,[A flashback is shown with Old Man Jenkins celebrating his birthday with some elderly friends at Shady Shoals Rest Home.],
,Senior Citizens:, ♪Happy birthday to you♪
,[One of Old Man Jenkins' friends gives him a bunch of balloons.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Oh, thank you, dea— ,[begins to float away with the balloons], Hello? Some help, please?
,Senior Citizens:, ,[grumble and head back into the rest home], So now I gotta go back? I came all the way over here.
,Old Man Jenkins:, Hey—hey, come back here! Come back, now!
,[The flashback ends. Just then, a yellow balloon appears and pops next to SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins, surprising them.],
,Voice #1:, Neptune, I want a mustache.
,[Another balloon appears and pops.],
,Voice #2:, Neptune, I want a cool voice.
,[Another balloon appears. SpongeBob catches the balloon and pops.],
,Patrick:, ,[voiceover], Neptune, I want another balloon.

,Patrick:, ,[voiceover], Now!

,SpongeBob:, Well, we could build a ladder out of this stuff and climb down—ooh, uh, down?
,Old Man Jenkins:, What are you, senile?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-uh. I'm juvenile! ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob begins to grab several trash and stacks them up one by one in order to make a ladder to climb back down. Meanwhile, back down on the ground, the townsfolk are starting to get worried.],
,Citizen #1:, Hey, what happened?
,Citizen #2:, What's going on here?
,Harold:, Why isn't Neptune sending us more gifts down for us?
,Debbie Rechid:, We must have upset him.
,Harold:, You must have upset him! ,[the townsfolk strap Debbie to a death table and is prepared to be killed], This is for you, Neptune! Oohh— ,[prepares to kill her until...],
,Debbie Rechid:, Wait! Look!
,[SpongeBob's ladder made out of the garbage descends downward. The crowd gasps and murmurs in amazement.],
,Citizen #3:, Oh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
,Citizen #4:, What is it?
,Debbie Rechid:, What do you think it is?
,Harold:, It's a ladder from Neptune! Let's climb up and get more free stuff!
,Debbie Rechid:, Me first! ,[buffs up her muscles and breaks free],
,[Debbie runs up to the trash ladder and begins to climb it. Then several other townsfolk join in and follow her up the trash ladder. SpongeBob grabs an old soup can and finishes the ladder. The surface is now sparkly clean from the garbage patch.],
,SpongeBob:, Phew! It took every piece of the island to make this ladder. Ooh? Hey! Look at that! ,[pulls the little buoy out of his head and sticks it to the surface], I'm the first sponge to ever do that!
,Old Man Jenkins:, Big whoop.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yes! It's the biggest whoop! Let's go home!
,[SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins begin to climb down to the ocean floor. Suddenly, the ladder starts shaking.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Stop shaking the ladder!
,SpongeBob:, I'm not shaking it!
,[Down below the ladder, the townsfolk continue to climb up until they see SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins above.],
,Debbie Rechid:, I think I see him! It's Neptune!
,Fred:, Oh, Neptune!
,Citizens:, Neptune! Out of my way!
,[The townsfolk climb upward but suddenly stop.],
,Debbie Rechid:, Wait a minute. ,[sees Old Man Jenkins climbing down], It's Old Man Jenkins!
,Nat Peterson:, Old Man Jenkins is Neptune?
,Dale:, All hail Old Man Jenkins!
,Old Man Jenkins:, Get off my trash, you idiots!
,Dale:, Praise Neptune! We're all idiots for you!
,Citizens:, We're all idiots! We're all idiots!
,[The townsfolk's cheering causes the ladder to shake, knocking over SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh-whaa! ,[clings onto another box],
,Debbie Rechid:, Hey, it's SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Everybody climb back down! There's nothing up there! ,[climbs down to the townsfolk], I dove up and found Old Man Jenkins living among all these objects.
,Debbie Rechid:, Then it was you that sent these treasures down!
,Nat Peterson:, Hooray for SpongeBob! He's our hero!
,[The townsfolk cheer. But their cheering shakes the ladder even more.],
,SpongeBob:, No! Ahh! Ohh—ow!
,[The ladder crumbles and all of the trash as well as SpongeBob, Old Man Jenkins, and the townsfolk are sent crashing down to Bikini Bottom. The city is now a complete mess with trash.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[pops out from the trash, grabs a bottle cap and a fork, and stands on Nat Peterson's head], I'm King Neptune! King of the seven seas, the lakes, rivers, puddles...,[spits saliva into a spittoon], And spit too! I'm the king of spit!
,King Neptune:, So you're the king of spit?
,[Thunder roars],
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[Nervously],Uh-oh.
,[Out from the clouds, the real King Neptune appears on his chariot and he's not very happy.],
,King Neptune:, ""Uh-oh"" is right.
,[Old Man Jenkins stands scared as Nat Peterson, upon seeing the real King Neptune, whimpers in fear. He grabs a suitcase and runs away. King Neptune ignites his trident and zaps Old Man Jenkins, burning him to a crisp.],
,Old Man Jenkins:, I smell like toast. Am I breakfast? ,[bites off his hand], Needs jelly.
,[Mr. Krabs comes by and notices the pile of trash. He also notices SpongeBob's hands sticking out from underneath.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm? ,[pulls out a mortally wounded SpongeBob], Ooh, well, look at that. Someone threw away a good SpongeBob standee. ,[laughs and throws SpongeBob in his truck-load of SpongeBob-standees], Yagh! ,[closes the trunk], Oof! ,[climbs in the truck], Ugh.

,SpongeBob:, What's that?
,Patrick:, What's hide-and-seek? ,[Bubble transition changes the scene],
,SpongeBob:, ,[with socks on his hands], You think you're getting it now, Patrick? Did you find the sock puppet demonstration to be useful?
,Patrick:, Hide-and-seek: a game played by two or more players in which one player chosen at random counts aloud to a pre-determined number while the remaining players hide. Upon reaching said number, the counting player now embarks on a search for the other players. ,[SpongeBob takes his socks off his hands and puts them back on his feet], The search continues until all players are located and a winner is determined.

,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick, come on. Of course we can play!
,Patrick:, Oh no! I can't! ,[sobbing in despair],

,SpongeBob:, Now I'm all over, where am I gonna hide? ,[Looks to the right, then the left], Hmmm. ,[Lifts his finger up, then puts his finger in his mouth and sticks out his tongue before licking his finger and puts the finger in and out], That's definitely one idea.
,Patrick:, Seventy-eight, seventy-nine, a hundred! Four! A-ha! I found you. I win, I win, I win! In your face! ,[Pokes SpongeBob in the face], I must be the best hide-and-seek player ever!
,SpongeBob:, All right, it's my turn to count. You know what you're supposed to do right?

,SpongeBob:, Right. Here I go. ,[covers eyes], One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
,Patrick:, ,[thinking], Do you hear that? No, what is that? Oh, it's SpongeBob. Why is he counting? I guess I'll just go home, maybe or later he'll want to play a game, or something.
,SpongeBob:, Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty... ,[Patrick lifts up his rock and jumps in], Ninety-nine, ,[uncovers eyes], a hundred! Now where is he hiding? ,[Looks at Patrick's rock], Nah, way too obvious. ,[Walks away, little realizing that Patrick was taking out his trash], Come out, come out wherever you are! ,[Looks behind kelp and through a rock, but the rock is upside down a flower springs behind him], Patrick! ,[Sees something that looks like Patrick's head, sticking out of the ground], Patrick! ,[Lifts his head up, but it is brain coral], This is gonna be harder than I thought.

,Mr. Krabs:, It's not that! It's just that you haven't paid the fee.
,SpongeBob:, The fee?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, you know. The Krusty Krab Hide-and-Go Seekers' Fee. For playing hide-and-seek on Krusty Krab premises.

,SpongeBob:, I'm ready!
,Patrick:, Who's ready?
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready!
,Patrick:, Who's ready?
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! ,[runs toward the Krusty Krab. A squid is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows.],
,Squidward:, ,[cleaning graffiti of himself with the word ""loser,"" sees SpongeBob, and sighs], Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
,SpongeBob:, ,[in background, at first while Squidward was talking], I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self! ,[Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside.],
,Squidward:, ,[While SpongeBob says, ""I'm ready,"" one more time in the background], Mr. Krabs! ,[cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.], Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- ,[interrupted by SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Permission to come aboard, captain. ,[deep voice], I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew ,[normal voice], and now I'm ready. ,[SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.], So, uh, when do I start?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. ,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, ,[deep breath], No. ,[Mr. Krabs winks. They head back to SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... ,[SpongeBob takes out a notepad], a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula... ,[SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says], with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, ,[more scribbling], and, uh... turbo drive. ,[more scribbling], And don't come back ‘til you get one. ,[Mr. Krabs puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile],
,SpongeBob:, ,[saluting Krabs], Aye aye, captain! ,[reading], One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!
,Mr. Krabs:, Carry on! ,[SpongeBob leaves], We'll never see that lubber again.
,Squidward:, You're terrible. A hydro-what? ,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Krabs laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.],
,Bus driver:, Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their hands out the window! ,[The buses surround the Krusty Krab and the doors open; Mr. Krabs stops laughing.],
,Mr. Krabs:, That sounded like hatch doors. ,[sniffs repeatedly], Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. A smelly smell that smells... smelly. ,[bulgy eyes], Anchovies.
,Squidward:, What?
,Mr. Krabs:, Anchovies! ,[Anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word ""meep"" over and over again],
,Squidward:, Please, please, quiet! ,[anchovies stop talking], Is this any way to behave, hmmm?
,Anchovy:, Meep!
,Squidward:, Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? ,[The anchovies are quiet at first, then pick up the boat, as their cries of ""meep!"" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[singing to himself], ♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪  ,[cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.],
,Mr. Krabs:, All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
,Squidward:, One single file line was all I asked!
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa! ,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward are thrown up in the air],  Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! ,[they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters], We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward! ,[they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward], I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! ,[cuts to Barg'N-Mart],
,SpongeBob:, ,[singing], ♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪ ,[cuts back to the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, Help!
,Mr. Krabs:, Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! ,[They climb the mast, while the anchovies try to get them down. The anchovies then form a big wave.],
,Anchovies:, Meep! Meep!
,Mr. Krabs:, This is the end! Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
,Squidward:, Oh, Mr. Krabs! ,[They cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune],
,SpongeBob:, Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
,Squidward and Mr. Krabs:, ,[stuttering while shocked at the SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula],
,SpongeBob:, That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with ,[two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one], port-and-starboard attachments, and lets not forget the turbo drive! ,[the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face], Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! ,[to the anchovies], Who's hungry?! ,[Tiny Tim's ""Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight"" plays while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the opening window to the hungry anchovies. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses. Cuts to later.],
,Mr. Krabs:, That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. ,[Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a name tag],
,Squidward:, B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
,Mr. Krabs:, Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
,Squidward:, ,[weakly], Hooray, Mr.-
,Mr. Krabs:, Hip-hip.
,Squidward:, ,[quickly], Hooray. M-
,Mr. Krabs:, Hip-hip.
,Squidward:, ,[quickly], Hooray. Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. ,[He wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. Patrick enters],
,Patrick:, Good morning, Krusty Krew!
,Squidward:, What would you like to order, Patrick?
,Patrick:, One Krabby Patty, please. ,[The instrumental to ""Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight"" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula, and a score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which collide with Patrick and send him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.],
,Patrick:, ,[screams],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! ,[calmly and singing], Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee.

"[Mr. Krabs is in his office counting his money],
,Mr. Krabs:, Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty-three, four hundred and fifty-four, four hundred and fifty-five, four hundred and fifty-si... ,[hurts himself], Ow! No! ,[sucks claw], Ooh! ,[close up on Mr. Krabs' nail], I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible. ,[dials number], Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them! ,[frustrated], No! Can you just schedule me in? ,[shocked], Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day? ,[whispers], But what if the guys see me? ,[stops whispering], Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there. ,[takes secret underground passage to the front door and bumps into SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret.
,SpongeBob:, ,[shocked], You have a secret?
,Mr. Krabs:, Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes. ,[looks at his nail], Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cuticles. ,[notices SpongeBob is listening and puts his hands behind his back],
,SpongeBob:, Aye-aye, sir. And who will be ""in charge"" while you're gone.
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, ,[looks over at Squidward], well, not Squidward. ,[looks at a customer], No, no, him. ,[looks at another customer], Too lumpy. ,[looks at SpongeBob, who shines], Okay, okay, you're in charge.
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Mr. Krabs:, You're in charge for the next 15 minutes.
,SpongeBob:, I'm... in charge?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, sure, why not? ,[SpongeBob starts shaking], You okay, boy?
,SpongeBob:, ,[flies around, leaving a rainbow trail behind], Yahow! ,[lands and salutes], I won't let you down, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes ,[Mr. Krabs leaves, Squidward is sleeping, and SpongeBob wakes him up],
,SpongeBob:, Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?
,Squidward:, Krabs is gone?
,SpongeBob:, Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes.
,Squidward:, Wow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[giggles] ,Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge. ,[close-up of Squidward not listening three times] ,Charge. ,[sings], Charge. ,[Squidward falls asleep],
,Squidward:, Wake me up when I care. ,[SpongeBob looks at his watch],
,SpongeBob:, Do you care now?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at the customers and gasps], Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your Krabby Patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle. ,[tries to wake Squidward up], Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?
,Squidward:, ,[yells], What?!
,SpongeBob:, Well, it's just that I'm in charge and...
,Squidward:, ,[growls...but then gets an idea], And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?
,SpongeBob:, Regulary scheduled nap?
,Squidward:, This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Squidward:, But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sweating], Well, I, um...
,Squidward:, What is it?
,SpongeBob:, Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of procedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab. ,[Squidward laughs then cuts to the scene where Squidward is watching TV],
,SpongeBob:, Order up, Squidward!
,Squidward:, You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on.
,SpongeBob:, Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties. ,[raises his spatula],
,Squidward:, So do it when you're done.
,SpongeBob:, And unclog the sink.
,Squidward:, Would you like to hear a secret?
,SpongeBob:, ,[appears right behind Squidward and slightly shocks Squidward], What kind of secret?
,Squidward:, See that guy over there? ,[points],
,SpongeBob:, Yes?
,Squidward:, He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!
,SpongeBob:, Me?
,Squidward:, Why don't you give him a couple of pointers? Let him cook his own patty, and don't take ""no"" for an answer. He's shy. ,[laughs], This should be good.
,[SpongeBob walks up to Frank and nudges him],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, buddy. It's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire.
,Frank:, Uhh... Hello.
,SpongeBob:, I know your secret...
,Frank:, What? Who told you?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, a little cashier told me! Follow me!
,Frank:, Yeah, whatever you say, man!
,[he takes him by the hand and leads him into the kitchen],
,Squidward:, Moron.
,[in the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya?
,Frank:, No.
,SpongeBob:, First off, this is my grill. This is where the magic happens! And this is my actual spatula! ,[shows him the objects], So start fryin' up some patties! I'll come check on you later, my little prodigy!
,Squidward:, Ha, ha! SpongeBob will believe anything!
,[SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Order number 12!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what're you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Taking out an order!
,Squidward:, You're serving Krabby Patties with your hands? Do you know how filthy your hands are?
,SpongeBob:, They are?
,Squidward:, Your feet, however, are clean. Think about it. Your feet have been protected by your shoes and socks all day.
,SpongeBob:, Oh! ,[he takes his shoe and sock off, then we see a close-up of his foot with a band-aid, and blisters],. It's all coming clear to me now. ,[cut to the next scene where SpongeBob is walking on his hands and serving a customer with his feet, on one foot there is a Krabby Patty, and on his other foot there is a drink], One Krabby Meal served with extra sanitary foot service. Your hot, steamy, juicy Krabby Patty, and a large drink. ,[he puts a straw in the drink by using his toes, then he bends the straw with his big toe, the customer flinches], Enjoy.
,Debbie:, Hey, is my food here yet?
,Frankie Billy:, ,[hands over Krabby Patty and drink], Here. You can have mine.
,Delivery Man:, Here are the supplies you've order!
,Squidward:, What? ,[delivery man squishes Squidward with the items],
,Delivery Man:, Please sign here. ,[Squidward signs his name], Hey, my pen.
,Squidward:, Oh, sorry.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! ,[sings], It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob. What is all this junk?
,SpongeBob:, Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty!
,Squidward:, Yeah, have fun with that.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hands Squidward some supplies], Oh, Squidward. I'm in charge, so you'll be having all the fun.
,Squidward:, Doing what?
,SpongeBob:, ,[quickly counting his fingers],Painting the walls, buffing the tables, sewing pretty curtains, washing the windows, varnishing the stools, hanging the ferns, waxing the toilets. Oh, you lucky dog!
,Squidward:, ,[grunts and gets an idea], Hey, SpongeBob, do you want to hear another Krusty Krab secret?
,SpongeBob:, There's another secret? What's the secret?
,Squidward:, Do you want to know how Mr. Krabs gets all these customers?
,SpongeBob:, How?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs keeps this place a dump, so the food's more better by comparison!
,SpongeBob:, Sounds like the Chum Bucket.
,Squidward:, Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose.
,SpongeBob:, Oh... ,[cut to SpongeBob dumping garbage from trash cans all over the tables while Squidward watches and sipping a soda], How's this, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Lookin' good!
,SpongeBob:, You mean, ""lookin' bad!"" Enjoy our fine décor!
,Nat:, Next time, I'm picking the restaurant.
,[SpongeBob mops the Krusty Krab with muck and grime, until it is totally covered in brown goop],
,SpongeBob:, One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!
,Squidward:, Mmm, you missed a spot.
,[he mops a customer and his food],
,SpongeBob:, Got it! ,[SpongeBob chews gum and spits it on the bottom of the tables], Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?
,Squidward:, Lower!
,SpongeBob:, Initiating stage two: collateral damage! ,[he throws a brick at the window, but it is thick glass and it bounces off and hits him in the face, then, he walks up to Squidward, his clothes tattered, him scuffed up with mangled hat, twisted eyelashes and a black eye], How was that?
,Squidward:, Perfect!
,SpongeBob:, Ehh...
,[gives a thumbs up and smiles, showing his damaged teeth, one dangling from only a string of his gums],
,Harold:, This place is disgusting!
,Fred:, Yeah, let's get out of here, just as soon as I finish this delicious Krabby Patty!
,[SpongeBob grabs Squidward by the shirt and points to the customers, about to exit],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, all the customers are leaving!
,Squidward:, What did we talk about?
,SpongeBob:, Don't touch the material.
,[lets go of the shirt],
,Squidward:, If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, can do, Squidward, can do!
,Harold:, Come on, let's go.
,SpongeBob:, Wait! You don't want to miss... This!
,[he shrugs his shoulders up and flares his hands outwards while jumping and crossing his legs],
,Debbie:, What's he doing?
,Harold:, He's... dancing! ,[he grabs his head by the sides, stands on his tippy-toes and moves his midsection in and out], Okay, people, just back away slowly... ,[he turns around, thrusts his rear out and kicks back a leg, one at a time, while making funny noises, and everyone backs away, creeped out],
,[meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is on his way back to the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make you feel like a man! ,[he laughs at his own reflection in them], Let's see how SpongeBob's doing as acting manager. ,[he goes in through the door and is shocked at what he finds], What the...?! SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?
,[back view of SpongeBob leaning forward and swinging his arms],
,SpongeBob:, And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho! And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho...
,Mr. Krabs:, Me customers cowering in fear?
,[all the customers are huddled in the far back corner of the building],
,Evelyn:, Help... us...
,Mr. Krabs:, The Krusty Krab’s a filthy mess?
,[Frank holds a tray of food with a Krusty Krab hat],
,Frank:, Order number 20 ready for pickup.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[anger rising], And some stranger cooking Krabby Patties?! ,[Squidward is asleep in the ordering boat], Squidward sleeping on the job?! Okay, that's actually normal. SpongeBob! What have ye done to me Krusty Krab!
,SpongeBob:, I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs. He told me all your secrets!
,Mr. Krabs:, All my secrets...? ,[stares at his newly-polished nails and then nervously hides them behind his back, sweating and chuckles nervously], So, is there anything else I can do for you, acting manager SpongeBob? ,[cut to Mr. Krabs doing the dishes, he chips a nail again], Ah, Gwenevere!
,[pan across the restaurant to show that random fish cooking, Squidward asleep, overturned gummy tables with mud everywhere, and SpongeBob dancing in front of fearful customers to Russian music],

"[inside Mr. Krabs house],
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪Me dollar lies over the ocean, me dollar lies over--♪ ,[sniffing, then exhales. His breath is revealed, which smells like a port. His breath contains a lighthouse and some seagulls. sniffs again], Whoa! Blarney stone, that's a horrible reek. I knew I was forgetting somethin'. ,[grabs a toothbrush with toothpaste, and sings again], Ohhhhhhh, bring back me money to me! ,[starts brushing his teeth. A rumble is heard, and one of Pearl's fins breaks through the mirror. Mr. Krabs stops brushing],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's strange. I'm sure I can remember screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, but here it is on the edge of the sink, plain as day. Heh heh! These are strange times we're livin' in.
,Pearl:, Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, That sounded like me beloved teenage daughter, Pearl. I'm coming, princess!
,Pearl:, ,[groaning],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pearl! What in the name of Neptune's Aunt Nancy is with all this ruckus?
,[Pearl's legs suddenly starts growing, along with her head, her body, her ponytail, and her fins],
,Pearl:, What's happening to me?! ,[her mouth grows. Now her weight breaks the bed],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pearl, this is terrible! I paid 30 bucks for that bed! 'Course, that was when you were a newborn. Maybe if I crunched a few numbers and checked the warranty, I could—
,Pearl:, I ,[pants], need ,[pants], food. ,[continues panting],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[brings refrigerator], Okay, Pearl! I wasn't sure what to get, so I just brought the whole--
,[Pearl's tongue grabs the refrigerator, puts in her mouth, and chews],
,Mr. Krabs:, ...refrigerator.
,[Pearl starts to grow some more],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pearl, I somehow just realized what's happening.
,Pearl:, So did I.
,Mr. Krabs:, You're havin' one of them, uh, you know, one of them, um, growth spouts. It means you're healthy.
,Pearl:, It means I need food!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[opens cabinet], Empty! ,[actually, there are 2 foods available],
,Old cracker:, What am I, chopped liver?
,Chopped liver:, No, that's what I am. ,[rimshot],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[panting],
,Pearl:, Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Darling, I searched the entire house. There's not a speck of food to be spoken of.
,Pearl:, Well, you're just gonna have to go buy some.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[panics], Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat.
,Pearl:, Wait, what's that green stuff in your pocket?
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh? Where?
,Pearl:, There! ,[grabs money],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me money?
,Pearl:, I'll just have to eat this.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, wait! I'll think of something. ,[walks out of his house], Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh? ,[sees a fence. He peeks in someone's garden and sees a peanut garden. He gets a basket and grabs all the peanut worms. Inside the house, Mrs. Puff is seen snoring],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[snores], Must protect garden. ,[snores], Only thing that makes life worth living.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hehehehehe! Peanuts! ,[peanuts wiggle], What the... ,[peanuts pop out their eyes and squirt Mr. Krabs], These peanut worms are pets, not vegetables! ,[screams and leaves the basket behind],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[opens door suddenly], Who's there? I'm warning you. I have a blunt instrument here, and I'm not afraid to use it. ,[She sees Mr. Krabs stuck in the fence, trying to escape], There you are, sucker! ,[throws her crowbar and hits the fence, causing the fence to flip and hit the back of Mr. Krabs. Acting as a boomerang, the crowbar flies back to Mrs. Puff],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[still running], Cucumbers. Squirting me. Flying stuff! ,[laughing hysterically. He hides in a big rock, only to be revealed that it's Patrick's house. He sees a refrigerator filled with food], Jackpot. ,[sees Patrick, sleeping with his head on a bowl of Kelpo], Surely Patrick could spare a few morsels. After all, it's for a worthy cause. Me beloved Pearl. ,[grabs all the food], Don't worry, Pearl, Daddy found you some vittles! ,[the food is actually sand], Bottom feeders. ,[He sees Patrick and gets the bowl of Kelpo. He runs back to his daughter, exhausted], Pearl! I brought you some-- ,[Pearl grabs the cereal], ...cereal.
,Pearl:, More, Daddy, More!
,[cut to Mrs. Puff's house],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[petting a peanut worm], There, there, my darling, the bad man is gone now. And if he comes back, we'll make sure he never walks again!
,[two police officers appear],
,Officer:, Which way did you say the kidnapper ran, Miss, uh, Mrs., uh, Ms., Mrs., Miss, Mrs. ,[clears throat], So which way did you say he went?
,Mrs. Puff:, I said he went that way.
,Officer:, ,[writes on his notepad for about five seconds], Anything else?
,Mrs. Puff:, No.
,Officer:, ,[writes on his notepad for about five seconds, then taps notepad], Got it. Johnson. ,[Officer Johnson turns on the flashlight and points it at the fence], Well, looks like whoever it was is gone now, ma'am. Enjoy the rest of the evening. ,[both walk to their to their police boat], I tell ya, these calls are getting more and more weird. I mean, what kind of nutcase would want to break into someone's vegetable garden at this time of night?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food! ,[passes the police boat],
,Officer:, Well, I doubt he's gonna turn up anywhere near here again tonight. What do you say we go check out that new 24-hour taser emporium you were talking about? ,[drives out],
,Mr. Krabs:, Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! ,[passes Squidward's house, then doubles back and sniffs], Food. ,[uses nose to try to unlock the door. Mr. Krabs sees Squidward sleeping in the bedroom], Not food. ,[stops and smells the flowers, then continues. He then turns on the light and gasps], Hanging cured meats. Exotic spices. A breadbox overflowing with baguettes. Yummy stuff everywhere! I'll start with the fridge. ,[opens fridge filled with food], Candied sea yams, pickled urchins, anemone pies, a bucket of kelp slaw.... Et cetera. Ooh, more et cetera. ,[walks out of the house],
,Squidward's house:, Oh, well. I needed to lose a little weight anyway.
,Officer:, ,[talking to Johnson], And that's what I told him. I said, ""If you're not gonna bring an extra set of batteries, then why even carry a--"" ,[sees Mr. Krabs carrying a sack filled with food], Hey mister! What's with the sack?
,Mr. Krabs:, S-sack?
,Officer:, Yeah, sack. That big giant sack thing you're carrying on your back, that sack.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's, uh... I'm, uh, practicing to be ""Santy Claws"" for the holidays.
,[siren on the boat wails. The police drop Mr. Krabs off to his house],
,Officer:, Okay, you have a safe night now.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks again, officer!
,Officer:, Be seeing you in a couple months. ,[chuckles], Happy Holidays.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, Pearly, I got some vittles for ya! ,[Pearl begs to put the food in her mouth. Mr. Krabs dumps all the food in her mouth. Her stomach growls that the scene shakes, then, she burps loudly],
,Pearl:, More!
,Mr. Krabs:, I was afraid you were gonna say that.
,[Mr. Krabs runs to get some food. He sees SpongeBob's house in front of him. Inside, SpongeBob turns on the kitchen light, where he sees Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, I wasn't stealing food!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice. See
,SpongeBob:, Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles nervously], G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect.
,Squidward:, Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.
,SpongeBob:, But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.
,Squidward:, I don't care. I'm calling the police. ,[dialing],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, wait, you can't.
,Squidward:, Oh? And why is that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Because if you do, I'll fire ya. ,[Squidward continues dialing], No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?
,Squidward:, Hello, police?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold it! I'll... I'll...
,Squidward:, You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?
,[Mr. Krabs sniffles, and yanks out his golden tooth. He gives it to Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, I didn't know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.
,Squidward:, Neither did I.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sobbing], Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl.
,SpongeBob:, Pearl? What happened?
,Mr. Krabs:, She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory.
,SpongeBob:, You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.
,[cut to the Krusty Krab],
,Pearl:, Oh, Oh! So hungry, not gonna make it!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, hurry it up!
,SpongeBob:, Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready.
,Mr. Krabs:, You've been saying that for the last-- ,[SpongeBob appears with the Krabby Patty.. The Krabby Patty is put in Pearl's mouth. She burps],
,Pearl:, Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing. I feel great. Heh, Heh!
,Mr. Krabs:, Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?
,SpongeBob:, It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs, then stops], Eh?

,SpongeBob:, Bikini Bottom pet show today! Good thing I put those notes there. Otherwise, I could've forgotten. And I wouldn't wanna do that because the Bikini Bottom pet show is where you gotta go to see the best pets in town. Not that any other pet can take a chance against my buddy Gary. He's the bestest pet in the whole world. Love you, Gare-Gare. ,[Watch rings], Oh! The show starts in an hour! Hey, Gare, time to... Gary? Ow! Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary?
,Perch Perkins:, Looks like another beautiful day here in Bikini Bottom. It... Huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks onto set where the Perch is doing his newscast from], Gary? ,[gasps from coming out of Squidward's bathtub], Gary? Oh, hi ya, Squidward. ,[Squidward kicks him out of his house through the window and SpongeBob screams], Whoooooooaaaaaa! Ohhhhhhhh! Gary? Gary? Gary? ,[SpongeBob walks back and finds Gary hiding in the bookshelf], Gary, there you are. ,[pulls Gary off], What are you doing here? Well, today is the day you show everyone else you're the best pet in the whole world. Now, for a quick checklist. Let's see, eye reflects. Check. Slime viscosity. ,[SpongeBob drags Gary's slime around his house, then, Squidward's house], Hi, Squidward. ,[Continues], Ready! Hi again, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Yello.
,SpongeBob:, Check. And last, but not least, a quick undercarriage check. ,[Gary hisses], Whoa, okay, maybe we should skip that one. Let's see... Yep, that's about does it. A second, buddy. I'll carry your shell. ,[Dogs bark],
,Fish #1:, Stand up straight. Posture is everything in appearance.
,Fish #2:, Roll over.
,Fish #3:, Your newly trimmed hairstyles highlight your regality.
,SpongeBob:, Huh, people sure seem to treat their pets differently here.
,Charles:, That's a good boy, Foofie. Look at your luxurious mane. Every self-respecting snail has one.
,SpongeBob:, Luxurious mane?
,Foofie:, Meow.
,Charles:, Oh, yes. How could I forget? Accessories! Your diamond-studded leash?
,SpongeBob:, I always use an old rope. I guess that's not good enough.
,Charles:, Of course, there's the cherry on the beauty cake: the glossy painted shell! And last, but not least, well maintained oral hygiene. Just look at your pearly whites!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Gary?
,Gary:, Meeeoooowwwwwwwww. ,[Gary opens his mouth and shows his rotten teeth],
,Charles:, Anyway, we best run along, Foofs. Your pedicure is in half an hour.
,SpongeBob:, Pedicure? I didn't realize how much went into this.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't be so protective of me, Gary. I know I've been an horrible parent. But no longer! From this moment on forth, I vow to give my Gary the utmost in empty frivolity! To live by the standards of snail grooming, set forth by: that guy!
,Patrick:, What's up?
,SpongeBob:, No, not you.
,Patrick:, Okay.
,SpongeBob:, Enough dilly-dallying! We got to get down to business!
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Hold still, Gary. Uhhhhhh! Come on, buddy! ,[Gary hisses and meows], Uhh! Uhh! There. Oh, you're like a little cuddly present. ,[laughs],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, And the piece de resistance: glow-in-the-dark paint. Hey, where are you going? Gary, wait. We got to go back to the pet show!
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, Because we have got to show those other pets we are just as fancy as they are. ,[Gary's tongue spits], Oh, come on, Gary. Don't be this way. I'm doing it for you, not me.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, That's what I like to hear because I can bring this out. Your very own studded collar. With two rows of diamonds. Here, try it on. Now, let's get back out there and knock them out of their shells.
,Gary:, Meow.
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm so glad you just happened to show up. Help me. ,[Whispers. Gary tries to get away, but they both grab him and put him into a bathtub. Patrick opens Gary's mouth so SpongeBob can brush his teeth], Gary, stop it! I'm only doing this because I love you. ,[cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are walking Gary down the street], Gary, look, it's him. 
,Charles:, Come, now, Foof. Put your tail up, up, up.
,SpongeBob:, Hello! Sorry to bother you. Just wanted to get your opinion on my snail, Gary.
,Charles:, ,[laughs], My boy, don't seem to get it, do you? There's only one way to prove your pet's beauty. By winning the pet contest. But I wouldn't bother, seeing as how Foofie and I have won in the past five years! ,[laughs], Oh, well, enough mingling with the common folk. Let's go win our medal, Foof. ,[Opens his umbrella as he and Foofie fly over to the pet show],
,SpongeBob:, This is it, Gary. This is our time to shine! ,[He, Gary and Patrick go into the pet show], Wow, Patrick. There's a whole lot of pet loving going on here today.
,Patrick:, Yeah. You and Gary don't have a chance.
,Store owner:, Excuse me, sir, but all non-pet owners must remain behind this rope.
,Patrick:, Now, what am I gonna do? I'm all alone behind this rope!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm right here.
,Patrick:, You don't understand, SpongeBob! You'll never understand what it's like to be alone behind the red rope! ,[starts crying and runs away],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Gary. He'll be back in time to see us win first place. Now, let's go scope out the competition.
,Fish #5:, There it is, Mrs. Squiggles. Your new hairdo.
,Fish #6:, There you go, Muffsies. Oh, isn't that cute.
,Muffsies:, Meeeeoooowww!
,Fish #6:, ,[gasps], Poor Muffsies, your shades slipped right off your little eyes? Lucky I brought an extra smaller pair. Uhhhhhhhh! ,[Puts it on Muffsies' eyes],
,Muffsies:, ,[Growling],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm... Maybe you needs some shades, eh, Gare? ,[Sees Gary eating his leash], Silly boy, you're not supposed to eat the leash.
,Gary:, Meow!
,SpongeBob:, Come on, buddy.
,Fish #7:, Now, let's try this cape.
,Kenney:, ,[sighs],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, these pets are gussied today. Maybe I need a top hat or something to class it up a bit. Gary? Oh, thanks for reminding me. I didn't know your collar was loose. ,[Gary coughs], Now, let's go get that top hat, buddy. Uhhhhhhhhhh! There you go.
,Gary:, Meow.
,Judge:, All right, let's see. ,[examines each snail], Uh-huh. Decent Stalk Length. Oh, good hinge action. Ah, Foofie. Excellent bow stretch. Well-defined eyelid capillaries. Foofie is looking as good as ever, Charles.
,Charles:, Oh, why, thank you, sir.
,Judge:, ,[moves onto Gary], Okay, let's have a look-see, shall we? Ah, yes, good spacing on the larynx. Nice gastric chamber. All within breed description.
,SpongeBob:, It's in the bag!
,Judge:, Now, if we can just check the undercarriage. ,[Gary screeches and bites the judge],
,Gary:, Meoooooowwwwwww! ,[everyone gasps],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, no! Gary, you spit him out right now! ,[takes Gary off of the judge’s head as he slithers goes over to the podium. To the judge], I'm sorry. He usually only bites me.

,Charles:, Foofie, what have you done?
,Foofie:, Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
,Charles:, What's this about? Does anyone speak snail?
,SpongeBob:, I speak a little bit, sir. I know what they're saying. They're saying: Owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners. Please, please, please, please please, please, please don't be this way. They're saying they don't want this type of pampering. They want to be treated as companions, not dress-up dolls. They don't want scratchy outfits, they want to be scratched! They are protesting the indignity of wigs and jewel-encrusted collars and they want to be free from superficial and degrading pageants, like these.
,Pets:, Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
,SpongeBob:, You were trying to tell me that all along, weren't you, Gary?
,Gary:, Meow, meow!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I won't let it happen again.
,Judge:, Well, I think we can all agree that this year’s groomers cup goes to... SpongeBob and his wonderful pet!
,SpongeBob:, Did you hear that, Gary? They're rewarding you for standing up and speaking out against injustice. Maybe these pageants aren't so superficial after all.
,Judge:, What are you talking about? The snail didn't win, I was referring to your other pet. He's so adorable.

,Patrick:, Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks. ,[hits a rock and flies and screams then bashes his body on mountain just like on his game],
,Sandy:, See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.
,SpongeBob:, I'm listening to you, mountain! ,[starts sandboarding, and he passes by Patrick's legs], Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah, I forgot. ,[eats yellow sand on a plate],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Sandy, watch me do the ""Grouchy Squidward"".
,Squidward:, ,[sits at a table drinking tea close to the mountain], Stop naming moves after me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[imitating Squidward], Everybody's an idiot except for me.
,Squidward:, Well, it's true. ,[takes a sip],
,[SpongeBob laughs like Squidward, Sandy and Patrick laugh with him],
,Sandy:, ,[stops laughing and gasps], SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!

Someone turned the mountain upside down! ,[camera reveals that SpongeBob is upside down and not the mountain and he screams as he falls],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!
,SpongeBob:, ,[makes himself right-side up and he takes off his pants], Like this?
,Patrick:, No, your other bottom!
,Sandy:, Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?
,Patrick:, Not until 4.
,[SpongeBob crashes into the ground and his bottom breaks into tiny pieces],
,Sandy:, Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
,Patrick:, Do it again! I wasn't looking!
,[Cuts to the doctor's office],
,Doctor:, Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.
,SpongeBob:, My what has a what now?
,Doctor:, Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing. ,[he turns an x-ray on], It took twenty hours to put it all back together. ,[he holds a stapler], We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick ,[he holds a glue stick],. Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there. ,[points to where the fish is], ,[we see Tom and his butt is in a giant machine], In the Iron Butt.
,Tom:, ,[in the Iron Butt], Aww, man. It itches.
,SpongeBob:, ,[outside hospital], You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol. ,[sees Harold behind him], Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!
,Harold:, What's your problem? ,[leaves SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Whew. That was close.
,Football Player:, Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player. ,[another football player catches a football], Nice catch, Percy! ,[slaps Percy's bottom, SpongeBob cringes as he holds his butt],
,Jimmy:, Hey, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob screams as he turns around, while holding his butt], You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine! ,[crawls between people's legs, who each take turns spanking his butt], Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.
,Martin:, Next. 
,SpongeBob:, No. ,[screams as he runs off. Everybody looks at him],

,Sandy:, Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy! ,[Patrick starts laughing as they enter SpongeBob's house], Hey, SpongeBob!

,Sandy:, ,[Patrick smiles again], Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob?

,SpongeBob:, ,[with a little smile on his face], Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world? 
,Sandy:, Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that? 
,SpongeBob:, Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again. 
,Sandy:, That's crazy talk! 
,Patrick:, That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk. ,[does various forms of gibberish blabbing, but his third blabbing makes his saliva hit Sandy, making her hammer-fist him to shut him up, bashing his head in], Sorry. 
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead. 
,Patrick:, Or your other armpit! 
,SpongeBob:, I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary. 
,Sandy:, Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome? 
,SpongeBob:, I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny... ,[holds up a penny], and Chip... ,[holds up a potato chip], and say hello to Used Napkin. ,[holds up a used napkin], 
,Sandy:, Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab? 
,SpongeBob:, No problem! ,[he grabs the end of a spatula, which is so long it stretches all the way inside the Krusty Krab], A ,really, long spatula. ,[flips a patty with the really long spatula], 
,Sandy:, What about eating? 
,SpongeBob:, I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed. ,[breathes in a different and weird way], 
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside! 
,SpongeBob:, Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again. 
,Patrick:, Never ever? 
,SpongeBob:, Never ever ever!

,Squidward:, ,[pops out of his window], No! ,[slams his window shut], 
,Patrick:, Aww! 
,Sandy:, Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of. 
,Patrick:, And that's when I ,[holds a boxing glove], punch him, right? ,[Sandy gives a bummed look. Patrick and Sandy are jellyfishing outside SpongeBob's house], 
,Sandy:, Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun. 
,Patrick:, ,[catches a jellyfish], I caught one! ,[puts head in net and his jellyfish sticks to his face], Huh? 
,SpongeBob:, ,[Patrick gets electrocuted in the background, making him scream in pain], Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting. ,[puts on a pair of glasses and a tiny net and waves it in the air], I think I caught one! 
,Sandy:, We've got to try something else! 
,[Patrick and Sandy are holding a cake in front of SpongeBob's house], 
,Sandy and Patrick:, ♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!♪ 
,Sandy:, Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish. 
,SpongeBob:, I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny! ,[the penny lies silently on the floor], 
,Patrick:, ,[sniffles], That penny has the most beautiful voice. 
,Sandy:, ,[goes inside the window to angrily point at a smiling SpongeBob], That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside! ,[goes outside],

,Sandy:, Patrick, that's not fun. 
,Old man:, It is for me!

,Sandy:, Nothing's working, Patrick! 
,Patrick:, What do we do? 
,Old man:, ,[appearing from below], I say we take a bath! 
,Sandy:, Wha...will you get out of here? 
,[Patrick and Sandy are hiding behind a coral bush and Patrick is in a gorilla suit], 
,Sandy:, Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal. 
,Patrick:, Right. ,[he zips up his mask], 
,Sandy:, ,[opens the door], All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat! ,[Patrick comes out in the gorilla suit and acts crazy like a gorilla], Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob! 
,SpongeBob:, Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year. 
,Sandy:, ,[Patrick continues dancing], No, really! You've got to come and save me! ,[Suddenly, a second Patrick shows up out of nowhere with an ice cream], 
,Patrick #2:, Hey, Sandy, ,[SpongeBob gives a startled look], who's your friend?
,Sandy:, ,[Confused], But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.
,Patrick #1:, I am in the gorilla suit. ,[unzips the gorilla suit], I thought I was doing a pretty good job.
,Sandy:, If you're Patrick, then who's that? ,[The two look at second Patrick who unzips his head, which reveals a real gorilla underneath which scares them!], Ah! A real gorilla!
,SpongeBob:, '[Shocked], Huh?! ,[The gorilla rips out of the Patrick suit it is wearing. Sandy and Patrick are screaming. The gorilla grabs the scared Patrick and Sandy, puts them in a bag, and repeatedly beats them], Oh, my gosh! ,[Sandy and Patrick are still screaming while the gorilla beats them], This can't be happening! ,[The gorilla hits Patrick and Sandy using a chair, then beating them some more], This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about! ,[the gorilla can be seen still beating up the sack outside the window; it also does things like dribbling the sack and bouncing on it like it's a ball], Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.,
,Gary:, ,[eats Chip, killing him], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks behind], Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world. ,[gulps and shakes as he reaches for the door. The door shakes as well until SpongeBob opens it], I'm taking my ,[walks slowly], first step. ,[continues walking], So far, so good. I think I can do this! ,[the wind blows a piece of paper onto his face; SpongeBob screams], Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me! ,[Squidward waters his plants and rolls his eyes and SpongeBob removes the paper off his face], I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now! ,[the gorilla grabs SpongeBob], Is it too late to go back inside again? ,[the gorilla rips SpongeBob in half],
,1st half of SpongeBob:, It's too late. ,[the gorilla screeches], Patrick? Sandy?
,Patrick and Sandy:, ,[still in the bag], Yes, SpongeBob?
,1st half of SpongeBob:, I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.
,Sandy:, ,[shaken], Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.
,First half of SpongeBob:, You know what I don't understand though? ,[moves to the second half of SpongeBob],
,Second half of SpongeBob:, What?
,First half of SpongeBob:, What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place? ,[the gorilla's eyes widen],
,Gorilla:, ,[man's voice], Oh! Well, it's funny you should, uh, you see, George, they're on to us! ,[A zebra rushes onto the screen],
,George:, Let's get outta here! ,[the gorilla gets on George and rides away with him. Patrick, Sandy, and the two halves of SpongeBob are watching the gorilla ride on George into the sunset.

"[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house during the night. As SpongeBob and Gary are asleep, a worm appears at the window.

,SpongeBob:, Hi. ,[looks up], Gary, I feel funny inside.
,[Gary is still sleeping. SpongeBob digs his finger into one of his holes. The worm bites his finger.],

,[The worm pops out.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hello.

,SpongeBob:, Nighty-night, Prickles.
,[SpongeBob and Gary go back to sleep. But as they sleep, Prickles wakes up and signals an airplane inside SpongeBob's house. The airplane drops off more worms and the worms parachute inside SpongeBob's body.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,[SpongeBob wakes up and sees Prickles and his worm friends disco dancing inside his body. Two worms are flashing lights with the music, the other two worms are blowing through their noisemakers, another is juggling fire clubs, and a clown worm is riding through the holes on a bicycle. As they continue to party, SpongeBob bounces along with the music.],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, a house party going on inside of me! Hey, why wasn't I invited? ,[laughs], I guess I was since I am the house! Look, Gary, now we have tons of prickly new friends! ,[shows Gary the worms],
,Gary:, ,[annoyed], Meow, meow.
,SpongeBob:, Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
,French Narrator:, 3,000 Wup-poos later...
,SpongeBob:, Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! ,[babbling and humming],
,[Gary slithers to the window and pulls the shades up. It is morning outside.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, my gosh! I completely lost all track of time! Hey, uh, sorry to be a party pooper, guys, but I've gotta take a shower and get ready for work.
,[But the worms are too distracted by the music and continue to dance.],
,SpongeBob:, Guys? Guy—guys?
,[Gary growls at the worms and pushes SpongeBob with his eyestalks.],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, calm down. We're all friends here.
,[One worm blows a raspberry at Gary. Gary has had enough with the worms and pushes SpongeBob out of his house.],
,SpongeBob:, Ow! ,[gasps and pulls his underwear up], Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!
,[Gary throws out a pair of pants.],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, I need to take a shower.
,[Gary throws out a stick of ""Stinky Pits"" deodorant. SpongeBob rubs his armpits with the deodorant. Nearby, a mother and a child are watching what SpongeBob is doing.],
,Debbie Rechid:, I did not need to see that! Ugh!
,[The mom jumps into the baby carriage and drives off. SpongeBob throws away the deodorant stick and puts his pants on.],
,SpongeBob:, All right, I guess you guys will just have to stay and go to work with me. Just keep a low profile or I could lose my job.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob flipping patties at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, SpongeBob. Did ya clean out the— ,[gasps as he sees the worms in SpongeBob's body], Sweet Dutchman's ghost! ,[rubs his finger against SpongeBob's body], When's the last time you took a bath, boy-o? You're riddled with vermin.
,SpongeBob:, I—I d—d—don't know what you mean, sir.
,[SpongeBob inhales his worms into his body, but he runs out of breath and the worms fly out.],
,Mr. Krabs:, If customers find out you're touching patties with your wormy hands, the health department will shut us down for sure.
,[SpongeBob's hands are covered with worms.],
,SpongeBob:, I understand, sir. Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me for a second? ,[whispering], Prickles, you heard my boss. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave, please.
,[Prickles goes inside SpongeBob's head and types out on a piece of paper.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reads paper], ""Squatters rights?"" What the heck is squatters rights?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[takes paper and reads it], Oh, they're ""lawyering"" up, boy-o. They're makin' a legal claim to keep living in your body.
,SpongeBob:, It's okay, Mr. Krabs, they're not hurting me.
,Mr. Krabs:, Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy ""condisherin'.""
,[Prickles pops out and dumps garbage on the patties.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[irritated], Oh! That's the last straw! Mr. Squid—
,Squidward:, On it, sir! Hasta la vista, worm boy!
,[Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the restaurant with a broom. But as he pushes him out, the broom is now a really long pole hand-made by Squidward himself.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And don't come back until you're dewormed!
,SpongeBob:, What am I gonna do?
,[SpongeBob tries to push some worms out of his body as Plankton walks by.],
,Plankton:, Hey, SpongeBo— Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, and I lost my job over it.
,Plankton:, Lost your job you say? I might be able to help you, if you can do something for me.
,SpongeBob:, Anything, Plankton! Anything!
,[Plankton puts on rubber gloves and grabs a tank of toxic gas for pests.],
,Plankton:, ,[chuckles], Ridding SpongeBob of his worms will put him forever in my debt. That secret formula is good as mine!
,[SpongeBob picks Plankton up so he can enter his body and exterminate the worms.],
,Plankton:, Time to crash this lousy party. Get it? Lousy? Louse? Oh, I'm good.
,[Plankton roars as he attempts to get rid of the worms. But the worms attack Plankton from left to right inside SpongeBob's body until they push him out. Plankton is now injured from his fight with the worms.],
,Plankton:, ,[groans], You're on your own, worm boy.
,[SpongeBob is overwhelmed at his condition as the worms continue to party inside.],
,French Narrator:, Soon after...
,[SpongeBob continues to fight off the worms as he runs over to Patrick's house. He knocks on the rock as the worms continue partying in his body. Patrick opens up.],
,Patrick:, Hello?
,SpongeBob:, You gotta help me!
,[The worms cover around SpongeBob's eyes and mouth to make a scary face.],
,Patrick:, Ah! It's a monster with SpongeBob's voice!
,SpongeBob:, No, no, Patrick, wait, don't close the—
,[Patrick shuts his rock.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw! Hmm?
,[SpongeBob sees Squidward entering his house and attempts to walk over to him.],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! ,[his eyes and mouth are covered with worms], I need a hug!
,[Squidward screams, takes out a hose, and sprays SpongeBob with water. SpongeBob's body becomes filled with water. A worm swims inside SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Does that mean no hug?
,Squidward:, There will be no hugs! Get away from me, you monstrosity!
,[The worms jump out of SpongeBob and swim over to attack Squidward. Squidward screams and runs into his house. The worms go back inside SpongeBob as he sulks his way to his house, which is boarded up by Gary. Gary growls as SpongeBob walks until he stops. He turns around and his body has become an apartment. One of the worms is seen hanging her laundry on her clothesline. SpongeBob opens his body and sees various worms doing their daily activities. One elderly worm is watching television, two worms are hanging out at a jacuzzi, another worm is rap dancing, and one cranky worm is knocking on the ceiling with a broomstick. SpongeBob closes his body as he has completely lost his sanity.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, this is my life from now on, huh? ,[laughs], Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms. ,[laughing],
,[As SpongeBob loses his sanity while laughing uncontrollably, the worms become annoyed by his constant laughter as he is shaking his body. The worms have had enough with his laughter and decide to leave his body once and for all. They gather up all of their stuff, load up their mini van, and exit SpongeBob's body.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Oh, that's better. Looks like I really wormed my way out of that one. ,[laughs as Gary slithers up to him],
,Gary:, ,[sniffs], Meow!
,[SpongeBob hugs Gary.],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, it feels so good to be worm free!
,[SpongeBob carries Gary into his house. The worms that left SpongeBob's body enter Squidward's house and begin partying inside.],
,Squidward:, ,[screams], SpongeBob! I need a hug! ,[The short "",Clam Up!,"" plays],

"[The episode opens with the outside of SpongeBob's house, cut to the inside of the pineapple and we see SpongeBob sleeping, his foghorn alarm clock goes off, SpongeBob and Gary wake up.],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Good morning to you, too, Gary. Help yourself to some breakfast kibble while I make ready for my day at the Krusty Krab. ,[gets out of bed while Gary just looks at him, SpongeBob takes off his pajama hat and places it on the coat rack, we see Gary standing in his path],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Finished your breakfast already, Gare? You always were a good little eater. ,[bursts open the kitchen door dressed],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, We can play fetch when I get home, Gary. Right now Mr. Krabs needs me. There's leftovers in the fridge if you get... ,[is about to walk outside and opens the door to find Gary stuck to the outside],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,Ah!, Gary, what has gotten into you? Is there something important that you'd like to tell me? ,[Gary holds up a calendar showing that it's Sunday the 26nd. He points to it], Ah! Today is Sunday?! But that means...
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today. ,[takes off his hat] ,The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays. ,[gets back in bed] ,Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have?, [phone rings], Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick... You... need... a house-sitter?! Today?!
,Sandy:, That's right, SpongeBob. I know it's last minute, but...
,SpongeBob:, ,[at her house, still on the phone, not wearing his helmet], I would love to. ,[Sandy looks at her phone puzzled. Scene cuts to Sandy's treedome],
,Sandy:, Okay, SpongeBob, my treedome is a highly technical facility and there are many facets to its operation. ,[SpongeBob is staring at her] ,SpongeBob, are you getting all this?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,Sandy:, Here's a comprehensive list of ""do""s and ""don't""s to follow. ,[gives SpongeBob the list],
,SpongeBob:, Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge.
,Sandy:, ,[chuckles] ,That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope. ,[holds up the reading scope. SpongeBob takes it from her. He looks through it and sees the list clearer with lots of don't's],
,SpongeBob:, Oh.
,Sandy:, Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do...
,SpongeBob:, Wow...!
,Sandy:, ...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal., [SpongeBob takes down notes],
,SpongeBob:, Nor... mal."" Got it. ,[he and Sandy are at a garage door opening] ,
,Sandy:, And this is the robot warehouse. It's where I keep all my robots.
,SpongeBob:, That stands to reason.
,Sandy:, This part's easy. All's you gotta do is come in here and count every single one of these robots and make sure none of them's gone missing. ,[SpongeBob takes down notes again. Scene cuts to him and Sandy walking] ,You seem to be doing a good job paying attention, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, I respect your meticulous nature.
,Sandy:, ,[blushes] ,Oh! Why, thank you, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[concerned], What's next on the list?
,Sandy:, This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway. ,[SpongeBob takes down notes again. Scene cuts to him and Sandy at a shelf] ,And last but not least is my collection of rare and fragile artifacts that has to be cleaned twice daily. Now are you sure you can handle all that, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands.
,Sandy:, Are you sure?
,SpongeBob:, Yep.
,Sandy:, Are you ,really ,sure?
,SpongeBob:, Really sure.
,Sandy:, Okay. ,[Scene cuts to her going on her bus to Texas. The bus drives away. SpongeBob looks at the list and goes into the kelp greenhouse. He closes the door. He checks the temperature],
,SpongeBob:, ,[taking down notes], Normal. ,[he then goes in the robot warehouse. He is counting the robots], 2,692... ,[He is wearing a hat. He types the something down on a gadget. The gadget takes out some paper with the words on it], 2,693... ,[types something again and the gadget takes out more paper], 2,694... ,[types something again but he types to much causing the gadget to take out lots of paper. He starts laughing. Suddenly, the gadget goes on fire and so does the paper then it disintegrates. SpongeBob leaves. Scene cuts to him wearing a dress while dusting Sandy's artifacts], Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute. ,[turns a skull head around and spots a dot on it], Aha! ,[takes a feather off the duster and dusts the dot off], There... we go. ,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob checking the worm incubator], Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here. ,[there is a squishing sound], What the...? ,[a worm starts to hatch], Ohhh! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for... ,[checks the list], ...weeks! What is going on?! ,[Patrick's head pops up], Oh! Patrick? ,[Patrick pops out of the hole wearing his helmet],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! There you are!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks.
,Patrick:, Nah, no thanks. I had a late breakfast.
,SpongeBob:, Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?
,Patrick:, Well, because we can't breathe in Sandy's treedome, remember? It's filled with air.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for..., [dries up and starts gasping for water], P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe! ,[Patrick puts a water helmet on SpongeBob's head],
,Patrick:, There you go. ,[SpongeBob inhales and exhales],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick, ,[opens the door], I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome.
,Patrick:, E-Exit the... Exit the treedome?!
,SpongeBob:, That's right. Exit the tree...
,Patrick:, Oh, SpongeBob, that's a great idea! Where should we go—Jellyfish Fields, Goo Lagoon, Barg'N-Mart, Lucky Larry's?
,SpongeBob:, Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun.
,Patrick:, All right, let's go!
,SpongeBob:, Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility.
,Patrick:, Well, in that case, I'd better stay and help you.
,SpongeBob:, Nnnnope.
,Patrick:, Pleeease?
,SpongeBob:, Not gonna happen.
,Patrick:, Pretty please?
,SpongeBob:, No way.
,Patrick:, Pretty please with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?
,SpongeBob:, ,[scoffs], Yeah, right.
,Patrick:, Pretty please with a scoop of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, smothered in gooberberry sauce and topped with half a can of whipped topping?

,Patrick:, ,[raises his left hand], I, Patrick Star, hereby promise not to touch anything.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Now, let's check the list to see what's nex... ,[alarmed], Patrick! ,[Patrick is chomping on Sandy's artifact shelf. SpongeBob runs over to him] , Patrick, ,no!, You promised me you weren't gonna touch anything!
,Patrick:, ,[puts his water helmet back on], I wasn't touching anything!
, ,SpongeBob:, Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!
,Patrick:, Um... Tasting it.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, I insist. From now on, you must stick to me as closely as possible. Do I make myself perfectly clear? ,[Patrick doesn't answer], Patrick, I said, do I make myself perf... Patrick! Patrick? ,[turns to see Patrick sitting on his back],
,Patrick:, Is this close enough?
,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick under Sandy's tree],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, tell me again what it is you're gonna do.
,Patrick:, Not... touch anything.
,SpongeBob:, Mm-hmm. What else?
,Patrick:, Not do anything.
,SpongeBob:, And...?

,Patrick:, Hey, buddy, it's not as bad as it seems.
,SpongeBob:, Oh yeah, what makes you say that?
,Patrick:, Well, not everything is broken.
,SpongeBob:, ,[cries until Sandy came back and gasps], Sa..S...S..San....Sandy! ,[Sandy walks in shocked by the destruction], How was the inventors convention?
,Patrick:, Did you bring back any souvenirs?
,Sandy:, Funny, y'all should ask that.
,SpongeBob:, It is?
,Sandy:, Yep. I brought home something real handy.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[gasp],
,Sandy:, And I'm setting it to maximum power.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, this is it, our final goodbye.
,SpongeBob:, I never thought I go out like this.
,Patrick:, At a handsome squirrel?
,SpongeBob:, No, with a fishbowl on my head.
,[Sandy fires the laser and it restores her treedome just the way it was.],
,Sandy:, Eureka, it worked! The experiment is a success.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Experiment?
,Sandy:, That's right, boys. I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble. I could've just smashed all this stuff up myself, but nobody destroys stuff up quite like y'all. You're not a failure SpongeBob, you're a scientist! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh],
,Patrick:, Hooray!
,SpongeBob:, Hooray!
,[The flask in SpongeBob's hand drops and starts rolling towards the robot warehouse.],
,SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy:, Uh-oh! 
,[The robots from the warehouse become free again and robots start destroying the treedome again.],
,Patrick:, Wasn't me!
,Sandy:, Quit your worryin', y'all. I can fix it all with my handy dandy rubble reverse ray blaster.
,[Robot grabs the rubble reverse ray blaster out of Sandy's hand, smashes it, and leaves it on the ground.],
,Robot:, Ha, ha, ha!
,SpongeBob:, Silly old robot. He doesn't realize you have more than one of these ray guns. Isn't that right, Sandy? You do have more than one them? Don't you Sandy? ,[Sandy doesn't answer],  Sandy? ,[gulps],

He places some tea on the table in front of his couch, then gets a stack of cookies, then picks up the remote, then fluffs both of his pillows, then sits down and turns on the TV. A square and a triangle are moving around, Squidward sips his tea, then the shapes turn into a house. A bird flies on the house, and a sound bubble comes out of his mouth that says ""House Fancy"". A rainbow and a chimney appears on the house, then the scene opens like a door, revealing Nicholas Withers],

,Squilliam:, Hellooo!
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], This isn't Squilliam Fancyson, my life long rival who I met in high school band class, is it?
,Squilliam:, The same. You wouldn't happen to be watching House Fancy, would you?
,Squidward:, I was, until you called.
,Squilliam:, Well Squiddy, I enjoy our chat, but my catered lunch awaits. And you know how hard being fabulous is on an empty stomach! ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?
,Nick:, ,[heard through phone], Sorry Squilliam, but we've gotta get back to the show.
,Squidward:, Who's that talking in the background?
,Squilliam:, Oh I'm dreadfully sorry, Nicky dear. Well, toodle loo Squidward. ,[it is revealed that he is on the program], Enjoy the program.

Now I'll just... ,[screams again], There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect. ,[screams again, because there is a faded spot where the painting was], Oh no! ,[looks at the time], I'll never get this place in shape in time! ,[notices SpongeBob in the window, who quickly disappears.

,Squidward:, How'd you know about that?
,SpongeBob:, I was spying on you.
,Squidward:, Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because... ,[looks at the time again, then sighs], All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo? ,[SpongeBob is behind him],
,SpongeBob:, Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero! ,[Cuts to later],
,Squidward:, All right, first of all, I'm going to give you something so simple, that a person without a brain could even get it done right.
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's good, because I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend.
,Squidward:, Really?
,SpongeBob:, No, not really... He traded me these two chocolate bars for it.
,Squidward:, I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded spot on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[SpongeBob picks up the brush, then throws it away and absorbs the paint, then splatters the paint around],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what was that noise? ,[screams], Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room? I told you just to paint the faded spot.
,SpongeBob:, Well, it all looked kinda faded. ,[Squidward hisses, then looks at the clock again],
,Squidward:, Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa.
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?
,Squidward:, Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it until I say... ,[SpongeBob moves it on his foot], Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't... ,[SpongeBob moves it again], Ow!
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[moves it again, ripping off Squidward's toenail],
,Squidward:, Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say... ,[SpongeBob drops it on his foot], Ow! Why do you keep moving it?
,SpongeBob:, ‘Cause you keep saying “ow”! ,[Squidward screams, and lifts it up],
,Squidward:, I don't need you, I can move it myself. ,[slips on toenail, and trips],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Squidward, you're so strong! ,[there is a crash], And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now. ,[doorbell rings],
,Squidward:, Oh no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!
,SpongeBob:, Roger! ,[SpongeBob walks on screen with a vacuum], Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him.,[starts vacuuming], Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power. ,[SpongeBob struggles to flip the switch, and the switch breaks. The vacuum goes haywire, and vacuums up a rug, a plant, a sculpture of Squidward, then the sofa, then the book case, then everything else],
,Squidward:, Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the? ,[everything in Squidward's house is in the vacuum, which looks as if it's about to explode],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off. ,[SpongeBob tries to turn it off, but gets sucked in],
,Squidward:, Come out of there. ,[doorbell rings again], Uh, hang on please. ,[Squidward tries to push the bag, and the door bell rings again], Please, just one more minute Nick! ,[door opens, and it's Patrick],
,Patrick:, Who's Nick? Sorry, Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks. ,[Patrick runs into the bathroom. We hear him groan, then the toilet flushes, then he comes out], Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks. ,[He leaves the house. Squidward's toilet comes out of his bathroom groaning],
,Toilet:, Please, please, somebody put me out of my misery! ,[toilet jumps into Squidward's hands, coughing], Have mercy on my soul...! ,[toilet dies, then Patrick opens the door again],
,Patrick:, Oh, hey, Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it here. ,[Patrick puts his brain on the floor], See ya! ,[walks away, and the vacuum then sucks it up. SpongeBob is eating the chocolate bar],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, Patrick! ,[the vacuum says that it's on full capacity],
,Squidward:, Oh no! ,[Squidward's house explodes. Scene then cuts to the House Fancy background, then to Nick],
,Nick:, Hello, and welcome back to House Fancy. We're arriving at the home of Mr. Squidward Tentacles, who claims his house is far more fancier than that of Squilliam Fancyson. Let's take a look. ,[both are shocked because of Squidward's house], Well, I, I, I, well, I don't know how to say this...
,Squilliam:, Go ahead, say it.
,Nick:, Squidward Tentacles, you seem to have ushered in an entire new era in house fanciness!
,Squilliam:, Huh?
,Squidward:, I have-... I have?
,Nick:, What you have done here hearkens back to the illustrious post-primitive movement popularized by famous designer Saul Limpkins. Say, was he a big inspiration for you?
,Squidward:, Why, yes. I've studied him for... years! ,[Squilliam gulps],
,Nick:, I would like to announce, that Squidward's house will be featured in an hour long, commercial free House Fancy special, and Squidward will be crowned House Fancy prince, of the year! An honor which, was originally to be bestowed on Squilliam, but now isn't. ,[Squilliam falls],
,Squidward:, Yay! ,[Squilliam starts crying],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't worry, Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help redecorate your house. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed. ,[Squilliam cries harder],

"Narrator:, Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. ,[shows fishermen in boats fishing near the Bikini Bottom atoll],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
,SpongeBob:, Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine. ,[uses himself as a cleaning tool],
,Mr. Krabs:, They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes! ,[everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy], The hooks! The hooks!
,Fred:, How about a mint?
,Mr. Krabs:, The hooks! The hooks!
,Tom:, Can you make that to go?
,Squidward:, ,[gives Tom his food in a bag], You don't know how lucky you are.
,Mr. Krabs:, The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business...
,Squidward:, I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection. ,[puts a trashcan on his head], Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
,Mr. Krabs:, Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya.
,SpongeBob:, Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.
,SpongeBob:, The hooks?
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye. ,[shapes his arm like a hook as SpongeBob looks at his arm], The hooks. ,[The camera shows SpongeBob's face with a reflection with Mr. Krabs' arm as a hook], They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches... ,[grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie. His drink decreases every time Mr. Krabs grabs his pants as he sips it], ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher  ,[he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface], until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse...
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], What could be worse than that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Gift shops. ,[shows gift shop and the inside of the gift shop],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps and hides under a box], Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. ,[goes in the kitchen with the box on him],
,Patrick:, ,[pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows], Good morning, Krusty Krew.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go.
,SpongeBob:, I can't leave now. I'm working.
,Patrick:, It's not leaving. You're just taking a break. ,[SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen], We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni... ,[trips and falls on face], We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town. ,[many hooks are dangling], I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
,SpongeBob:, Where is everybody?
,Patrick:, I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier.
,SpongeBob:, Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... ,[bumps into a hook], Excuse me. ,[gasps as he sees the hook as the camera shows SpongeBob's face again with the reflection with a hook], Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
,Patrick:, ,[sits on a hook], Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
,SpongeBob:, All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
,[Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth],
,Patrick:, Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it. ,[the hook where Patrick ate the cheese from is pulled up],
,SpongeBob:, ,[faces another hook with cheese attached to it], But, Mr. Krabs said...
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, let me ask you something. ,[the hook that SpongeBob is facing is pulled up. Patrick is shown with 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand], Does this look dangerous?
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Patrick, don't!
,Patrick:, Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... ,[hooks pulls him up],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend. ,[Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground], Patrick, you're alive.
,Patrick:, Am I ever. You should try it.
,SpongeBob:, But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?
,Patrick:, You just jump off before you go up too high.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
,Patrick:, Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? ,[he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook],
,SpongeBob:, Well, no.
,Patrick:, Wheeee.
,SpongeBob:, I guess he didn't. ,[he jumps on the attachment with Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! ,[The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. The camera alternates between the fisherman to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off],
,SpongeBob:, Ready?
,Patrick:, Ready.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Geronimo! ,[jump off],
,SpongeBob:, This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. ,[We cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold],
,Ivy:, P.U., ,[points at his Krabby Patty], you call this food?!
,Harold:, My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
,Another Harold:, ,[Starts holding up his fried boot], My sandwich ,is, a fried boot!
,Fred:, Hurry it up, will ya? We're hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it. ,[customers muttering angrily... all talking at once; Squidward frantically flipping burnt patties],
,Squidward:, ,[defensive], Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
,Squidward:, It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break. ,[Mr. Krabs laughs], What?
,Mr. Krabs:, I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taken a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. ,[laughs], Now, what were you saying?
,Squidward:, He took a break.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stares in shocked silence, as his arms and nose fall off. He then storms out the front door], Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. ,[uses his nose to smell], Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
,Squidward:, But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help! ,[all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[uses his nose to smell again], They should be right here. ,[SpongeBob & Patrick float down as they are laughing],
,Patrick:, Again?
,SpongeBob:, Again!
,Mr. Krabs:, The hooks! No! No! No!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[pulling on hook], 1, 2, 3...
,Mr. Krabs :, Wait! Wait!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ...blastoff. ,[hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock],
,Mr. Krabs:, Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! ,[sobs], If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... ,[SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing], ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
,SpongeBob:, I...I...I...
,Patrick:, I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
,Mr. Krabs:, And do you know what happens when you ,don't, float back down?
,SpongeBob:, Gift shop?
,Mr. Krabs:, Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna. ,[shows a can of tuna], With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise! ,[shows a jar of mayo while a female screams in the background],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[raises hands], We promise, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.
,[a hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the butt],
,Mr. Krabs:, [leaps up, holding his injured rear], Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!,
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck. ,[they turn and rub their own behinds],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. ,[Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready! ,[comes running out of the house], I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. ,[Patrick comes out from his rock],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way. ,[crashes into his furniture],
,SpongeBob:, I always go to work this way.
,Patrick:, You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
,SpongeBob:, But, Patrick, we promised.
,Patrick:, Well, I had my fingers crossed.
,SpongeBob:, You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
,SpongeBob:, But Mr. Krabs said...
,Patrick:, Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
,SpongeBob:, Umm...
,Patrick:, See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun. ,[Patrick goes up and down the hooks], Come on, SpongeBob. You know you want to!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... ,[almost runs into a hook. Gasps], ...hook! ,[almost touches the hook but takes it back], Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! ,[goes back to hook], Is this seat taken? ,[hook takes him up, but when he comes down and turns around, it is shown that he is hooked at the pants], Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. ,[gasps], I'm...hooked! And that means... ,[shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside], Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
,Mr. Krabs:, Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
,Pearl:, Thanks, dad.
,Mr. Krabs:, Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
,SpongeBob:, Psst, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
,SpongeBob:, Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
,Mr. Krabs:, Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
,SpongeBob:, Umm...no. ,[hook pulls him a little closer], I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?
,SpongeBob:, Of course not. ,[hook pulls him a little closer], I mean, not exactly. ,[hook pulls him a little closer], I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it! ,[cries], Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! ,[shows the hook to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
,SpongeBob:, What am I gonna do?
,Mr. Krabs:, There's only one thing to do, boy. ,[group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls. ,[hook pulls him closer], D’oh, okay. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off. ,[takes pants off], There.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uhh... lad?
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
,Mr. Krabs:, I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. ,[he places a ""Help Wanted"" sign on the door], But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hook pulls him a little closer], Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise. ,[He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost], Please save me, Mr. Krabs! ,[cries], I promise I'll be good! ,[underwear tears off], Whew. ,[the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh],
,Girls:, Ooh, look! ,[laughs],
,Pearl:, It's SpongeBob NudeyPants! ,[SpongeBob screams and runs],
,Squidward:, ,[holding a fishing hook with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook], Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
,Squidward:, Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. ,[both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house],
,SpongeBob:, The pants! The underwear! ,[cries],
,Patrick:, ,[bus drops off a can of tuna], Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?

What could go wrong on a beautiful day like this? ,[window twists and falls off, he walks into kitchen], Gary, time for breakfast! ,[reaches for the cans of snail food on the shelf, but said shelf falls], The house must be settling. ,[pushes shelf hook into place], Oh, that's better. ,[the shelf, including the piece of wall it was on, collapses], I can fix this. I'll feed you when I'm done. ,[walks out of the kitchen],
,Gary:, ,[imitating SpongeBob], Meow meow meow meow meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hammering a board into place], Just a little handyman's know-how is all it takes, Gary! ,[hammering makes the wall fall off],
,Gary:, ,[holding food bowl], Meow meow meow meow!
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Sorry, Gary. You want to eat, huh? Don't worry, I can fix both problems.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hammers nails into the wall to fix it up], Okay, now that that's taken care of, time to feed Gary. ,[walks back inside when house gets even more rotten and goes in the kitchen with a big mess], ,[blinks then walks to the living room with another mess], Oh no!

Patrick! ,[while Patrick is snoring], Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[dreaming he is in an office silently, using a pencil and pendulum randomly. the phone beeps.],
,Telephone Girl:, Mr. Star, I have a SpongeBob SquarePants on line 3!
,Patrick:, Put him through.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Patrick! Patrick Star!
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy! You really need to get this place cleaned up.
,Squidward:, It's The Big One! It's the end of the world! Invest in gold! Hoard your drinking wa... I should've known. ,[goes to SpongeBob's house], What's going on in here?!
,SpongeBob:, You're just in time to lend a hand, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Lend a hand? No! ,[Patrick grabs Squidward and stretches him across the house],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, call Sandy! Tell her to get over here fast!
,Patrick:, ,[ties Squidward's tentacles], Say no more, buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Hurry, Patrick! I don't know how much longer I can hold this!
,Patrick:, ,[calls Sandy],
,Sandy:, Cheeks residence
,Patrick:, Sandy, don't hang up!
,Sandy:, What do you want?
,Patrick:, Oh, nothing. I'm just hanging with the sponge. How about you?
,Sandy:, Oh, you know. A little of this, a little of that, A little vacuuming...
,Patrick:, ,[chuckles], Sounds like fun. I wish I was over there. SpongeBob's house is boring. There's nothing going on over here. ,[a crashing noise is heard from the wall falling in the background],
,Sandy:, That sure don't sound like nothing. What's all the ruckus?
,Patrick:, Oh, SpongeBob's pineapple is rotting and falling apart all around us... we're doomed.
,Sandy:, I'll be right over!
,Patrick:, Oh, take your time...
,SpongeBob:, Holding steady, Patrick. But, who knows how long this support system will last?
,Squidward:, ,[SpongeBob snaps Squidward's tentacle], Ow
,Sandy:, This place sure went to pot, quick. Knockity knock, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, No, Sandy, don't! We must never, ever knock. This pineapple could topple over the slightest gesture. ,[SpongeBob goes to touch the house, but when it starts to rumble he quickly retreats his hand],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs approaches SpongeBob from behind], SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You were supposed to be at work two hours ago! ,[a massive line of customers at the Krusty Krab is shown.],
,Frank (lifeguard):, Hello? Anybody here? Hello?! ,[turns and face the other customers], Do you guys know how to make a Krabby Patty?
,Dave:, No, but I do know how to open a cash register!
,Mr. Krabs:, Your absence is costing me money!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I know. I'm sorry, but my hou...
,Mr. Krabs:, And, Squidward! I expect more from you. Well, actually, no... I don't.
,Sandy:, Well, I'm with you, SpongeBob. And I've got the toolbox to prove it!
,Patrick:,  I'm here because... wait a minute, why am I here? SpongeBob, I'm having another exit pencils crisis!
,SpongeBob:, Not now, Patrick. And Squidward has done a great job holding it up.
,Squidward:, Against my will, I might add.
,SpongeBob:, So what do you say, Mr. Krabs? Will you help?
,Mr. Krabs:,  Well... I suppose I ,could, join the cause. But, it'll have to be our standard deal.
,SpongeBob:, A week of my wages per hour?
,Mr. Krabs:, You got it, kiddo!
,Sandy:, Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get this restoration underway! ,[hands SpongeBob an armful of wooden planks],
,Sandy:, ,[Sandy uses a very elaborate machine to hammer a nail into the house.], Perfectly calibrated! ,[the hammer smashes her finger, and traps her finger], OW! ,[Sandy goes to pull away, but the machine falls on top of her],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs carves into a plank using a chisel and hammer, creating money-esque landscape.], Not a bad bit of wooden starry if I do say so meself. Time to put the finishing touches on her. ,[Mr. Krabs hammers one more time, and it falls to pieces], Hm.
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick inspects a plank, and then rams it into the decaying house],
,SpongeBob:, Um... excuse me, everyone? Not to micromanage or anything, but do any of you actually know how to build a pineapple?!
,Sandy:, Well, of course we do, silly. Firstly, every pineapple needs a solid foundation to keep it firmly in place...
,Mr. Krabs:, Not exactly, Miss Cheeks. A pineapple needs to be mobile, with a strong hull attached in case you need to skip town unexpectedly.
,Patrick:, Wrong! A pineapple needs a sweet, but tangy flavor. ,[rips out the board he previously placed in the house, eats the rotten pineapple piece dangling from the end],
,SpongeBob:, Those are all very great ideas, but...
,Sandy:, But, arguing ain't gonna get this pineapple fixed. Good point! ,[slaps SpongeBob on the back], Okay, fellas! From now on, we incorporate everyone's ideas.
,Patrick and Mr. Krabs:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, that's not exactly what I had in mind, Sandy... ,[gets run over by ""junk"" being pushed out by Sandy],
,Sandy:, First thing, you gotta do is clean out all this old junk.
,SpongeBob:, ,[crawls from pile], Sandy, my furniture is perfectly fine.
,Mr. Krabs:, Heads up! ,[runs over SpongeBob with a grill], Careful, boy. I thought I'd install a grill in your TV room for those nights where you have to bring work home with you.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but I like to watch TV in my TV room.
,Sandy:, Well, this ain't the TV room, anymore. This is your indoor garden. ,[proceeds to water plants in the room],
,SpongeBob:, But, the sofa goes there.
,Sandy:, Oh, I know. But, isn't this better?
,Gary:, Meoooowwww.
,SpongeBob:, Gary, do you ever feel like you are not being listened to?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, we need to talk.
,Sandy:, About these columns? Nice, huh? Gives the pineapple an intellectual flavor.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but I kind of liked my pineapple the way it was. I don't need all these fancy- ,[gets splattered by paint],
,Sandy:, Sorry, buddy. I-I can't understand you. You've got something in your mouth.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[painting the pineapple with a finishing trowel], Ho ho, kiddo. Look out. Just applying some plaster stucco exterior here.
,SpongeBob: ,[wipes some paint off his mouth], I guess what I'm trying to say is there's nothing wrong with a pineapple that looks like a pineapple.
,Gary:, ,[carrying a can], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Oh, no, Gary! I still haven't fed you. Let's take care of that right now, little bud-
,Patrick:, ,[pushes an oblong rock and leans it against the side of SpongeBob's house], It's just not a house without a rock to sleep under.
,Sandy:, Well, what do you think, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, It's, uh...
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes?
,SpongeBob:, It's, uh...
,Sandy:, Fantastic?
,SpongeBob:, It's, uh...
,Patrick:, I'm hungry.
,SpongeBob:, You all worked very hard.
,Mr. Krabs and Patrick:, Whoo-hoo!
,Sandy:, Yee-haw!
,Mr. Krabs:, And, since you're such a satisfied customer, I only charged you double. ,[Mr. Krabs, Sandy and Patrick all leave],
,Sandy:, Good job, fellers!
,Mr. Krabs:, Good work, boy!
,Patrick:, I'm starving. ,[chuckles],
,[cut to SpongeBob and Gary going inside their new house],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Gary. Here it is. Our new home. ,[sits down in a sand chair], Hmmm. This must be Patrick's contribution to the living room. Hey, vintage condiment jugs! Thank you, Mr. Krabs! ,[presses down on the mustard dispenser, and dry mustard flies out and lands in SpongeBob's eyes in slow motion, burning them], Yaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! ,[He screams in regular motion and runs into a futuristic bathroom], Gary, where's the sink?!
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[washes his face off in a toilet, which flushes], Gary, I don't think that was the sink.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sarcastically], Thanks for the futuristic bathroom, Sandy.
,[a robot arm grabs SpongeBob and cleans the toilet with him like a real sponge],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Well, this isn't exactly home sweet pineapple, but I suppose it could be much worse. We still a roof over our heads and food on the table. Hey, that reminds me! You still haven't eaten today, have you? Sorry, buddy. You must be famished. ,[takes a can off a shelf that Squidward is holding in place],
,Gary:, Meow.
,[Squidward's tentacles slip through the holes in the walls, and he unravels as the stucco falls off the house and everything begins falling apart],
,Squidward:, Ah! I'm unraveling! ,[the pineapple collapses to dust], If you ever, and I mean ever- ,[his neck cracks], Ow! My neck. I'm gonna be in the chiropractor's for a week. ,[walks sadly away],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Gary. There's only one thing left to do: ,[picks up the phone], call and have this place condemned. ,[dials the phone as Gary leaves to get something], Hello, operator. City hall, please, Office of Broken Dreams.
,Gary:, ,[returns with his food can], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary, I'm sorry. With all this house ruckus, I completely forgot to feed you. Here you go, buddy. ,[SpongeBob opens the can, and a huge pineapple house flies out, landing on the pile of remains of SpongeBob's old house. SpongeBob reads what the can says], ""Furnished Pineapple in a Can."" Oh, Gary! You are the best! ,[laughs and hugs Gary, ending the episode],

"[Episode starts in the Krusty Krab with Squidward taking a fish's order],

,Frankie Billy:, Uhh...

,SpongeBob:, ,[is reading order], One double Krabby Patty with everything on it, one order of kelp fries, one... ,[looks confused at order], Squidward, what size of kelp fries are these?
,Frankie Billy:, Uhh...
,Squidward:, Medium.
,SpongeBob:, Comin' right up! ,[SpongeBob rubs the order ticket on Squidward's head then disappears to the kitchen. Cooks the patty with steam rising up as SpongeBob brings the kelp fries. Brings the order but SpongeBob slips in a puddle of grease, the order flies into the customer's face],
,Frankie Billy:, Now that's what I call fast food! ,[eats on his way out],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks by], Squidward! What's all the hubberub? ,[Squidward's blank look], SpongeBob! What's all the hubberub?
,SpongeBob:, Uh.. I'm not sure Mr. Krabs. I was bringing the customer's order, and then I slipped and fell in this grease slick. I think I may be hurt real bad.
,Mr. Krabs:, Grease slick, eeh? ,[opens the shaft door],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh... what is it?
,Mr. Krabs:, That me boy, is a grease trap.
,SpongeBob:, Kinda looks like nobody has cleaned out the trap for awhile.
,Mr. Krabs:, No SpongeBob, you're right. But, that's a big job, a job that only 2 volunteer employees can do for no extra pay. ,[Squidward disappears],
,SpongeBob:, Yea!
,[A tanker is parked out side with a tube connected to the grease trap],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm... Nothing's coming out.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs. Can I see that? Saw this in a movie once. ,[sucks the tube in order to get the grease out but nothing come out], mmm... Yeah maybe i wasn't doing it right. ,[grease spews out onto Mr. Krabs' face], Oh never mind! I was. ,[fills up the tank], Yeah.. Nothing like a long night siphoning grease to put some hair on your chest, Eh? Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Well Now we got the ol' grease trap cleaned out, what do you think we should do with all this excess grease?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm.
,[scene cuts to Mr. Krabs sitting next to SpongeBob, who is driving a tanker truck filled with grease],
,Mr. Krabs:, Right behind there. ,[SpongeBob pulls up behind Chum Bucket, presses ‘SPILL’ button, and grease spills out], Alright. Let's get out of here! ,[SpongeBob drives away],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, are you sure that was... legal?
,Krabs:, ,[elongated], Legal?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, legal.
,Krabs:, Hmm..
,[scene cuts to the front of the Chum Bucket and then behind it. Door with ‘DO NOT ENTER’ sign opens and Plankton walks out, humming, and carrying a garbage can],
,Plankton:, ,[slipping on grease], Wyaagh! ,[Plankton falls on greasy ground], What the? ,[Trash can falls, scaring Plankton], This is the most bizarre precipitation I've ever slipped and fallen in. ,[sniffs grease], Eeeaugh! It reeks! ,[tastes grease], But it tastes delicious! ,[looks at greasy ground], Darn it, I almost had an idea! ,[sits and sulks], Oh, I do. I do have an idea! ,[maniacal laughing],!
,Karen:, Plankton!
,Plankton:, Coming dear.
,[there is a long line going to Chum Bucket and Mr. Krabs is behind it from Krusty Krab's window.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Somethin' is terribly wrong, Squidward!
,Squidward:, And it's taken you this long to figure that out?
,Krabs:, Plankton has had a line of customers... all mornin'!
,Squidward:, So?
,Mr. Krabs:, So I'm gonna go find ,[slaps fist in hand], out what that rascal's up to! ,[goes to Chum Bucket], Excuse me! Excuse me! Comin' through! ,[walks by three chewing fish. Stops by the sign], What the? ,[puts on reading glasses], Try Plankton's... new delicerous... Chummy Patties... now with edible flavor? ,[sniffs air], Clearly somethin' crabby is goin' on here.
,Plankton:, ,[in Chum Bucket], Next Chumstomer, please. ,[sees Mr. Krabs and is a little surprised], Well, Well, Eugene Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Save the formalities for your mother-in-law, Plankton! Yeh stole my Krabby Patty Formuler, and I want it back!
,Plankton:, Sorry to disappoint, Krabs, but I've done no such thing. I'm simply using a gift somebody left me to make my chum taste good.
,Mr. Krabs:, A gift?
,Plankton:, Sheh! It's almost like I got a personal visit from the Flavor Fairy!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stunned, but then a little aggravated], Be that as it may, Plankton! It takes two to tango.
,Plankton:, Wha?
,[scene cuts to Krusty Krab's kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[opens door], SpongeBob! Stop what you're doing!
,SpongeBob:, But Mr. Krabs, I'm not doing anything!
,Mr. Krabs:, Never mind that now, I've got some new directions for yeh. From now on, I want you to fry up ,[pulls two patties from behind back], two Patties for every Krabby Patty we sell! ,[drops one patty on grill], One for the patty itself, and the ,[drops second patty on grill], second, just for the grease! Then, ,[picks up second patty and starts scraping it of with spatula], slather the grease from the second patty onto the first one and ,[tosses second patty away], Voalora! It's A deluxe Krabby Patty with extra flavor! ,[SpongeBob burns eye from grease coming on it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding eye], Mr. Krabs, do you think it might be kinda... unhealthy to be feeding people all this grease?
,Mr. Krabs:, Unhealthy? Boy, didn't anybody tell yeh?
,SpongeBob:, Tell me what, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, Questions are a danger to you... ,[holds out spatula], and a burden to others. ,[hands SpongeBob's spatula and walks away],
,Mr. Krabs:, Lil' lower! Lil' more! More! Lil' more! Okay, A little to the left now! Up a bit! Okay wait, that's too far. Alright, alright, perfect, right there!
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, I hope whatever you're yelling about is something more important than my mid-morning nap!
,Mr. Krabs:, Just hangin' a new sign, Squidward! ,[worker unveils sign that says ‘Now Serving! DELUXE Krabby Patties!’],
,Squidward:, Deluxe Krabby Patties. ,[in sarcasm], Juuust what the world needed.
,Mr. Krabs:, Shh! Okay, a little higher now!
,[scene cuts to the front of the Chum Bucket],
,Harold:, Hey, look at that!
,Nat:, What?
,Harold:, There! Right up there!
,Nat:, Where? I don't see anything!
,Harold:, A little to the right...
,Nat:, Oh okay, I see it!
,Harold:, ,[to crowd], There's an new sign up at the Krusty Krab! It says they're serving something called a deluxe Krabby Patty!
,Nat:, That sounds delicious!
,Harold:, You're telling me, I'm gonna try one! ,[runs to the Krusty Krab and then whole line of fish runs to Krusty Krab],
,Plankton:, Next Chumstomer in line, please! ,[zoom out of empty Chum Bucket], Hello? ,[seat falls over],
,[scene starts in Krusty Krab, and the screen darts to the right],
,Frankie Billy:, These are delicious!
,Norma:, Right! I can't imagine what makes them taste so good! ,[bites into deluxe Krabby Patty],
,[we see huge eye],
,Plankton:, ,[puts down telescope], Well, well, well, now I do see what Krabs meant when he said two could play that game. But he's a bigger fool than he realizes if he thinks old Plankton it gonna take this one lying down! ,[looks down, and stands up], Uhhh... Meh.
,Harold:, Man am I stuffed!
,Frank:, Me, too! But that deluxe Krabby Patty was so swimmin' good, I'm gonna get another one!
,Harold:, Sounds like a plan!
,Nat:, Hold it, what's that sign say?
,Frank:, It looks like it says, ""NEW: ULTRA CHUMMY PATTIES PACKED WITH QUADRUPLE GRILLED GOODNESS!"" ,[all three fish look at each other, then get out of their tables and run to Chum Bucket],
,[there is a long line at Chum Bucket, and the scene darts to the right, with Mr. Krabs standing in front of Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Quadruple goodness?! ,[mumbles], We'll see about that. ,[in the Krusty Krab, we see SpongeBob, sweating and cooking Krabby Patties], Keep the grill goin' nonstop to crank out as much grease as possible!
,SpongeBob:, Okay ,Mr. Krabs. I never turn the grill off, but I can turn it off even less than that if you want.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uhh... I already see the... ,[slips on grease], Whoa! ,[clattering sound], Gribbets Mollusk! ,[picks up greasy bun], Eeeagh! What in the name of Neptune is this?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry Mr. Krabs. I accidentally dropped some buns into our vat of extra grease. They've been soakin' there for about an hour. ,[Eugene smiles],
,[sign outside the Krusty Krab that says:, ""New! Yummy Bunz over an Hour of flavor in every bun""],
,Plankton:, Yummy Bunz huh? Well you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that Krabs, once the hungry public hears about MY newest creation.
,Karen:, Creation? My scanner shows that's nothing more than a burnt grease crumb.
,Plankton:, You're right! And it's packed with flavor!
,[cut to a sign outside the Chum Bucket that says ""Crispity Crunchities Fried grease crumbs packed with flavor"". Cut again to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs walks by Squidward with pure grease on a plate],
,Squidward:, P.U, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh?
,Squidward:, Don't you usually flush that stuff down the toilet?
,Mr. Krabs:, This is our latest product! It's pure grease on a paper plate!
,Squidward:, I'll give you points for honesty.
,[cut to a sign that says, ""New! Wow! Soup only at Krusty Krab"". Cut again to SpongeBob in the kitchen preparing some soup],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! Get those seven orders of Wow soup out to table 3 pronto! We gotta keep these customers happy or Plankton will steal them back!
,[SpongeBob walks out with the soup to find that the entire Krusty Krab is covered in grease and the customers look horrible. A fish walks by SpongeBob covered in grease],
,Frank:, Are you going to eat that?
,SpongeBob:, It was supposed to be going to table 3.
,Frank:, Okay.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[startles SpongeBob], SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob flips the plate over and the grease lands back on the plate],
,SpongeBob:, Sir yes sir!
,Mr. Krabs:, Are you gonna get that soup served to table 3 or are you gonna wait til it gets up and walks there itself?
,SpongeBob:, Actually, Mr. Krabs, I've been thinking. And well, don't you think maybe this whole grease thing has gone a bit to far? ,[Mr. Krabs laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, You know what I think SpongeBob? I think you should be thinking about NOT thinking and get back to work! ,[Patrick stumbles in fat and grease-covered],
,Patrick:, Gotta... Have... Crunchity... Munchities... ,[Patrick falls over and SpongeBob runs to his side],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Oh no! Not my best friend, too! ,[he gets an assertive look on his face. Cut to a health inspector riding in on the truck. He finds the entire area is covered in grease],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasp], Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?!
,Plankton:, Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?
,Health inspector:, Did somebody call a... Health inspector?
,SpongeBob:, It was me sir. I just wanted to tell you that... Well, for the past two weeks, Plankton and Mr. Krabs have been... ,[short pause], they've been feeding people grea... ,[he's cut off as Mr. Krabs picks him up and throws him in an attempt to shut him up], they've been feeding people...,[Plankton closes the lid], 
,Health inspector:, What is going on here?
,Mr. Krabs:, Nothing, Mr. Inspector.
,SpongeBob:, They've been feeding people...,[Mr. Krabs kicks SpongeBob away],
,Plankton:, Just a friendly competition between old...
,Mr. Krabs and Plankton:, F-f-f-f-f-
,Plankton:, Friends?
,Mr. Krabs:, Friends, right.
,SpongeBob:, ,[rolls off the cliff and speaks out loud], They're feeding people grease!
,Health inspector:, Well! I thought I recognized this horrible stench. But I thought that maybe just one of you two hadn't showered in a while.
,Plankton:, Uh, Officer! Officer I would just like to state for the record that umm, ,[points to Mr. Krabs], this was all his idea! All of it!
,Health inspector:, Oh, really? Well, in that case, you'll be happy to know I'll be ordering BOTH of your restaurants to be closed down until the two of you slime balls can clean up your act! ,[climbs in his truck], Good day. ,[as he leaves he gets grease all over Mr. Krabs and Plankton],
,Plankton:, Well, I'm taking a bath. ,[he walks off as SpongeBob walks in with his hat in his hands and a sad look on his face],
,Mr. Krabs:, I guess this is it, boy. The end of an era.
,SpongeBob:, No, it's not the end, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, It is. Unless I can find a way to get this grease soaked up. ,[SpongeBob gets an idea],
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute. Did you say soaked up?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, what difference does it make?
,SpongeBob:, ,[with a giddy look on his face], You'll see!
,[cut to Mr. Krabs sleeping in front of the Krusty Krab he wakes up to find the grease gone],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah. It was all a dream! ,[SpongeBob appears full of grease],
,SpongeBob:, No it wasn't, Mr. Krabs! I soaked up all the offending substances from the surrounding area and I'm gonna go dispose of them properly. The Krusty Krab is grease free! ,[Patrick runs up to him and sees that hes full of grease and he starts licking SpongeBob], Patrick, No! ,[he ignores this and licks his hand],
,Patrick:, Mmm. Crunchity Munchities!
,SpongeBob:, Stop it! Stop it! Go away! No! No! ,[SpongeBob runs away with Patrick in tow. Mr. Krabs has a look on his face],

"French narrator:, Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...
,Squidward:, ,[talks cheerfully as he switches the “Open” sign to ""Closed""], Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is: ,[pulls out his clarinet], Clarinet. ,[Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet], What?
,Tom:, Are you open?
,Squidward:, ,[points to the sign], Read the sign.
,Tom:, ,[ignores him], I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a double chili kelp fries.
,Squidward:, No, you won't! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.
,Tom:, Well, fine, if you don't want my money!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[says cheerfully], Money?! ,[Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward], You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
,Tom:, ,[pulls out cash; Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him], Sure!
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, ,[tears up the “Closed” sign], welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.
,Squidward:, What!? ,[crowd of fish barge in cheering],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs..
,Mr. Krabs:, See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life., [leaves],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs?
,SpongeBob:, Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! ,[gasps], It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! ,[jumps on cash register counter], Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
,Squidward:, ,[Sandals walks up to counter; Squidward hands him a baseball bat], Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
,SpongeBob:, Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen ,[laughs], at night!
,Squidward:, ,[takes hat off; leans head on counter], Don't hold back.
,SpongeBob:, ,[cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen], Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night. ,[cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself], Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. ,[cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up spatula, misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams], I burned my hand!...at night. ,[cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge], Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!
,Squidward:, Will you please?! Here, ,[hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage], give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
,SpongeBob:, All right! ,[takes bag from Squidward], Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. ,[stops at the door], You mean outside?
,Squidward:, That's where the dumpster is, yes.
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Squidward, ,[leans face against window], it's kinda dark out there.
,Squidward:, But I thought you liked the night shift.
,SpongeBob:, You're right! ,[lifts bag over his head], For the Krusty Krab! ,[runs out of the building to the dumpster, screaming and panicking the whole way; reenters the building panting heavily. He snaps his fingers and confidently says], Piece of cake!
,Squidward:, So you're not afraid?
,SpongeBob:, Pfft, nah.
,Squidward:, Well I am. Especially after, ,[looks around, gulps], well, you know.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around], What? What do I know?
,Squidward:, You don't remember? It was all over the news.
,SpongeBob:, Tell me! Tell me!
,Squidward:, No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. ,[gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly],
,SpongeBob:, ,[excitedly], What happened, what happened, what happened!?
,Squidward:, You mean you've never heard the story of the ,[thinks], ""Hash-Slinging Slasher?""
,SpongeBob:, The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
,Squidward:, The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
,SpongeBob:, The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
,Squidward:, Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha---,[breaks into scream], because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
,SpongeBob:, ,[begging], Tell me the story!
,Squidward:, Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
,SpongeBob:, He forgot the secret sauce?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, He didn't wash his hands?
,Squidward:, No!
,SpongeBob:, Irregular portions?
,Squidward:, No! He cut off his own hand by mistake.
,SpongeBob:, You mean like this? ,[pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place], Or like this? ,[pulls it again, another one grows back], Or this? ,[does it again], Or this? ,[does it again], But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or...
,Squidward:, ,[interrupts], Except he wasn't a sponge!
,SpongeBob:, ,[ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line], So?
,Squidward:, So it didn't grow back!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Oh, no! ,[all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away],
,Squidward:, And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
,SpongeBob:, Tuesday.
,Squidward:, Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], But tonight's Tuesday night!
,Squidward:, Then he'll be coming.
,SpongeBob:, How will we know?
,Squidward:, There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
,Harold:, ,[interrupts], Dude, can I have some ketchup?
,Squidward:, Oh, here you go. ,[hands him ketchup], Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. ,[shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails], And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over. ,[shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those and then he eats his arms like popcorn], Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead! ,[SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn], Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand..
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Squidward:, He opens the door ,[pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a squeaky door opening. leans towards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in], He slowly approaches the counter ,[""counter"" echoes menacingly], ...and you know what he does next?
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, You really want to know?
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, Are you sure you want to know?
,SpongeBob:, What, what, what does he do?!
,Squidward:, ,[sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him], He gets ya! ,[SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing], SpongeBob... ,[continues screaming], SpongeBob I wa... ,[screaming continues], I was ju... ,[SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too], I was jus... ,[screaming continues], SpongeBob, I was joking!
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, It's not true! None of it's true!
,SpongeBob:, It's not?
,Squidward:, Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
,SpongeBob:, Ohhhhh. ,[laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming], ,[cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever'],
,[Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning], Isn't this great, Squidward? ,[Squidward screams], There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.
,Squidward:, ,[says to himself], Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
,[cuts to Patrick's bedroom],
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick's alarm clock goes off], Oh, boy! Three A.M.! ,[whips out a Krabby Patty and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here! ,[lights start to flicker on and off], Very funny, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, ""And the lights will flicker on and off."" Just like the story. I get it. ,[realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?
,Squidward:, I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! ,[phone rings, Squidward picks it up], What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up to the counter], Nice try, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Nice try, what?
,SpongeBob:, ""The phone will ring and there will be no one there."" ,[raises eyebrows up and down and giggles], Oh, you crack me up.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. ,[hangs up phone], Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, ,[lights flicker on and off], and the phone, ,[phone rings], and the walls will ooze green slime! ,[walls start to ooze green slime], No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? ,[hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up to the counter], I didn't know the buses ran this late. 
,Squidward:, They don't! ,[a man gets out of the bus and the bus pulls away, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline],
,SpongeBob:, Well, they're dropping someone off. ,[from the outside, the man lifts his spatula],
,Squidward:, ,[screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling],
,Squidward:, The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...
,SpongeBob:, The Hash-Slinging Slasher! ,[starts to cry],
,Squidward:, At last you understand! We're doomed!
,SpongeBob:, No, that's not it. ,[wipes tear], I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me! ,[cries again],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!? ,[the man taps on the door with his spatula],
,SpongeBob:,  ,[screams to the point where his eyelashes grow and start wiggling],
,SpongeBob and Squidward:, The Hash-Slinging Slasher! ,[the guy walks in the door and up to the counter],
,Squidward:, ,[screams],
,SpongeBob:, He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[a nerdy unnamed guy reaches the counter],
,SpongeBob:, Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!
,Richard:, Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula. ,[holds up spatula], I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.
,SpongeBob:, Do you have references?
,Squidward:, Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? ,[lights flicker on and off; SpongeBob, Squidward, and Richard look over to see Nosferatu],
,SpongeBob, Squidward and Richard:, Nosferatu!

,Gary:, Meow!
,SpongeBob:, ‘Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! ‘Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?! ,[laughs, Gary leaves, SpongeBob continues laughing until a fly from the gift flies into his mouth, SpongeBob chokes],
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese? ,[SpongeBob tries heimliching himself, Patrick realizes SpongeBob's choking], Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you! ,[Patrick punches SpongeBob and the fly comes out],
,Patrick:, Buddy! You okay?
,SpongeBob:, Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises. ,[gets a watermelon], Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again, buddy. HIYA! ,[chops the watermelon],

,SpongeBob:,  What, what, you mean karate?
,Patrick:, Uh-huh!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...
,Patrick:, If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah... However...
,Patrick:, I also remember you saying, ""If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I did say that, Patrick, but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface. ,[Patrick runs over],
,Patrick:, Then teach me.
,SpongeBob:, As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.
,Patrick:, Oh yeah! Mama! ,[cuts to training],
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Let’s start off simple. This is a basic move called ""the inverted whirlpool"".
,Patrick:, Inverty whirpey... Got it! ,[SpongeBob lays on head and twists feet, he starts moving and blasts through the objects],
,Patrick:, Woohoo! That was awesome!
,SpongeBob:, Think you can handle that?

,Harold:, Neptune's trousers! What's that?! ,[screams and runs away. Patrick destroys lemonade stand; cuts to next stage of training],
,SpongeBob:, Now, this is very easy, watch closely. ,[Does a move], Haa-haah. You got it?
,Patrick:, Definitely! ,[Patrick does the same but spins out of control, SpongeBob stops him and he falls],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable. ,[walks away],
,Patrick:, What?! I...! ,[gets mad and chops through cinder blocks], Barnacles!
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks in amazement], Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!
,Patrick:, Wow!
,SpongeBob:, You're a natural! A karate genius!
,Patrick:, Clamo!
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds a sword], Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- ,[Patrick cuts it in half],. Wow. Amazing! ,[cuts to an old abandoned ship],

,SpongeBob:, Not that! ,[pulls out a tape recorder], ...this. ,[SpongeBob's voice on recorder],: With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
,Patrick:, Yesss...
,SpongeBob:, Good! ,[his watch beeps], Oh man, I'm late for work. ,[runs], See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.
,Patrick:, Okay! I'm a genius! ,[cuts to Patrick's rock],
,Patrick:, ,[chops hot dogs], Karate power! ,[eats part of the hot dog, cuts to Patrick at the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, ,[looking at magazine], What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, look, it's Patrick!
,Patrick:, Hi-yah, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, What are you doing... ,[Patrick chops the door],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Dear Neptune!
,Patrick:, Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!
,Squidward:, A... What?
,Patrick:, I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?
,Squidward:, ,[sighs],
,Patrick:, ,[chops the meal in half], Looks delish.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?
,Patrick:, I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due.
,SpongeBob:, But, but, but-
,Patrick:, No buts! Just hands. ,[chops door again],
,SpongeBob:, Oooohhh!
,Mr. Krabs:, You do realize I'm taking that out of your pay check.
,[cuts to Patrick at the ice cream shop],
,Patrick:, Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch! ,[ice cream is really tall], Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!
,Lou:, We're all out. In fact, we're out of everything, which means you owe us $86.50
,Patrick:, What do you say to a trade? ,[pulls out a disgusting lollipop],
,Lou:, I say, pay up before I call the cops.
,Patrick:, You dare refuse my barter?!?! Then accept my chop! ,[chops tip jar and ice cream flies into Patrick's mouth, he eats it and becomes fat. He becomes frozen and chops out of the ice], Ahhh... I don't feel so good.
,Billy:, Aha! Hand in the tip jar again, eh! ,[Patrick is stuck in door and chops it open],
,Patrick:, ,[sniffs], What is that wonderful stench? ,[walks to Harold Fish], Whatcha got there?
,Harold:, Spinach and chocolate spaghetti in calamari sauce. You wanna bite?
,Patrick:, ,[chops the food], NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha! ,[cuts to Bikini Bottom Arcade, Patrick chops a game],
,Patrick:, I win, I win, I win! ,[cuts to Krusty Krab],
,Patrick:, HIYAA HIYAA-
,Lifeguard fish:, Help! Help! There's a mad chopper on the loose!
,SpongeBob:, Mad chopper?! Patrick!
,Lifeguard fish:, We need the cops, kid!
,SpongeBob:, Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen.
,Lifeguard fish:, Don't do it kid. ,[grabs his ankle],
,SpongeBob:, Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me.
,Lifeguard fish:, You don't know what you're doing. Don't walk out that door! NOOOOO! ,[SpongeBob on his unicycle, Patrick chops a car],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you doing?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy. ,[chops his unicycle],
,SpongeBob:, For what?
,Patrick:, For teaching me how to karate chop, silly.
,SpongeBob:, You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!
,Patrick:, ,[looks at the destruction], Wooooooooooo.
,SpongeBob:, Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?
,Patrick:, You got it, buddy. No more karate chops! ,[chops a jail truck],
,SpongeBob:, You're still chopping!
,Patrick:, I know! Weird, huh?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, stop it!
,Patrick:, Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop! ,[Patrick chops his hand and it hits his face]"",
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs Patrick’s arm], You must resist! ,[flings SpongeBob on a fire hydrant], AHHHHHAAHH! ,[Patrick's hand pulls him away and his hand chops Squidward's hedge sculpture],
,SpongeBob:, Wait up, Patrick! ,[gasps], Triton's tunic!
,Fish [off-screen]:, He's headed straight for the Barg'N-Mart!
,[Everyone screams and runs away],
,Patrick:, ,[in the store], HIYA YA! Oh, no! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH! ,[chops it],
,News Reporter:, This just in, a mad man is chopping everything.
,Patrick:, Not the giant-screen TVs! ,[chops it], Oh no!
,News Reporter:, The suspect is considered fat, pink, and dangerous.
,Patrick:, Oh, oh! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA! ,[chops one and falls],
,SpongeBob:, Pull it together, buddy!
,Patrick:, I'm trying to, but this thing has a mind of its owwwnnnn... ,[punches SpongeBob, SpongeBob hits a rack], YAAAAAA! ,[then the counter, until the whole store collapses. He emerges from the rubble.],
,Patrick:,  SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! ,[spots a kitchen sponge], Oh, no! I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag. ,[cries and hugs it],
,Dennis:, ,[Emerges from the debris], That isn’t your friend, you kelp-for-brains. Those are cleaning sponges.
,Patrick:, ,[Looks at the pack closer and throws it away, becomes relieved], So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?
,Dennis:, Ummmm...I wouldn't say that. ,[Points him to rubble covering SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, ,[sees the pile of rubble], SpongeBob! Oh no! ,[pushes rubble off SpongeBob and gasps], Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself ,[cries], No! I'll never forgive you! ,[points to his and, pulls it off],
,SpongeBob:, ,[wakes up], Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you're okay!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Your arm!
,Patrick:, Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?
,SpongeBob:, Hooray for regeneration!
,Patrick:, And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here! ,[rebuilds the Barg'N Mart],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the unnatural details.
,Patrick #2:, HIYAAA! ,[chops shopping cart],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!
,Patrick:, Oh, I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies.
,Patrick #2:, HIYYAA! ,[Barg'N Mart collapses again],

,Gary:, Meow.

,Announcer:, Karate Island: A serene and exotic location where nature and beauty abound, and hundreds of fighting styles collide in a wave of non-stop, pulsating, no-hold barred action! For centuries, the world's top karate artists have journeyed to this land to be crowned King of Karate.

,Sandy:, Howdy, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.
,Sandy:, Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.
,Sandy:, But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited.
,SpongeBob:, Maybe your karate ,was, the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.
,Sandy:, There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up.
,SpongeBob:, All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment. ,[laughs. Scene cuts to both in a boat heading towards Karate Island], Are we there yet?
,Sandy:, Yup. That's it over there.
,SpongeBob:, What make you think that's Karate Island? ,[big sign that says ""Welcome to Karate Island"" is pointing at the island],
,Sandy:, I don't know -- lucky guess? ,[three fish are waiting on top of some rocks for SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Sandy arrive on the island],
,SpongeBob:, Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.
,Fish:, Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san. ,[bows],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, thank you. ,[bows],
,Master Udon:, I am Master Udon.
,Sandy:, Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.
,Sandy:, Oh, brother.
,Master Udon:, Please, show me some of your moves, Master SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, You hear that, Sandy? He called me ""master."" Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em. ,[three fighters appear],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.
,SpongeBob:, Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister. ,[shouts karate yells at the first fighter. He falls to the ground], Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?
,Sandy:, Something smells like rancid rodeo around here. ,[all the fighters are knocked out],
,Master Udon:, Excellent. Truly, you are King of Karate.
,SpongeBob:, The one and only.
,Master Udon:, We must make ready for your coronation.
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready to be King of Karate! ,[gong sounds],
,Master Udon:, King of Karate-san, it is time for you to take your rightful place on your throne.
,SpongeBob:, My throne. ,[floats over to the throne],
,Sandy:, All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sitting on his throne], Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement. ,[claps twice], Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend. ,[chair is brought],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, ya'll are getting a bit wily.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?
,Sandy:, Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
,Sandy:, I'm getting off this crazy train! ,[mumbles],
,Master Udon:, Master, don't worry about her. She is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. ,[laughs], Let the coronation begin!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy's going to miss out, big time. ,[suddenly SpongeBob is chained down to the throne. Master Udon reaches into his robe and takes out a pen],
,Sandy:, That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting -- and that ain't much.
,SpongeBob:, No!
,Sandy:, SpongeBob's in trouble! ,[SpongeBob screams], SpongeBob is the ""King of Karate"". He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself.
,SpongeBob:, ,[in the distance], Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.
,Sandy:, Hold on, buddy! ,[enters a building where Master Udon is watching from above],
,SpongeBob:, No, Sandy!
,Master Udon:, She will never reach you. She must first pass through the 'Four Floors of Fear'.
,Sandy:, ,[enters first room], SpongeBob?
,The Tickler:, Ha. Ha-ha-ha. You cannot pass unless you defeat me, The Tickler, and my iron-finger style. ,[both get ready then attack], Ha-ha. Look!
,Sandy:, Huh? ,[laughs as she is being tickled],
,The Tickler:, Prepare for the tickling of your life!
,Sandy:, Taste these! ,[has a plate full of jelly-filled donuts],
,The Tickler:, Oh no! Jelly-filled donuts? How did you know they were my weakness?
,Sandy:, No one can resist jelly-filled. ,[throws the donuts into The Tickler's mouth], Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed.
,The Tickler:, I could use a wet napkin.
,Sandy:, ,[enters floor two], All right, who's next?
,Lip Service:, Halt! No one advances past me, Lip Service, and my power-flexi dynamo-lip thruster style. ,[attacks Sandy],
,Lip Service:, Dance, squirrel, dance. ,[her lips send Sandy backwards],
,Sandy:, Advanced hair-dryer style!
,Lip Service:, ,[laughs], What do you expect to do with that? ,[Sandy uses the hair-dryer to blow air on Lip Service’s lips, making them chapped], Oh, no! Not chapped lips! ,[takes out some lip balm. Applies some, but it breaks her lips],
,Sandy:, That's enough lip out of you. ,[enters third floor, but slips on her way in, because it's covered in mud. She slides into a big green Jabba The Hutt look-alike],
,Filthy Phil:, No one has ever made it to the lair of Filthy Phil. No one passes except me. Now, feel the steam of my horrible body odor. ,[strains to get body odor out. The body odor tries to get into Sandy's helmet, but can't],
,Sandy:, Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome.
,Filthy Phil:, Fresh-air dome? ,[inhales his own body odor], Man, I really do stink. ,[passes out. Sandy breaks through some boards to enter floor four where Master Udon is],
,Master Udon:, You are one impressive squirrel. You even made a costume change.
,Sandy:, Release SpongeBob!
,Master Udon:, Never. ,[as Sandy is going to attack, she is trapped in a bird cage. She strains to break through, but she can't], He is forbidden to leave until...he signs this contract.
,Sandy:, What are you talking about?
,Master Udon:, Real estate.
,Sandy:, You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?
,Master Udon:, Yes. If there was a real Karate Island, I'd be a millionaire.
,SpongeBob:, You mean I'm not King of Karate?
,Master Udon:, No. But you could be King of Condos. Here, let me explain. It's really quite simple. ,[pulls down chart], See, if you invest in a time share here on Condo Island, you can see your equity increase ten-fold. Perhaps you and your yellow friend would like to set up a timeshare plan?
,SpongeBob:, Don't do it, Sandy! ,[Sandy chants something],
,Sandy:, ,[breaks the bird cage], I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!
,Master Udon:, Then give into my fists. ,[rips off robe and exposes his speedo and to show a more buff Master Udon. Sandy does the same by ripping off her jumpsuit then exposing her bikini to reveal a buff Sandy. Both flex their bodies, starting with the extra muscles like Sandy’s Tail along with Master Udon’s Eyebrows next The Chests,Arms,Legs and they both do primal roars,then fight.They miss each other from Charging.Master Udon turns back to get her. Sandy jumps on top of Master Udon's head, then slaps him with her feet. Master Udon then grabs Sandy by her ankles then spins her around and throws her into the wall. Sandy retaliates by springing of the wall and landing in front of Master Udon They karate chop some more before Sandy grabs him and throws him on the ground over and over. She then throws him in the air and kicks him in the face, sending him outside of the tower and falling into the ocean],
,Sandy:, You're in the soup now, Udon! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy walking toward their boat],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from... ,[swallows hard], buying a condo.
,Sandy:, Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for.
,SpongeBob:, I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?
,Sandy:, You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location... ,[boat drives off as another boat, carrying Squidward, arrives],
,Squidward:, I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived! ,[Master Udon is waiting on top of the rocks again],

Yeah... ,[tip toes over to the couch, but makes duck sounds as he tip toes. He realizes he's been stepping on squeaky ducks, and in frustration, he kicks them away. Then he runs in front of his couch], I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge... ,[jumps behind the couch and no one is there], ...Bob. ,[has his back to the couch while he squeezes his eyes through the couch looking for Sandy.

Hi-yah! ,[no one is there, so he sits on the couch and watches TV], Well, I guess the coast is clear.

,Sandy:, Hi-yah! Yah. ,[SpongeBob grabs her hand and spins her around],

,Sandy:, I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!

,Sandy:, Hello? ,[SpongeBob's arm tries to karate chop Sandy, but Sandy takes SpongeBob's hand and puts it through the phone to karate chop himself], Nice try, SpongeBrain! ,[hangs up phone. Later, at Barg’N’Mart, Sandy is shopping when a box of Kelpo falls. She thinks it's SpongeBob, so she gets in her karate stance], Yah! ,[notices the box of Kelpo], Heh, silly me. ,[But when she walks a few more steps, SpongeBob is there in his karate gear],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?
,Sandy:, I don't think so.
,SpongeBob:, Well, it goes like this! ,[stretches his arm to ricochet off a shelf and the ceiling to come at Sandy], Oh, wait, I forgot the punch line. ,[His arm stops right before hitting Sandy], Oh, yeah! ,[hits the loose board on the floor, sending Sandy into a pile of tin cans], That's a good one, isn't it? ,[later, SpongeBob is walking down the road], What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful... ,[sees a pile of tin cans on the ground], pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet. ,[He puts on karate gear],
,Sandy:, No it's not, SpongeBob. ,[shows him a squirrel mask], This is! ,[jumps in front of SpongeBob], Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping! ,[grabs SpongeBob's tongue and takes out a bottle of hot sauce], Mmmm, my favorite.

,SpongeBob:, Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
,Sandy:, I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob.

,SpongeBob:, But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.
,Mr. Krabs:, Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
,SpongeBob:, No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.

He tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen! ,[SpongeBob is crying into a cup and drinking his tears. Now he's flipping over and over around Sandy and Mr. Krabs], Give him another chance, please?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmmm. ,[grabs SpongeBob as he runs], Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind. ,[sniffs Sandy], Mmm, mammals. ,[walks off],
,Sandy:, Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing. ,[she and SpongeBob sigh], Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about ,[karate chops SpongeBob], this?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs, then suddenly stops], Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
,Sandy:, We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.
,SpongeBob:, We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh. ,[picks up a rock], We can squeeze things! ,[squeezes the rock and drops it], Woo! How much fun was that?
,Sandy:, Almost some.

,Sandy:, Karate.
,SpongeBob:, What did you say?
,Sandy:, Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich. ,[takes out some mustard], There we go. ,[SpongeBob pulls out some barnacle loaf],

,Sandy:, One. Just one.

,SpongeBob:, And one for me! ,[chops off another slice in slow-motion],
,Sandy:, Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Hmm?
,Sandy:, Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry.
,[SpongeBob brings out the barnacle loaf again],
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, Sandy. ,[lifts up his hand],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah?
,Sandy:, Do you think, umm, do you think I could cut this one?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, sure.
,Sandy:, Thanks. Hi-yah! ,[chops one slice], Is that enough?
,SpongeBob:, Maybe just one more. Or two!
,Sandy:, Or three!
,SpongeBob:, Or ten!
,Sandy:, Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!
,SpongeBob:, Right!
,Sandy:, Right!
,SpongeBob:, Right!
,Sandy:, Right! ,[chops off more slices and they fly everywhere],
,SpongeBob:, Time for buns! ,[throws a bunch of buns in the air and chops them in half],
,Sandy:, How about some tomatoes?
,SpongeBob:, And I'll cut the cheese! ,[both throw the cheese and tomatoes in the air while chopping them into a bunch of slices that land on the patties],
,Sandy:, And, what else should we slice? ,[SpongeBob grabs more buns],
,SpongeBob:, More buns!
,Sandy:, ,[Sandy grabs two heads of lettuce], And lettuce!
,Both:, Yeah! ,[both slice up more food to complete their Krabby Patties and one of the buns lands on an earthworm],
,SpongeBob:, Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy? ,[Sandy has a dazed look on her face], Right? I guess I'll eat one now. ,[reaches for a patty, but Sandy karate chops his arm with her green foam hand],
,Sandy:, You're mince meat!
,SpongeBob:, ,[in his red karate gear], In your dreams! Hi-yah! ,[both start to karate chop each other. Later, Mr. Krabs is walking through the park, carrying an umbrella],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? What the barnacle? ,[Everything in the park is chopped in half. Sandy is chopping wood while SpongeBob rests on a rock],
,SpongeBob:, Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[clearing his throat to get SpongeBob's attention],  Bleuhahugh!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Mr. Krabs! ,[tries to hold a tree back in one piece], Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going? ,[holds the rock in one piece], Nice day, huh? ,[half of the tree falls on SpongeBob's head], Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.
,Mr. Krabs:, Fire ya? ,[grabs a couple Krabby Patties], I've got something else in mind. ,[at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Sandy are karate chopping up Krabby Patties for the customers. Sandy is chopping up the meat and SpongeBob is chopping up the mustard],
,Sandy:, I love karate!
,SpongeBob:, I love kara-tay!
,Mr. Krabs:, I love money-ay! ,[He holds some money],
,Squidward:, I hate all of you.

"Squidward:, ,[hands Harold his tray of food], Here you go, sir. A King-Size Ultra Krabby Supreme with the works, double batter fried ,[puts a stick into the food], on a stick.
,Harold:, Thanks! ,[walks off],
,Squidward:, Barnaclehead. ,[Harold comes back],
,Harold:, Pardon me?
,Squidward:, ,[holds up a mayonnaise bottle], You forgot your mayonnaise. ,[sets it on Harold's tray],
,Harold:, Thanks. ,[walks off and sits at his table],
,Squidward:, Look at them eating that garbage. ,[Harold bites into his food and squirts mayonnaise into his mouth], It's ,disgusting,. They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughing from the kitchen window], Good one, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Good what?
,SpongeBob:, Like you don't know. ,[hits Squidward on the back of the head], Saying, ,[imitates Squidward], ""I hate Krabby Patties."" ,[normal voice], That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties.
,Squidward:, Yeah, well, not me.
,SpongeBob:, ,[silence, chuckles], You're good at that. ,[jumps on top of the window], Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha! ,[everyone laughs],
,Squidward:, Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts to grill more patties], Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say. ,[all the customers appear in the kitchen],
,All:, The only people who don't like a Krabby Patty, have never tasted one! ,[they all disappear],
,Squidward:, That's me. Never had one, never will. ,[SpongeBob flips a Krabby Patty through the ceiling of the Krusty Krab after hearing this],
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, ,What?,
,SpongeBob:, ,[cleans out his ears], What? What did you say?
,Squidward:, I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will.
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry... I don't...
,Squidward:, I've never had a Krabby Patty. ,[SpongeBob puts his glasses on and takes out a dictionary],
,SpongeBob:, Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?
,Squidward:, I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty!
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes off his glasses and throws away the dictionary], Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now! ,[runs out of the kitchen holding a Krabby Patty], No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this.
,Squidward:, ,[slaps the patty out of SpongeBob's hand], Get that garbage outta my face! ,[SpongeBob runs off and brings it back],
,SpongeBob:, If you try it, you'll love it!
,Squidward:, Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick. ,[pan over to Patrick dressed as a cowboy, standing next to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to Patrick, whispering], Sorry, Patrick. ,[Patrick sighs and walks off sadly. SpongeBob tries to give Squidward the patty again], Come on, you're gonna—
,Squidward:, ,[pushes the patty away], No.
,SpongeBob:, Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo... ,[Squidward slaps it away],
,Squidward:, No!
,SpongeBob:, ,[reaches behind Squidward's ear], Whoop! What's that in your ear? ,[pulls out a patty],
,Squidward:, Quit it.
,SpongeBob:, Come on, open wide!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first... ,[walks out from behind the counter], and not just the extra ones. ,[walks off as SpongeBob follows],
,SpongeBob:, But it's good for you!
,Squidward:, ,[turns around], G—good for you?! That thing is a heart attack on a bun!
,SpongeBob:, No, Squidward, I meant... good for your ,soul,. ,[background turns to a heaven-like sky and SpongeBob wearing wings and a halo and doves are seen flying in the background and a choir is heard],
,Squidward:, Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul! ,[background turns to fire, and flying bats and evil laughter is heard. Squidward walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, just half.
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, A quarter?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, One bite?
,Squidward:, No. ,[Squidward enters the bathroom. When he opens a stall door, SpongeBob shows him the patty],
,SpongeBob:, Just smell it.
,Squidward:, If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?! ,[slams the door. Cut to Squidward washing dishes. SpongeBob rises up, made with pink bubble in the sink, holding the Krabby Patty in his hand],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Squidward.
,Squidward:, No. ,[all the bubbles pop, including the Krabby Patty. Cut to Squidward putting money in the register. SpongeBob pops out of the register with coins on his head and eyes],
,SpongeBob:, One bite.
,Squidward:, No... ,[cash drawer shuts. Cut to Squidward taking out the trash. SpongeBob pops up from inside the trashcan, made with fruit and trash],
,SpongeBob:, You won't be sorry.
,Squidward:, ,[throws the garbage bag in the trash can], ,No,! ,[turns around and sees SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, It's delicious...
,Squidward:, Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up? ,[SpongeBob handcuffs himself to Squidward. Squidward takes the patty], Give me that! When I die...you stay away from my funeral. ,[looks at the patty, patty juice falls out], Ohh... do I really...
,SpongeBob:, Ahhhhh... ,[Squidward stretches his mouth], Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh... ,[Squidward takes a tiny bite of the Krabby Patty and smiles. SpongeBob's eyes turn into hearts],
,Squidward:, Why... this Krabby Patty may be the most... ,[suddenly angry], Horrible! Putrid! ,[SpongeBob's eyes turn into atomic explosions], Poorly prepared! Vile! Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!
,SpongeBob:, But—
,Squidward:, ,[throws the patty on the ground and stomps on it], And I curse this Krabby Patty, and all who enjoy them, to an early and well-deserved ,grave,! ,[puts a tombstone on top of the patty with 'R.I.P.' and a picture of a patty on it], Get it?
,SpongeBob:, But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. ,Nobody, is immune to its tasty charms.
,Squidward:, Nobody but me.
,SpongeBob:, Are you sure?
,Squidward:, Does this look unsure to you? ,[close-up of Squidward's wrinkly face],
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Squidward:, Good! Now go spread the word! ,[SpongeBob's eyes well up with tears as he walks back into the Krusty Krab. When he shuts the door, Squidward gasps and digs for the Krabby Patty], Come on! Come on! Come on! ,[holds up the Krabby Patty covered in sand], Ah... still alive! ,[shoves the whole thing in his mouth], Oh, soooo delicious! ,[cries], Oh...! All the wasted years...! ,[licks the ground], I gotta have more. I gotta have ,more,! ,[runs to the back of the Krusty Krab and is about to open the door, but doesn't], But wait! ,[stands by the window. His eyes float over to the side of his face looking at SpongeBob grilling], After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then... I'm off the stuff for ,good,!
,SpongeBob:, I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties. ,[flips one in the air. Squidward peaks through the window],
,Squidward:, Uhh, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Squidward?
,Squidward:, I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun, ,[gets more excited], with— with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?
,SpongeBob:, Coming right up! ,[flips the patties again], Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy. ,[Squidward moans and groans. His pupils flip as the patty does], But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old ,[indistinct. Squidward licks his lips], ...and they all don't have to like the same things. ,[the steam from the patties forms a figure and it kisses Squidward's nose then disappears],
,Squidward:, Don't go...
,SpongeBob:, ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it. ,[SpongeBob holds up the Krabby Patty. Squidward tries to take a bite, but SpongeBob takes it away and Squidward's face goes into the grill], You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite. ,[walks off. Squidward looks up with a burnt face. SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen], Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.
,Squidward:, Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.
,SpongeBob:, Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so... ,[eats the whole patty in one bite. Squidward gasps], Well, whoever they were, they had great taste! ,[Squidward groans and chatters, then starts to cry], Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work! ,[walks back into the kitchen],
,Squidward:, What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage? ,[Frank with a big belly walks up to the trash can with a partially eaten Krabby Patty],
,Frank:, I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full. Oh well. ,[drops the patty in the garbage],
,Squidward:, I had to say garbage... but, okay! ,[runs to the garbage can. Inhales deeply and eats everything in the garbage can. When he lifts up his head, the Krabby Patty is the only thing left in the garbage. He spits out what's in his mouth and grabs the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob runs over and grabs it out of his hand],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated! ,[runs to the furnace and throws it in and cries. Squidward walks up], I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came. ,[runs off as Squidward starts crying. Cut to nighttime where Squidward is sitting in his chair, still crying, when there is a knock on the door. Squidward answers it and it's a giant Krabby Patty. Squidward kisses it and sighs. Cut to Squidward having dinner with the patty, marrying the patty [where Nat Peterson talks inaudibly], having a child with the patty, and growing old with it. Dream sequence ends],
,Squidward:, Hmm, honey...? ,[wakes up], What? Oh... I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me! ,[runs out of his house, panting, but tiptoes past SpongeBob's house, then pants some more to the Krusty Krab, putting his face up against the door], There it is... unguarded! All I have to do is... Wait... It's ,too, easy. There must be some kind of... ,[Squidward sees dripping coming from above the door inside], security? ,[Squidward looks up and notices a bucket], This is our burglar alarm? A bucket of water? Ha-ha. ,[Squidward walks in, knocking the bucket off the door], That was ,too, easy. ,[sniffs], Hey, this isn't water, this is...gas! ,[A robotic arm with a match drops it, lighting a screaming Squidward on fire, who runs all the way into the kitchen, where another bucket of gas falls on him and fire is seen again, as he screams again. And then he walks up to the Patty Vault, wide-eyed, and opens the door to reveal hundreds and hundreds of Krabby Patties],
,Squidward:, Holy shrimp! I don't know where to start. ,[picks up a patty], All that matters is that it's just you... and me... and nobody...
,SpongeBob:, Squidward? ,[Squidward's face drops], Is that you?
,Squidward:, ,[turns around], SpongeBob? Uh, uh, uh... what are you doing here? ,[points at SpongeBob. While pointing at him, he notices he's showing the patty in his hand and puts it behind his back again],
,SpongeBob:, I always come to work at 3:00 A.M. This is when I count the sesame seeds. ,[takes off his green hat], What are you doing here?
,Squidward:, Uhh, I forgot my...
,SpongeBob:, And why is the patty vault open?
,Squidward:, Oh, I thought that...
,SpongeBob:, And why are you holding a patty behind your back?
,Squidward:, I... I... I... no, I didn't do...
,SpongeBob:, And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And... ,[grins],
,Squidward:, No, no, wait... it's not what you think. Th-this is a big misunderstanding. You've got to believe me, I... Listen, I am telling you... ,[jumps up and down], You better listen to me, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward? ,[Squidward begins to sweat, then slams the door on SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob! I ,love, Krabby Patties! ,[eats two patties],
,SpongeBob:, I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty! ,[Squidward eats a bunch of Krabby Patties in all sorts of ways, even a dozen at a time], Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward! ,[Squidward keeps eating all the Krabby Patties in the vault, Pac-Man style], Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward! ,[As soon as he ate dozens of Krabby Patties],
,Squidward:, What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?
,SpongeBob:, No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs...!
,Squidward:, My thighs? ,[pan down showing Squidward's enlarged thighs, he looks at thighs],
,SpongeBob:, ...and then you'll blow up! ,[Krusty Krab explodes. Squidward's head is sitting on the ambulance's bench while his legs are in a bucket],
,Joe:, ,[laughs], Yeah, I remember my first Krabby Patty.

"[Opens in on a bunch of jellyfish and one flying out of the field towards SpongeBob's block],
,Narrator:, Ah, ze early morning in Bikini Bottom, when the jellyfish are buzzing about and making their jellyfish jelly. ,[A jellyfish flies by SpongeBob's house. Just then a giant periscope comes out of the porthole], Oh, what is happening here? ,[SpongeBob is looking through the periscope from inside, Patrick waits behind him], Collectors? ,[SpongeBob nods to Patrick. They both run toward two vents: one square shaped, one circular shaped. SpongeBob takes the square one and Patrick takes the circle one. The two approach ropes and slide down them. At the bottom, they encounter a case of rope burn and jump around frantically. They blow their hands to remove the burn. Once the burn is gone, the two get serious again and approach a closet. It houses three sets of poles and three sets of nets. SpongeBob and Patrick take one of each, connect them and test their mobility. SpongeBob puts on his glasses and the two seriously step out ready for action. A jellyfish flies by and the two joyfully sing and follow it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[off-screen], I think I've got it! Wait a minute... ,[we hear jellyfish stings and SpongeBob and Patrick screaming. The two run back the way they came, being chased by the jellyfish. They fall into a heap in front of Squidward's house. The jellyfish stings both of their backsides and flies off. Just then, Squidward comes out of his house with his bike],
,Squidward:, Hm.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, we're jellyfishing.
,Squidward:, Of course you are. Bye now. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Wait! We made a net especially for you! ,[holds it up], Do you want to come with us?
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Really? Jellyfishing with you guys? Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book! I would love to go jellyfishing! I can't think of anything I'd like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends: SpongeBob and... uh...
,Patrick:, Patrick.
,Squidward:, Right. But I can't. Bye bye.
,SpongeBob:, Next time?
,Squidward:, Oh sure, right! Whatever. ,[bikes away; under breath], Like that'll ever happen.
,SpongeBob:, You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun.
,Patrick:, Maybe he doesn't like us.
,SpongeBob:, No, are you kidding? We're his best friends. ,[Squidward bikes down a path, chuckling to himself],
,Squidward:, Jellyfishing. ,[as he laughs, his nose inflates and deflates], Oh, I'll go. ,[laughs], I sure had them going. ,[laughs. But, he doesn't see a jellyfish which is going in the opposite direction. He keeps on laughing. The jellyfish ends up swimming in Squidward's mouth and he coughs it out], Stupid jellyfish! Beat it! ,[He hits it, and the jellyfish goes up his shirt and starts zapping him, causing Squidward to veer out of control. His tentacles get tangled on the pedals and he trips on a rock. He bounces down a hill and then falls down a jagged rocky cliff. He reaches the bottom of the cliff and immediately an atomic explosion appears.], Ow...
,[Cut to SpongeBob sitting at his house. He looks out the window. But, no one is there. He sits down again. He notices a photo of him and an unhappy Squidward that reads, ""Friends."" He puts it down and looks out the window again. Squidward, who's in a wheelchair and all bandaged up rolls down the path],
,SpongeBob:, Squid's back! ,[he phones Patrick, which causes the screen to split diagonally, revealing Patrick on the bottom],
,Patrick:, Yello?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!
,Patrick:, Oh, great! Who are they? ,[it's revealed that the two are phoning each other from across the room, just with different wallpapers],
,SpongeBob:, Us! ,[the two hang up], Let's go! ,[Squidward wheels himself into his house. The lights suddenly turn on, and party horns can be heard. SpongeBob and Patrick are inside his house with a banner that says ""Welcome Home""], Welcome home, Squidward!
,Patrick:, Merry Christmas!
,SpongeBob:, We're gonna make this your best day ever! ,[Squidward turns around and wheels out. SpongeBob rolls him back in], Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there. ,[SpongeBob wheels Squidward to a table where Patrick stands by a bowl of soup],
,Patrick:, How about some soup on your best day ever? ,[Squidward looks at the soup and sees Alphabet Soup letters spelling out, ""Best Day Ever"" Patrick holds up a spoon], Here we go! ,[he scoops some up, but Squidward makes some grunting noises in refusal], Oh, it's a little hot. ,[he blows on the spoon, sending steaming hot soup splashing all over Squidward's bandaged face. Patrick notices his spoon is empty and refills it to blow on, covering Squidward in more hot soup. This continues for three times until SpongeBob pulls the soup bowl away and laughs nervously],
,SpongeBob:, I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever. ,[walks near a music stand and Squidward's clarinet], How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet. ,[he blows into it, but wind comes out causing Squidward to groan], Sorry, my lips are a little dry. ,[He wets his lips exaggeratedly long and wet. Just when he prepares to blow, a disgusted Patrick snatches the clarinet away],
,Patrick:, Music isn't best either!
,SpongeBob:, But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever ,the, best day ever! ,[cut to SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward in Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob and Patrick hold nets],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[chanting], Jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing!
,SpongeBob:, This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured. ,[Squidward rides away, but SpongeBob catches him], No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen.
,Patrick:, Firmly grasp it in your hand. ,[he places the pole end on Squidward's bandaged hand, but it falls because he can't grab, Patrick picks it up], Firmly grasp it. ,[he does it again and the results are the same. Patrick gets frustrated], ,Firmly grasp it!, ,[he forcefully jabs the net through Squidward's bandaged hand. Squidward lets out a muffled pained scream], That oughta do it. ,[SpongeBob spots a jellyfish],
,SpongeBob:, There's one in position. Ready... set... go! ,[the two yell out words of encouragement to Squidward and jump up and down, but Squidward isn't budging. The two eventually notice Squidward isn't going anywhere. They again encourage him, but still nothing happens],
,Patrick:, I think we gotta show him how it's done. ,[in the tune of ""The Beautiful Blue Danube,"" SpongeBob and Patrick dance along next to the jellyfish and try to catch it. SpongeBob and Patrick sing, and even the jellyfish hums out some music. After several attempts, they get into a big fight with stinging and such. The jellyfish escapes the squabbles and swims by Squidward and stings him on the nose. Squidward, mad, goes after the jellyfish. SpongeBob and Patrick, still getting stung by jellyfish, notice],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, look! Squid's doing it! ,[as Squidward chases, SpongeBob and Patrick cheer him on. His wheelchair is stopped by a rock, but he eventually gets back on track. The jellyfish lands on a pink ""rock"" and Squidward catches it. He laughs triumphantly, but muffled due to the bandages and whacks the net against the ""rock"". The ""rock"" surfaces, revealing to be a really huge jellyfish, the Queen Jellyfish. She now floats above Squidward. Squidward gulps. SpongeBob and Patrick look on.],
,Patrick:, This guy's good.
,SpongeBob:, He's a natural!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick start cheering Squidward on as he tries to get away from the Queen Jellyfish.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Simultaneously cheering], Yeah, you're doing great! Go, Squid, go!
,Patrick:, ,[Simultaneously cheering], Yeah, you got it, Squidward! Yeah, you're doing it, Squid! See what you've been missing?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Simultaneously cheering], Yeah, you got, Squid!
,Patrick:, ,[Simultaneously cheering], You got what you wanted, Squidward! You can go that distance! Use that net!
,SpongeBob:, Be the net!
,Patrick:, Yeah! You're feeling it, Squid! That's it, all the way! The last 6 miles, make that, Squid! Go, go, go!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Simultaneously], Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now!
,Patrick:, It's in the bag!
,SpongeBob:, This is really your best day ever, isn't it?
,[The Queen Jellyfish gives Squidward an extremely powerful sting. SpongeBob and Patrick stop cheering.],
,Both:,  Oooh...
,[Cut to the next day where SpongeBob and Patrick walking in front of Squidward's place covered in bandages],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick. Well... ,[sighs], Thought yesterday went... ,[hesitates], pretty well, don't you think?
,Patrick:, I had fun.
,SpongeBob:, Me too. ,[some whirring is heard in the background],
,Patrick:, Here comes Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, great. ,[Squidward approaches in a stretcher], Hey, Squid! How about that... ,[Squidward rolls down the front walk in a wheeled medical bed with a container of life-saving fluid and in a full body cast.], ...best day ever?
,Patrick:, There's always tomorrow! ,[Squidward's bed bangs on the door, trying to get in],
,SpongeBob:, Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward. ,[he bangs the door again], Um, we got you a present! ,[it's the jellyfish that caused Squidward to encounter the Queen Jellyfish in a jar], It's the jellyfish. ,[Squidward scowls],
,Patrick:, You know, from yesterday!
,SpongeBob:, You're not still mad, are you? ,[Squidward opens the jar in SpongeBob and Patrick's direction],
,Patrick:, Yup, he's still mad. ,[The jellyfish chases after SpongeBob and Patrick and stings them repeatedly as they run into the distance screaming. Squidward laughs to himself, his nose inflating and deflating again. The Queen Jellyfish returns and zaps him again. Now he's burnt to a crisp. The cast cracks off in pieces, leaving a completely blackened Squidward],

,SpongeBob:, Safety first. ,[SpongeBob captures a jellyfish], A-ha! I finally gotcha! ,[SpongeBob grabs a wooden stool and sits on it. Puts on a farmer hat and 'milks' the jellyfish. Jelly comes out and squirts on a piece of bread. The jellyfish moos like a cow. He eats.], Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later! ,[walks off but jellyfish floats towards him with his glasses], Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye! ,[the jellyfish floats with SpongeBob], I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home. ,[jellyfish hangs onto SpongeBob's nose], No. You can't go home with me. ,[jellyfish walks behind him. The jellyfish's steps are squeaking, like SpongeBob's], Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey! ,[puts the jellyfish on a rock], Stay! ,[walks backwards], Stay... ,[jellyfish floats around SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs the jellyfish and uses a slingshot to launch him somewhere else but the jellyfish ends up on his back. The jellyfish giggles. SpongeBob pulls the jellyfish off], [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me! ,[SpongeBob looks at the jellyfish sternly. The jellyfish deflates as if he was sad. SpongeBob decides to keep him], Ahh, what the heck! ,[SpongeBob, with the jellyfish on a rope, like a dog, walk by Squidward's house], Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard! ,[Squidward peeks out his window], Squidward! Look at my new pet!
,Squidward:, That's no pet, that's a wild animal.
,SpongeBob:, No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch! ,[throws a stick so the jellyfish returns it. SpongeBob is holding up three fingers], How many fingers am I holding up? ,[the jellyfish hums deeply three times], Play dead! ,[jellyfish is buried underground with a tomb that says ""R.I.P."". He pops up],
,Squidward:, I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained! ,[the jellyfish, still on the rope, is on a toilet reading a newspaper as he hums casually], I didn't need to see that.
,SpongeBob:, Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
,Squidward:, How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish? ,[SpongeBob and the jellyfish dance to some music. Also, various colors change as they dance. Disco lights rotate around the room. SpongeBob's house is vibrating from the music], SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... for twelve hours!
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops dancing. He is exhausted, sees the jellyfish dance more], Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed. ,[as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on], Huh? ,[walks over to turn the music off], You got it all wrong, little fella. ,[as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on. SpongeBob turns it back off], Bed. Repeat after me. ,[SpongeBob ties the rope around the jellyfish], Bed! ,[upstairs, SpongeBob ties the rope around his bedpost], We'll just keep you right here.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody. ,[as he is sleeping throughout the night, other jellyfish float inside the pineapple],
,Gary:, Meow. ,[jellyfish opens the window, and the 4 jellyfish talking in jellyfish speaking], Meow. ,[gets squirted with jelly from all the jellyfish, they laugh at Gary, and continue squirting jelly on him], Meow. ,[More jellyfish enter SpongeBob's House. It's now daytime],
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! ,[puts on his green robe and goes to check downstairs],
,Gary:, ,[Follows SpongeBob to the doorway], Meow.
,SpongeBob:,  Oh, jellyfi-! ,[slips on some jelly. Opens a door leading into his living room and sees jellyfish dancing to music. The jellyfish are having a dance party.], Where'd you all come from? ,[jellyfish form a figure of a hand and the hand grabs SpongeBob. They stick over a light bulb like a disco ball and spin him. Then falls to the ground], Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome. ,[As SpongeBob is walking to the stereo, jellyfish form a flight of stairs that SpongeBob walks up and falls off of], This music is way too loud. ,[jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a triangle], Very funny. ,[jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a rectangle], I'm serious! ,[Jellyfish carry SpongeBob up and down the screen. The scene then goes to SpongeBob's house bouncing up and down because of the loud party. Squidward's house. Squidward is still lying in his bed, holding a pillow against his face. He has not slept all night.],
,Squidward:, Grr! Eighteen hours! ,[falls off his bed, picks up the phone and dials SpongeBob's number], I'm gonna give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!
,Jellyfish:, ,[Cut back to the party. Jellyfish picks up the phone. ], ,[garbled], Hello?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears! I've had enough of this! ,[Jelly squirts through the phone and onto Squidward's face], Strawberry. ,[Squidward plays his clarinet outside his window], Two can play at this! ,[plays his clarinet badly. Jellyfish form a smiley face.],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, guys, enough is enough! ,[SpongeBob hears the clarinet music in the distance.] Huh? [Cuts back to the Jellyfish's smile, but this time, turns into an angry frown when Squidward plays his clarinet], Uh-oh!,[Jellyfish sting SpongeBob], Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him! ,[SpongeBob peeks his head out his window], Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
,Squidward:, The jellyfish don't like...? ,[sarcastically], Why, sure, pal, I can play better.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, he said he'll play better. ,[Squidward's house rotates slowly towards SpongeBob's house. He has a giant amp set behind him. In front of him is a microphone. Squidward inhales deeply as his house stretches, then he plays his clarinet extremely loudly.], Uh-oh! That's not better! ,[Jellyfish knocks SpongeBob's coral plant over], Hey! Take it easy with that! ,[The jellyfish knock over his television], Those are my things! ,[The jellyfish knock over a wall decoration], Don't break th- Dow! ,[The jellyfish float out of the party and into Squidward's house],
,Squidward:,  Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down. Ow! Ow! Ow! ,[the jellyfish sting Squidward and float back into SpongeBob's house, returning to their party. A welt-covered Squidward walks up to the door and gives SpongeBob his clarinet], Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, now, that wasn't nice! ,[jellyfish take the clarinet and snap it in half. A fire forms and they dance around it in a circle. Boat horn toots as SpongeBob finally reaches his breaking point.], Okay, that is it! Everybody out! ,[He grabs the stereo and runs toward the door but the jellyfish try to take it back so they can party more. Both sides accidentally let go and the stereo falls to floor and shatters into pieces with a crash causing the music to stop. SpongeBob gulps and the jellyfish start to quiver, due to the loss of the music, thus ending their party. SpongeBob stammers. The jellyfish get angry and sting SpongeBob], Come on, Gary! ,[SpongeBob and Gary head up to the roof. SpongeBob's house vibrates forcefully, and the jellyfish start to swarm around the house.], Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in. ,[SpongeBob looks scared and his teeth chatter. Gary clicks his eyes together making a beat that the jellyfish can dance to], Huh? They stopped? ,[holds Gary's eyes together and the jellyfish get angry again. Then he lets go of Gary's eyes and they dance again. Does this a couple more times and notices a trend], Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it! ,[takes Gary to Jellyfish Fields. Along the way, SpongeBob has other creatures and things join in the rhythm. Eventually, he gets the jellyfish back home to Jellyfish Fields and he runs back to his home],
,Narrator:, Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea's harshest lessons: wild animals can throw very wild parties. ,[SpongeBob shakes Gary's eye, congratulating him. Squidward sinks down into his bubble bath as he groans in pain], Ooh, I felt that.

I'm gonna call you ""Twelvey."" ,[tickles it with a feather], Coochie coochie coo! ,[it sneezes out some jelly], Bye, Twelvey! ,[Twelvey stings him as it says goodbye and flies away. He sees a blue jellyfish], Oh! It's you! ,[He mimics the jellyfish's style of floating, then tries to catch the blue jellyfish, but fails], Well, it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name.

,Mr. Krabs:, Come with me, boyo. ,[grabs SpongeBob and drags him into the freezer],
,[The freezer closes its door and, like an elevator, it takes them downstairs into the basement where Mr. Krabs built a secret laboratory underneath his restaurant.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! What is this place?
,Mr. Krabs:, It's me secret lab where I experiment on food.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs, this looks like madness.
,Mr. Krabs:, You think this is mad? Ooh, wait 'till you see...,[pulls a curtain and reveals a large magnifying glass with large eye looking through], this!
,SpongeBob:, Yipe!
,[The large eye turned out to be Sandy.],
,Sandy:, Howdy, SpongeBob! ,[pushes the magnifying glass up],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy? What are you doing down here?
,Sandy:, I'm moonlighting as a molecular gastronomist.
,SpongeBob:, What? A maladowin-a-gas-a-whatalist?
,Sandy:, ,[pulls down a diagram of an algebraic expression that includes a burger, French fries, a double-helix, and the pi symbol], Eugene here is paying me to science up his menu.
,Mr. Krabs:, Look, I'm in a hurry. You have this special project.
,Sandy:, Well, it's a work in process.
,[Sandy grabs a pipette and squeezes a drop of a red liquid, into a container. Red liquid grows into a double-helix shape, and forms a red floating, glowing Krabby Patty.],
,Sandy:, There it is! Your new patty!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hm.
,SpongeBob:, Wait, no! You can't improve the Krabby Patty! It's perfect perfection that cannot be perfected upon! ,[puts normal Krabby Patty on top of red glowing Krabby Patty],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, right. Sensitive to time. ,[pushes the normal Krabby Patty in SpongeBob's head], Make me 200 of these, pronto!
,[The scene changes back into the dining room.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Here you go, gentlemen. Two brand new patties. ,[serves the hipster fish the Secret Patties],
,Hipster fish #1 & #2:, Hmm. Huh? ,[they eat the new Secret Patties],
,Sandy:, ,[comes out with a load of secret patties in a cart], Step right up and get your new, improved patties!
,[The customers pile up on top of Sandy and they each get the Secret Patty.],
,Sandy:, ,[feels dizzy], Ah! Uh.
,French Narrator:, Many Secret Patties Later...
,Hipster fish #2:, ,[texting on his phone], I'm leaving a good review.
,Customer:, ,[full from eating the secret patties], So tasty.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[eats the Secret Patty], Hm. A little bit different, but they taste familiar. ,[eats the Secret Patty whole; he burps and feels sick], Well, that wasn't familiar. ,[burps],
,SpongeBob:, You feeling okay? 'Cause there's sesame seeds growing out of your back.
,[Mr. Krabs groans as sesame seeds grow out of his back. His head mutates into a bun. His torso becomes a patty with lettuce. His claws grow out of the top bun. Two crab feet grow out of the bottom bun. Mr. Krabs has completely turned into a Krabby Patty zombie monster and he moans like a zombie.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[horrified], What's going on?
,Sandy:, ,[feels sick], Ooh. Ehh, I never shoulda eaten four. ,[feels something growing in her], Uh! Ah! ,[her head becomes a bun], Huh! ,[her hands grow bigger and her entire body inside her suit mutates into a Krabby Patty zombie; she growls],
,SpongeBob:, The new patties! They're making everyone change!
,[Soon, all of the customers, who ate the Secret Patty, mutate into Krabby Patty zombies.],
,Squidward:, ,[mutates into a Krabby Patty zombie monster], Uh! Oh! ,[groans],
,SpongeBob:, I gotta get out of here! Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah! ,[retreats into the kitchen],
,Dave:, Maybe I'll pass on this patty. ,[throws the Secret Patty in the trashcan],
,Krabby Patty Zombie #1:, Try this! ,[grabs part of his body and stuffs it into Dave's mouth and forces it down his throat],
,Dave:, ,[feels sick], Ohh! ,[mutates into a Krabby Patty zombie], Bite my buns.
,[The Krabby Patty zombies march out of the Krusty Krab and begin to wreak havoc across Bikini Bottom. Norton is seen whistling until he bumps into a Krabby Patty zombie.],
,Norton:, Ooh! ,[goes to touch the Krabby Patty zombie, but it comes to life],
,Krabby Patty Zombie #2:, Eat us!
,Norton:, Ahh! ,[the Krabby Patty zombie leaps into his throat and they both fuse into one zombie],
,Both:, Eat us!
,[Officer Rob is resting in his police car.],
,Radio Dispatcher:, Car 521, we have an outbreak on rabid patties.
,Officer Rob:, Yeah, yeah. I'm on my break.
,[Three Krabby Patty zombies appear and start attacking Officer Rob's police car.],
,Officer Rob:, Go ahead! Come on, I'm on my break!
,[Patrick is seen eating an ice cream cone as Krabby Patty zombies sneak up behind him.],
,Krabby Patty Zombies:, Eat us!
,[Patrick eats one of the zombified hipster fish. The zombified hipster fish moans and leaves. Patrick then mutates into a Krabby Patty zombie.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Eat me. ,[gets stopped by Bubble Bass],
,Bubble Bass:, Really, Krabs? Is this some kind of new promotional gimmick? Surely, you can do better than this, Eugene. I mean, ,[takes out a pickle from Mr. Krabs' zombified body], you even wasted real pickles on this cheap costume? ,[eats the pickle], Pretty insulting, if you ask me. ,[mutates into a giant Krabby Patty zombie and roars],
,Mr. Krabs:, Eat us.
,[Several Krabby Patty zombies shake the Krusty Krab sign where Debbie Rechid and her children are hiding.],
,Ryan:, Ohh, whoa! Whoa, whoa! ,[falls off],
,Debbie Rechid:, Ryan!
,Krabby Patty Zombie #2:, ,[grabs part of his body], Uhh, ah! Open wide!
,Ryan:, No.
,Elderly Krabby Patty Zombie:, Here comes the choo-choo.
,Ryan:, No! Uhh—,[eats a part of the zombie], Mm, mm, mmm! That's not so bad. ,[mutates into a Krabby Patty zombie],
,[Back inside the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is hiding in the kitchen.],
,SpongeBob:, All original Krabby Patty, why did we forsake your perfect recipe? ,[gets grabbed in the head by Sandy], Ohh. ,[screams and Sandy lets go of him],
,Sandy:, Chow down, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Um, no thanks. ,[eats the normal Krabby Patty], Already ate. See?
,[Sandy becomes angry and breaks through the window. SpongeBob screams and climbs out of the window to escape. Then he climbs into the dumpster to take refuge.],
,SpongeBob:, Maybe I'll be safe in here till all this blows over.
,French Narrator:, Moments Later...
,[Bikini Bottom is completely burned down from the Krabby Patty zombie invasion.],
,Perch Perkins:, This is Perch Perkins reporting live from the Krusty Krab, where I am one of the three people still unaffected by this rabid patty pandemonium. The second unaffected person is in this dumpster. Care to comment, sir, on the chaos?
,SpongeBob:, ,[comes out], Perch Perkins, how did you know I was in here?
,Perch Perkins:, I was napping in this dumpster when you snuck in, seeking refuge.
,Squidward:, Take a bite! ,[grabs part of his body and attacks Perch Perkins],
,Perch Perkins:, No! No!
,SpongeBob:, Wait! Who's the third person not affected?
,Perch Perkins:, P—P—P—P—P—...,[gets some of Squidward's Krabby Patty body shoved into his mouth and speaks through his air bubble], Plankton! ,[struggles as he mutates into a Krabby Patty zombie],
,SpongeBob:, Plankton. The Chum Bucket! ,[runs out],
,Squidward and Perch Perkins:, Eat us!
,Krabby Patty Zombies:, Eat us!
,[SpongeBob runs to the Chum Bucket, pushing an elderly Krabby Patty zombie in the process. Inside the Chum Bucket, Plankton is stacking bags of chum.],
,Plankton:, There it is, Karen. 152 bags of Grade B pre-cooked chum and not a single customer's come through that door.
,[SpongeBob bolts in through the front doors and barricades it with boards and nails.],
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, what are you doing? How are the customers supposed to get in now?
,SpongeBob:, Those aren't customers out there, Plankton. They're all Krabby Patty zombie monsters! And they're forcing everybody to eat them! You and I are the last two survivors!
,Plankton:, Krabby Patty zombies? Heh. I'll believe it when I see it.
,[Suddenly, the Krabby Patty zombie break through the boards and they gather around the Chum Bucket.],
,Plankton:, Okay, I believe it!
,[The Krabby Patty zombies break through the front door and enter inside.],
,Plankton:, Karen!
,[The Krabby Patty zombies stuff some of their bodies into Karen's hard drive and her screen turns into a Krabby Patty.],
,Karen:, ,[whirring], Consume me.
,Plankton:, No! ,[gets grabbed by a zombified Mrs. Puff], Hey!
,Mrs. Puff:, Have some.
,Plankton:, No! Wait! I don't want— ,[Mrs. Puff rubs him on her zombified body and he mutates into a Krabby Patty zombie; she sets him down], Have a slider.
,[SpongeBob is now the last remaining survivor as the Krabby Patty zombies surround him. He tries to find something to defend himself but he sees two forks-like spoons.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! ,[grabs the spoons], Stay back! I've got sporks!
,[The Krabby Patty zombies stop and look at each other in confusion. They resume closing in on SpongeBob. SpongeBob uses the spoons the climb on the bags on chum to get away. The spoons rip one bag open, causing some chum to fall out and land in Patrick's mouth. Patrick eats the chum and he spits the Secret Patty out, reverting him back to normal.],
,Patrick:, Boy, do I feel better!
,[SpongeBob looks down in confusion, but realizes that chum is the antidote to the Secret Patty's effects.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's it! Chum is the cure.
,Patrick:, Oh, a patty. ,[eats the Secret Patty and changes back into his Krabby Patty zombie form],
,SpongeBob:, ,[annoyed], Patrick!
,Krabby Patty Zombies:, Eat us!
,SpongeBob:, No, eat chum. Wah! ,[punctures open a bag to let chum fall out],
,[The chum falls into the mouth of one of the hipster fish. He eats it, vomits out the Secret Patty, and returns to his normal self.],
,Hipster fish #2:, What happened?
,SpongeBob:, ,[scoops chum down to the Krabby Patty zombies], Yes! Yes!
,[Mrs. Puff and another zombie eat the chum. Squidward, Bubble Bass and another zombie also eat the chum. One elderly zombie tries to eat some chum, but gets pushed out of the way by another zombie. SpongeBob continues to throw chum down onto the Krabby Patty zombies as Plankton gets covered with it in the process. SpongeBob climbs all the way to the top and looks down at the Krabby Patty zombies.],
,SpongeBob:, Maybe I should up the dosage! ,[rips open a bag and shoots down chum], Ahh! ,[he shoots chum into the mouths of the last remaining zombies including Perch Perkins and Sandy], And three, two—
,[All of the Krabby Patty zombies spit out the secret patties and return to their normal selves. But in the process, they all become sick to the stomach after what had happened to them.],
,Squidward:, Oh, my cranium.
,Bubble Bass:, Ehh, I told myself I'd never eat here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh boy, so much for lab-grown patties.
,SpongeBob:, You see, Mr. Krabs, some things don't need scientific reengineering to be delicious. ,[draws and forms a Krabby Patty in midair], The original Krabby Patty is perfect just the way it is.
,Hipster fish #2:, Yeah, you know, after all that, a good, old vintage Krabby Patty sounds pretty good right now.
,Hipster fish #1:, Yeah. Vintage Krabby Patties rule!
,Mr. Krabs:, You're darn tootin', they do! And for the next three minutes, all vintage Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab are...double the price!
,[Everyone runs out of the Chum Bucket and heads back to the Krusty Krab.],
,Plankton:, Wait! Don't leave now! Who's gonna clean up this mess?!
,[The screen is about to close until the Krabby Patty zombified Patrick stops it.],
,Patrick:, Uhh! ,[grabs part of his body including his right eye], Have some. ,[laughs as the screen turns black],

"SpongeBob:, ,[reads the newspaper while sipping some coffee], Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
,Gary:, ,[sitting at the counter], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts on his hat], Well, time to punch that clock.,[walks into his living room], But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.,[calendar reads ""June 21""], You are a winner.,[hugs himself then looks back at the calendar and gasps],And today's the first day of summer!,[cut to the Krusty Krab where the bored Squidward is at the register. SpongeBob walks through the doors with a pink flower around his head. He tosses flower petals into the air],Happy first day of summer, Squidward!,[walks over to Squidward], Care to join me for solstice caroling?,[sings in a high voice],Walking in the grass,,it's so fine,,don't need shoes,in the summertime!,[tosses flower petals at Squidward],
,Squidward:, I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[does a few back flips in the air], Whee-hoo! ,[runs over to the window],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up to him], Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever! ,[turns around], What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
,Mr. Krabs:, The money!
,SpongeBob:, The money?
,Mr. Krabs:, Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!
,SpongeBob:, Oh.
,Mr. Krabs:, You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break. ,[sits down on a barrel and SpongeBob sits on his lap],
,SpongeBob:, Tell me more about summer break. ,[a school bell rings and all the kids run out of the school],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance. ,[a child runs by with a full pocket of coins], Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever. ,[pulls down a menu], I guess that's what I like best. ,[puts a sticker labeled '4.99' next to the Kiddie Meal], Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal. ,[goes over to the front window], Come here, you little piggies!
,SpongeBob:, I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
,Narrator:, Later... ,[Mr. Krabs is still standing at the window with the same expression on his face],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up], Almost closing time, Mr. K.
,Mr. Krabs:, What? But that's impossible. ,[sobs], What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children? ,[SpongeBob shrugs as Mr. Krabs sighs], I guess summer isn't coming this year.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. ,[points at a playground where kids are playing],
,Mr. Krabs:, Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. ,[cut to the playground. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs pull up in their boat. They peek out using a pair of binoculars],
,SpongeBob:, See anything, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob. ,[two kids are swinging], So weak and malnourished. ,[one of the kids is eating a lollipop], With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing. ,[a kid slides down a slide], Breaks me heart. ,[cries], No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
,Mr. Krabs:, True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. ,[drives off],
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey! ,[cut to SpongeBob walking to the Krusty Krab], Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment. ,[stares at something in the distance], Huh? ,[a group of kids are lined up at the Krusty Krab where a sign reads ""Krabby Land"" is hanging. A giant sheet is covering some sort of area. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! ,[sticks the hammer in his belt], You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!
,SpongeBob:, Krabby Land, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, Krabby Land! ,[holds up a sign], Where a kid can have fun... for the right price. ,[laughs], Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?
,Monroe:, Monroe.
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice to meet you, Monroe. ,[picks him up and laughs],
,Monroe:, Whee!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shakes Monroe and hears change in his pocket], Mmm... a-ha! ,[his pupils become dollar signs], Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land! ,[the kids cheer], Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
,Kids:, We promise.
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! [,pulls off the sheet that covered the play area,]
,Kids:, Yeah! ,[kids' cheers soon turn into frowns and shocked expressions. The play area is a bunch of cheap rides that break down. Tyler tries a slide but it collapses as he tries it],
,Tyler:, Whoa! Ooh, where am I?
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability waivers! ,[holds up a stack of paper], Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!
,Kids:, Yay!
,Mr. Krabs:, Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties. ,[holds up a Krabby Patty], Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.
,Kids:, We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!
,SpongeBob:, ,[while kids are chanting ""We want Krabby"" eight times], Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
,SpongeBob:, Stall 'em? How do I do that?
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know. Be entertaining. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around and sees the kids, angry; he laughs nervously and waves], Hey, kids!
,Monroe:, You're not Krabby the Clown.
,SpongeBob:, No, I'm not. I'm, uh... ,[puts on a mask], I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
,Tyler:, Lame.
,SpongeBob:, Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? ,[picks up a bubble wand],
,Monroe:, No.
,SpongeBob:, Well, you've never seen my bubbles. ,[blows a jellyfish bubble], Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
,Tyler:, Still lame. ,[bubble pops],
,SpongeBob:, ,[dips wand again], Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins. ,[blows a seahorse bubble], Ta-da! ,[Tyler pops the bubble], Uh... huh.
,Kids:, You stink! Bring on the clown!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, uh... and now for a finale! ,[starts blowing a bubble], Oops.
,Kids:, Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
,SpongeBob:, ,[the bubble pops in his eyes making it red. He screams], My eyes! ,[scream and trips over a barrel], Whoa! ,[crashes into The Pit of Doom which is actually a dumpster then swings over a tire. Lands in a pool of bowling balls then the tire lands on him. Kids start to laugh SpongeBob then begins to think...], ,[Inner Monologue], They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery. ,[Normal speech], Hey, kids, check this out. ,[picks up his bubble wand and dips it in the bubble soap then throws the wand away. Pours all the bubble soap in his eyes which swell up and he screams],
,Kids:, Woo-hoo!
,SpongeBob:, I got 'em right where I want 'em. ,[SpongeBob puts a piece of tape on his face and rips it off, revealing a portion of his face is missing and he screams],
,Kids:, Woo-hoo! Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, ,[lies on the ground with his tongue sticking out. A truck runs over his tongue over and over and he screams],
,Kids:, Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha! ,[SpongeBob walks up to a muscular guy and hands him some money. The muscular guy hits him with a big hammer. SpongeBob gives the thumbs up], Yeah, woo! ,[muscular guy smashes SpongeBob with a wrecking ball], Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob gives a thumbs-up. Later, SpongeBob is tied to two poles with a muscular guy holding a can of lima beans; screams as muscular guy shoves a spoonful of lima beans in SpongeBob’s mouth. All the kids cheer],
,Kids:, ,[laughing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[being used as a ball in the two muscular guys' ping pong game], Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
,Kids:, Yay! ,[SpongeBob’s arms are getting stretched by two muscular guys], Yeah! ,[SpongeBob is in two pieces but gives two thumbs up. Cut to Mr. Krabs' office where he is counting the money he has received from the kids. SpongeBob enters his office in pieces],
,SpongeBob:, Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
,Mr. Krabs:, Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
,SpongeBob:, The kids are using them as... boomerangs. ,[one of SpongeBob’s legs flies in and back out],
,Mr. Krabs:, Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
,SpongeBob:, What are we gonna do?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
,SpongeBob:, ,[hops on top of the table], Really? He's here? ,[bounces up and down], Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Get out there and tell 'em!
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks outside], Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
,Kids:, Yay!
,SpongeBob:, Who do you want?
,Kids:, Krabby!
,SpongeBob:, When do you want him?
,Kids:, Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby! ,[all running up to Mr. Krabs], Krabby! Hooray!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
,Kids and SpongeBob:, Yay!
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, here you go! ,[turns around with a blue nose and tie on], Hey, kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties! ,[laughs and walks back toward his office, leaving the children including SpongeBob puzzled], Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
,SpongeBob:, I'll say you have.
,Mr. Krabs,[turns around], SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[frowning], How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, I ain't cheap! ,[takes off his fake nose and rubs the blue paint off it], Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
,SpongeBob:, But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks to the window], The children? I don't care about the children! ,[starts to climb out the window], I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose! ,[climbs out], Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. ,[laughs],
,Kid:, Ahem.
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[angry children are standing behind him], Oh, hey kids. ,[smiles nervously], Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
,Monroe:, Get him! ,[all the kids run after him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[inside, sounds of Mr. Krabs getting beat up by the kids is heard as SpongeBob sighs], I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.
,Squidward:, You mean this morning?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. ,[a noise is heard outside],
,Monroe:, Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!
,Kids:, ,[money is falling from the sky], Yay! Hooray!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.
,Kids:, Hooray! ,[a kid on top of the Krusty Krab is throwing money down],
,SpongeBob:, Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[is tied to poles like SpongeBob was earlier], Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff! ,[a muscular guy places a spoon of lima beans in front of him], No! Not that green stuff! ,[a lima bean truck backs up], Noooooooooo!

,Dan Povenmire:, ,[screaming while being chased by a giant robot],
,SpongeBob:, Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob lying in his bed, whimpering and shivering], What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? ,[Gary is sleeping], Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? ,[pokes Gary's eye, causing him to wake up],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. ,[goes to sleep. Dreams about running from the giant robot from the movie earlier.

,Mr. Krabs:, How about a little music to count me money to? ,[turns on the radio that is next to him],
,Radio DJ:,  ,[From the radio], And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: ,""Electric Zoo."", ,[techno beat is heard. Mr. Krabs starts counting his money],

,SpongeBob:, #17 -- ,[holds up a tray with food], Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Hilarious. Just deliver the food.

,SpongeBob:, Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... ,[scene zooms in on him], ...a robot? Nah. ,[peeks into the window again and sees Mr. Krabs doing a robot dance on his desk. He jumps onto Squidward's arms], Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!
,Squidward:, ,[picks up SpongeBob off his arms], That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen! ,[throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it],
,SpongeBob:, I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.
,Squidward:, ,[confused], How did you...?
,SpongeBob:, Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs up to the counter], What is it, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?
,Squidward:, Umm... yeah, sure.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, let's hear it, lad.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[chuckles nervously], Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?
,Mr. Krabs:, Why?
,Squidward:, It was rated ""Arr!"",[laughing], Arr! Because it's... about... pirates.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... ,[scene zooms in on him], ...a robot!
,Squidward:, There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs up to the counter again], What? What is it, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? ,[pretends to cry],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!
,SpongeBob:, Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!
,SpongeBob:, That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love.
,Squidward:, No, wait, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs up to the counter again], What is it, SpongeBob?!
,SpongeBob:, I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! ,[Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face],
,Mr. Krabs:, Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gulps], Squidward? ,[Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something when the radio stops working. Radio breaks with electronic breakage sound effect.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Aw, me radio died! ,[takes out the batteries], Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. ,[puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water], Me hard-boiled egg is ready! ,[picks up a pair of tongs], I can already taste it. Come to Papa. ,[takes the egg out of the water with his tongs], Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? ,[picks up a pinch of salt],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes], Ahhh! Oh, my eyes! ,[starts screaming],
,SpongeBob:, Mr... ,[Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth],
,Squidward:, Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?
,SpongeBob:, Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.
,Squidward:, Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look ,anything, like that?!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Barges out screaming; his eyes are piercing red, his pair of the tongs snip, then it shows the batteries in his pocket],
,SpongeBob & Squidward:, ,[both screaming],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom],
,Squidward:, I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs over to the phone], Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!
,Operator:, Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!
,Squidward:, Not the Navy! ,[over loudspeaker], Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! ,[everyone is silent], Our world! ,[all the customers run out screaming], What do we do now?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know! ,[notices a nickel], Hey, a nickel! ,[he points at it],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal], Ah, that's better. ,[walks back to his office], Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.
,Squidward:, We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?
,SpongeBob:, Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.
,Squidward:, They poop on the robot?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.
,Squidward:, I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! ,[grabs the book titled ,How To Torture, and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob & Squidward enter],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, hello, boys. ,[they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces], What can I do for you? ,[SpongeBob & Squidward lock the door], Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? ,[nervously as they slowly and menacingly approach him], Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! ,[shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard. Back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to his office chair], SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
,Squidward:, Shut up! ,[slaps Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!
,Squidward:, I said ""shut up!,"" you bucket of bolts! ,[slaps him again],
,SpongeBob:, I can't take it! ,[runs off, crying],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, are you okay?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!
,Squidward:, No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs. ,[Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah.
,Squidward:, And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.
,SpongeBob:, Right. ,[runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? ,[slaps him again],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, let me handle this. ,[turns a light on Mr. Krabs], Where's Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[confused], What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs. ,[Squidward slaps him again],
,Squidward:, We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm Mr. Krabs.
,SpongeBob:, Where's Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm Mr. Krabs.
,Squidward:, Where's Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!
,SpongeBob:, This is one stubborn robot.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[confused, then angrily yells], What?! ,[his yelling knocks over the light and SpongeBob], You think I'm a robot?!
,Squidward:, We don't think; we know.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!
,Squidward:, ,[walks over to SpongeBob], He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.
,SpongeBob:, I got an idea. ,[pokes Squidward's nose], Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks. ,[runs out and returns later], If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. ,[holds up a blender],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his ""little buddy.""
,Squidward:, Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.
,Squidward:, We're just gonna see what your ""little buddy"" knows. ,[SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[panicking], No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!
,Squidward:, Where's Mr. Krabs? ,[shot of the blender], Not talking, eh? ,[breaks the blender with the bat],
,Mr. Krabs:, No! That cost me $24.95!
,SpongeBob:, I guess it didn't know anything.
,Squidward:, Go get the toaster. ,[SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk],
,Mr. Krabs:, No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! ,[Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk], $62.67! ,[Squidward breaks it with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk], Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. ,[Squidward breaks it], Nooo!
,SpongeBob:, ,[while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk], This is the last robot, Squidward.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator. ,[crying], No! ,[sobbing and then sobbing louder],
,Squidward:, I thought you said robots can't cry.
,SpongeBob:, I also said they couldn't love.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[crying], I loved it like it was me own.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, at least he's not laughing.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! ,[sobbing],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?
,SpongeBob:, The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... ,[slows down, as he realizes his mistake], imagination. ,[chuckles nervously, timpani noise, as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch], Hey, it's time to feed Gary. ,[runs out while Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[growling. The background shakes], Squidwaaaaaaaaaard!

"Plankton:, Oh, come on, Karen, please!
,Karen:, Well, if you must know...
,Plankton:, ,[interrupting], There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why, look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise. ,[Shows sauce melting through pan and onto floor where it then starts to melt through the floor], ,[Pause], Delectable!
,Karen:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, I'm sure it'll be a huge success!
,[Siren],
,Plankton:, Sorry, no time for your senseless chatter. I've got a customer to attend to!
,[Ding Ding],
,Billy:, Okay, so what about the Krabby Kola?
,Plankton:, We don't serve Krabby Kola, we carry Bucket Bubbler and Chum Cherry Blast.
,Billy:, Okay, well then, can I just make sure I get those Krabby Fries with extra Krabby Sauce?
,Plankton:, ,[frustrated], Ugh! How many times must I say it?! We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties! So, if you want any of those things, you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab, which is located directly across the street!
,Billy:, Okay, thanks for the directions.
,Plankton:, ,[annoyed], Any time. What is wrong with people?! Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, ""Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for!""
,Karen:, Yeah, and if anyone ever did order one of your meals, it probably would look them in the eye.
,Plankton:, You know, Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like I'm two inches tall. ,[Notices ruler right next to where he is standing showing he is indeed two inches tall],
,Karen:, Maybe in heels. If it wasn't for me, you probably wouldn't even remember to blink!
,Plankton:, Oh, come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today! ,[Pause], Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!
,Karen:, What's the matter?
,Plankton:, My eye is burning and I don't know why!
,Karen:, Blink.
,Plankton:, ,[blinks], Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!?
,Karen:, You were threatening to replace me.
,Plankton:, Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!
,Karen:, Oh, puh-leeze.
,Plankton:, I'll show you woman! ,[Marches away],
,[Later],
,Plankton:, Oh, Karen!
,[Shows Karen watching a computer movie],
,Karen:, Now what!?
,Plankton:, Could you come here for a moment?
,[Karen rolls in to the kitchen],
,Karen:, What do you want?
,Plankton:, Feast your, uh, screen on this. ,[Presses red button],
,[Contraption rolls out],
,Karen:, That’s my replacement!? It’s a toaster!
,Plankton:, Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind.
,T-119A Compumatic:, Good morning, sir.
,Plankton:, Good morning, T-119A!
,[robot short circuits],
,Plankton:, They're supposed to do that. ,[another robot is revealed], Next, behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement.
,[Robot tries to come through the doorway but can't, making the glass top break], ,[Water squirts everywhere],
,Karen:, ,[Sarcastically], That'll help you get the formula.
,Plankton:, And now, Karen, the ,piece de resistance,. ,[shows robot], Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery?
,Karen:, It sorta just looks like an old hair dryer taped to the back of a miniature windmill.
,Plankton:, I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that, Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right.
,Karen:, I don't recall you ever having reason to own a hair dryer, Plankton.
,Plankton:, Okay, here we go! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!?
,Karen:, What picture!?
,[Plankton walks down hallway and takes picture off the wall],
,[Shows Karen wedding picture of the two of them. Plankton has a full head of hair],
,Plankton:, You see! Plenty of reason to be using a hair dryer.
,Karen:, Why are we even talking about this?
,Plankton:, Because you were the one that said—
,[interrupted by torch sounding noises],
,Karen:, What's going on!?
,Plankton:, Dear Neptune!
,[Shows robots attacking each other],
,[Plankton tries to separate robots],
,Plankton:, Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something!
,[Karen presses the red button Plankton had been using],
,Plankton:, Not that one!
,[Siren sounds],
,[Plankton screams as a panel in SPU-31 flips open to reveal a hammer. It immediately targets Plankton and smashes him three times. Plankton walks back up to Karen, smushed.],
,Karen:, Well, it's good to see that that strategy didn't fall flat!
,Plankton:, You know, Karen, with you around, I'm beginning to wonder how I'm still alive.
,Karen:, Ohhh, so it's my fault is it?
,Plankton:, That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies!
,Karen:, You and your crack team of robots, huh?
,[Shows robots again beating each other up],
,Plankton:, Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you! ,[looks around], Karen? What's this? ,[Sees note on the ground], It's words on paper. It says: ""Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen."" Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error. ,[Laughs menacingly], Ow! ,[looks at note], ""P.S., don't forget to blink."" Oh yeah. ,[blinks],
,[Later],
,Plankton:, Okay, team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if we're going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand?
,[All robots but one make their noise of recognition],
,Plankton:, I said, does everybody understand!?
,[Last robot makes noise of recognition],
,Plankton:, All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position! ,[Shows robot fly through the air], SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!
,[Shows Plankton in the command module],
,Plankton:, Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all!

,Perch Perkins:, This just in, a diabolical albeit haphazardly thrown-together machine is attacking Bikini Bottom and is headed straight for the Krusty Krab! ,[click],
,[Squidward turns off the TV at the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, Why is the local news always such rubbish!?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, nobody cares about... ,[interrupted by rumbling and shaking],
,[Plankton's robot silhouette is seen in the dust approaching the Krusty Krab],
,[Plankton laughs menacingly],
,[Propeller from his windmill hits his head knocking off his hat],
,Plankton:, Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you.

,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, boy, get out there. ,[Throws SpongeBob outside towards Plankton's robot],
,SpongeBob:, Um... hello... what do you want robot thing, sir? ,[Plankton walks out on a boardwalk], Oh, hey Plankton! What are you doing here?
,Plankton:, I'm here for the secret formula you twit! Now I want you to go in there and tell Krabs that if he doesn't turn over the formula to me, that he'll be subjected to utter annihilation at my... Are you getting this?
,SpongeBob:, Uhhhhh, uuh uuh.
,Plankton:, Uuhhhh, moron! Okay, I'll make it simple: Krabs give me secret formula or I bring big boom boom to Krusty Krab. Got it?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Writing on clipboard], Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing?
,Plankton:, ,[Frustrated], Uhhh! Forget it! ,[Marches back into his command module, drops SpongeBob], Bring on the Boom Boom!

,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs emerge from the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs laughed at Plankton's failed attempt and the two walked away. ],
,[Robot collapses],
,Plankton:, ,[Crying], Oh curse you cruel fate. Once again, you've left me covered in the sticky goo of my own folly. Only this time, I'm all alone. ,[More crying],
,Karen:, Ahem.
,Plankton:, ,[Looks up and sees Karen], Karen! You've come back to me!
,Karen:, Actually, I just came to get my keyboard.
,Plankton:, Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away, I knew it!

,Plankton:, What you gonna do, machines these days, right? Umm, listen sweetie, I'm sorry about what I said. Truth is, I could never replace you honey-bunch. Lets go home hun?
,Karen:, ,[sigh], Okay.

,Mr. Krabs:, What's going on around here? ,[notices SpongeBob lying unconscious on the kitchen floor. He takes out the bottle containing the secret formula and the smell of it revives him. SpongeBob wakes up],
,SpongeBob ,[speaking gibberish],:, ,What's going on?
,Mr. Krabs: ,Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession... ,[points to a poster saying ""KENNY! The Cat"" with a picture of Kenny on it], ♪ Kenny the Cat ♪
,Mr. Krabs:, Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... ""the cat""?
,SpongeBob:, He's the greatest undersea athlete to originate from above the wet and briney. ,[points to several pictures of Kenny's famous career], And he's been shattering records all over, holding his breath as he walks the ocean floor. I want to be just like Kenny the Cat. ,[takes a deep breath and holds it as he walks to Mr. Krabs], That's what he does: he walks like that and holds his breath like that. Kenny is a sensationality. ,[takes out a tray of uncooked patties with lettuces cut in the shape of Kenny the Cat's head], Haven't you noticed my recent lettuce customization?
,Mr. Krabs:, No.
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up to a huge collection of magazines with Kenny the Cat on them], And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals? ,[turns on the tv], Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, no.

,SpongeBob:, But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo! ,[pulls down his pants and shows Patrick his tattoo],
,Patrick:, Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob! ,[runs away completely freaked out],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess it's plain to see who the true Kenny the Cat fan is. ,[cuts to SpongeBob still awake in his sleeping bag until his alarm clock goes off], 10:00! Kenny Time! ,[jumps out of his sleeping bag and stands next to the announcer],
,Announcer:, Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time you've all been waiting for. Kenny the Cat will do his signature walk. ,[Kenny comes down the street, photographers take pictures],
,SpongeBob:, ,[head turns into the shape of a heart] ,Kenny!
,Harold:, Thanks, Kenny! ,[Kenny signs his fin],
,SpongeBob:, Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula. ,[Kenny signs spatula], Thanks, Kenny. You're so real. ,[Kenny nods in agreement] ,Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab? ,[Kenny gives him his A-ok handsign. SpongeBob stutters], Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign! ,[does a silly dance] ,Swoon! Swoon! ,[cut to the Krusty Krab where a huge crowd is in front of it],
,Crowd:, ,[random chatter],
,Mr. Krabs: ,One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's. ,[quietly] ,And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars. ,[normal voice; shocked] ,Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host. ,[goes to Kenny ,Uh, excuse me. You just make yourself at home, Kenny. I mean, Mr. the Cat. ,[takes out two ketchup packets and one mustard packet] ,Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family. ,[laughs],
,[Kenny's oxygen tank slips from his back],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. the Cat? Everything OK? ,[Kenny draws a toilet and shows it to him] ,Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?
,Mr. Krabs:, What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! ""A clean cat is a moneymaking cat,"" I always say. Please avail yourself of the lounge facilities. ,[Kenny goes to the washroom],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'd best get back manning the grill.
,Kenny:, ,[takes out the oxygen tank and throws it on the ground], This gets real uncomfortable after a while. ,[breathes in. His face turns blue. He runs to the oxygen tank] ,
,SpongeBob:, ,[enters the bathroom with a Krabby Patty on a plate] ,Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to… ,[drops the patty] ,Whoa!
,Kenny:, ,[breathes through the oxygen tank and sighs. SpongeBob starts to panic], Good thing I've got this oxygen tank and mask, or otherwise there's no way I'd be able to hold my breath for this long.
,SpongeBob:, ,[camera zooms in to his heart which has a face. It loses a tooth and eye, then breaks] ,How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!
,Kenny,: But it's not what you think!
,SpongeBob:, There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears. ,[runs away, sobbing],
,Kenny:, SpongeBob, wait! ,[trips over the oxygen tank, and uses it again],
,SpongeBob:, I can't believe I fell for such a phony! Oh, well, time to move on. Guess I don't need my Kenny the Cat fan club membership card anymore. ,[rips card and sniffles], Or these Kenny the Cat posters. Oh, Kenny, how could you? ,[sobs],:, ,You were my idol! You know, I should really talk about this with someone, or I might get... ,[close up of his face] ,depressed.
,Kenny:, SpongeBob, please, let me explain! I'm just a cat with a dream. A dream to give the gift of hope. See, above water, I'm a nobody: just another annoying cat. But down here, I'm someone special: someone who can make people happy. And if making the world a happier place makes me a criminal... ,[starts to sob] ...,then lock me up and throw away the key. Have mercy! ,[sobbing],
,SpongeBob:, All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone.
,Kenny:, Really?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, really. 
,Kenny:, All right! Thanks, Bob. You're the best friend I ever had! Now if you'll excuse moi, I've got to sign some autographs. ,[exits the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, the cat of the hour is back!
,Crowd:, ,[cheering],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs? ,[Kenny nods his head],
,Crowd:, ,[cheering],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.
,Billy Fishbowl:, Sir, I just want to say that you're the biggest inspiration myself and my friends have ever known. Your ability to hold your breath changed our lives... forever. ,[looks at his three friends. They are holding their breath while their faces turn purple. One of them falls down],
,SpongeBob: ,[looks worried. He reads the note that Kenny wrote] "",You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem."" ,[gulps] ,""You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat""?
,Sandy:, Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature? ,[Kenny writes the signature] ,Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here.
,Kenny:, Mm-hmm.
,Sandy:, Just out of scientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long? ,[SpongeBob and Kenny react],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs nervously], Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy.
,Sandy:, I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic, ,[Kenny starts to sweat] ,considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes. ,[Sandy makes a serious face at Kenny. SpongeBob pushes her],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?
,Sandy:, ,[pushes him back] ,What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin, ,[Kenny's skin turns blue] ,followed by eventual unconsciousness.
,Kenny, ,[screaming],:, ,I can't take it! I need oxygen! ,[punches himself for his oxygen tank],
,Crowd:, ,[gasps],
,Kenny,: ,[uses the oxygen tank and sighs],
,Sandy:, I knew Kenny was a fake! 
,Crowd:, ,[boos and leaves],
,Crowd Member: ,Liar!
,Mr. Krabs: ,No! Come back! ,[to Kenny] ,Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too! ,[takes back the condiments he gave Kenny. Cut to outside],
,SpongeBob: ,Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.
,Kenny:, ,[in a suit like Sandy's] ,Aww. It's okay, SpongeBob. Maybe the whole shamble is a big wake-up call to be honest. 
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special.
,Kenny:, I like it! ,[does the A-ok handsign. SpongeBob does it back],
,Sandy:, Just get out of here already. ,[pops part of his suit, and he is rocketed back to the surface], You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?

That's disgusting! ,[pulls his foot away but the gum stays on his foot], Oh, c'mon! ,[tries pulling it off with his hands but they get stuck, then tries both of them and his head gets stuck.

,Squilliam:, Oooh! Maybe if you clean up Bikini Bottom, they'll build a statue of you! Oh, wait! They've already built one... of me! ,[camera zooms out to show a statue of Squilliam with a trash stick and a trash bag], I cleaned up all of Bikini Bottom in one week.

,Ideal Plankton:, Stunning.
,[Just then, an explosion knocks over Ideal Plankton from behind. Out from the smoke appears the virus. It roars and lets out blobs of green slime everywhere.],
,Ideal Plankton:, Hmm. Voracious virus!

,[But before Ideal Plankton can have his turn to swing across, the ground beneath him gave way and he falls into the ravine below.],
,Ideal Plankton:, It's up to you, SpongeBob! You must save Karen!

,SpongeBob:, Stop munching on those memories, you monster!
,[The virus turns and charges in on SpongeBob. But SpongeBob dodges it and the virus roars out green slime.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts on his karate gear], Hi-yah!
,[The virus morphs into a dragon and blows fire at SpongeBob. The fire disintegrates his karate gear into a cat outfit.],
,SpongeBob:, Meow?
,[The virus then chases SpongeBob all across Karen's memory banks until he bumps into a brick wall.],
,SpongeBob:, Plankton, I'm at the edge of Karen's memory! She has to create more memories! I need space to run.
,[Karen bursts out from the Wagon Wheel and heads straight for Bikini Bottom.],
,Plankton:, ,[running after her], Is my running after here enough of a memory?
,[The wall only moves a few inches.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm afraid not.
,[The virus closes in on SpongeBob and rams into him and the wall. The virus reverts back to normal and SpongeBob is cut up into little pieces. SpongeBob spins and puts himself back together.],
,SpongeBob:, I always wind up with one extra piece. ,[throws it on the ground and the virus eats it], Oh, you must be hungry. That's why you're eating through Karen.
,Virus:, I'm always hungry.
,SpongeBob:, You poor, ugly, disgusting little virus. I know what you need.
,[Back outside, Karen grows tired and her screen steams up smoke. Then she stops moves and shuts off.],
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, I've decided to pull you out. We're abandoning Operation: Save Karen.
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens up Karen's screen], I got the virus. ,[comes out with a microscope], Look.
,[Plankton looks through the microscope and sees the virus.],
,Virus:, Hi, there!
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs the virus and puts it on a Krabby Patty], Here you go, little fella. It'll take the virus 300 years to chew its way through this sandwich.
,Virus:, Whoo-hoo!
,Karen:, ,[wakes up], Oh. Huh?
,Plankton:, ,[being shown as Ideal Plankton as Karen looks at him], Baby, you're all right!
,Karen:, Nope, I'm still delirious. But I like it! ,[laughs],

"[The episode starts in the Chum Bucket where Karen drops chum from a paper bag],
,Karen:, Another bag of chum... ,[smells it], Bleh, now to shape this into his Highness' dinner request. ,[Karen's screen shows a drink, pizza, a hamburger and pie, then releases a laser from her head and shoots it to the chum pile and the chum becomes a drink, a pie, and more chum; delivers it to Plankton.],
,Plankton:, ,[using welding tool on circuit board], Almost done.
,Karen:, ,[gives Plankton the food], Here you go. Eat up.
,Plankton:, What's this supposed to be?
,Karen:, Chum seaweed, chum pot pie, chum con coral, and chum tea. Also known as dinner.
,Plankton:, Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry.
,Karen:, Well, I told you months ago that my memory is full but you've been too busy with your latest project. So tell me, Plankton, how do you plan on failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula this time?
,Plankton:, Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you, foolproof! ,[laughs evilly and picks up circuit], Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well. ,[places circuit board into motherboard of the same size and shape and presses button on motherboard], ,[the outer core of the button begins to transition from left to right as if identifying the percentage of time left for the robot to start up],
,[A robot screen turns around and points towards Plankton],
,Plankton:, Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife!
,[Screen lights up and then straightens out to a red line matching the original Karen's],
,Plankton:, Karen 2!
,Karen:, ,[gasps], Karen 2?! I've been...replaced?!
,Plankton:, I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design. ,[chuckles], The whole package!
,Karen:, I can't believe this! And after all I've done for you! You dumped me for this cheap pile of plastic?!
,Plankton:, Well, I had to cut cost somewhere.
,Karen 2.0:, Who are you calling cheap? At least I don't rust!
,Karen:, You know, you're going to wish that you'd deleted that comment!
,Plankton:, Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine.
,Karen:, Oh that does it! ,[Karen's screen shows ""Loading: Jealousy Scheduler; the screen has a bar that indicates the amount of percentage it has loaded],
,Plankton:, Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler.
,[When the scheduler becomes fully loaded, a laser ejects from Karen's head],
,Plankton:, And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?
,[Karen's screen then shows a picture of a pie and then a stir fry. She aims the laser at Plankton.],
,Karen:, Here's your stir fry, little man!
,[She blasts the ray at Plankton, but he evades it.],
,Plankton:, Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret! ,[He runs the other way until Karen appears in front of him],
,Karen:, You should know regret's the one thing you left out of my operating system! ,[Karen charges up her molecular rearranging ray preparing to zap Plankton, but then Karen shuts down.],
,Plankton:, Huh, what happened?
,Karen 2.0:, I accessed the Chum Bucket's power grid, remotely cutting off Karen's power at the source.
,Plankton:, Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard! Goodbye, Karen Classic, ,[leaps onto Karen 2.0], hello, Karen 2! ,[He then laughs maniacally and the camera zooms out to the Chum Bucket at night. It pans over to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are outside.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, the end of another lucrative work day, SpongeBob. ,[He takes out his key and locks the doors to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in a depressed tone], Yes, the end. ,[filling with tears], Quitting time is almost too much to bear.
,Mr. Krabs:, Seriously, son, you gotta lighten up. Well, good night, kiddo. ,[He walks away],
,SpongeBob:, Good night, sir. ,[catches up to Mr. Krabs], See ya tomorrow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet.
,SpongeBob:, Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye ,[Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes in annoyance as they pass the Chum Bucket.], Toodaloo! Whoa! ,[SpongeBob trips over something. The camera then zooms out to reveal that SpongeBob tripped over a box with Karen's body inside it.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash. ,[continues to walk away],
,[SpongeBob gets himself out of the box and looks at it],
,SpongeBob:, This isn't a pile of trash. ,[picks up Karen's head], It's a free computer system.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[zooms back and taking Karen's head], Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?
,SpongeBob:, Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton.
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.
,SpongeBob:, Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?
,Mr. Krabs:, Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer? ,[packs Karen's head in the box and brings it in the Krusty Krab], Let's plug her in, see what she can do.
,[The scene bubbles over to Mr. Krabs' office. Mr, Krabs turns on Karen's monitor. Then Karen's screen shows Loading],
,Mr. Krabs:, She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works. ,[places the telephone receiver on top of Karen and her screen shows an hourglass turning.], This thing does text mails right?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I think so.
,[Karen's screen shows the words Karen Classic with her picture on it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that sounds promising.
,[Karen starts crying on her screen and scaring Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady.
,Karen:, Don't tell me not to cry! ,[continues crying and scaring Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob again.],
,Mr. Krabs:, She's malfunctioning!
,SpongeBob:, Must be the dial-up thingy!
,Mr. Krabs:, You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry! ,[grabs the telephone and throws it against the wall destroying it in the process],
,Karen:, Oh it's not the dial-up thingy. It's Plankton, he dumped me for a newer piece of hardware. ,[continues crying],
,Mr. Krabs:, Help me out here, buddy. ,[pushes SpongeBob next to Karen],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean, you guys were made for each other. Well, you were made more for him and more specifically by him, and now, he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?
,Karen:, ,[sobs], You men are all alike! ,[hops off Mr. Krabs' desk and onto her mobile body. She hops out of the box and then rolls out of the office.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait! Where ya goin’? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth. ,[comes out of his office and sees Karen looking outside the window], Let's talk this out.
,SpongeBob:, Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what part of ""free computer"" are you not understanding?
,[Cuts back to the scene where Karen is looking at the Chum Bucket through the Krusty Krab windows. Plankton's laughter is heard. The scene then shows one of the Chum Bucket door entrance window and we can see silhouettes of Plankton and Karen 2.0 having a romantic dinner with each other],
,Plankton:, Tonight, we celebrate, and tomorrow, the secret formula. ,[He continues laughing and the scene pans back to Karen looking out from the Krusty Krab window],
,Karen:, I don't ever want to see that low life again as long as I live. Goodbye, you miserable little bug! ,[Karen's screen shows a mouse picking up a Plankton icon and placing it in the recycling bin.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, in the case, welcome aboard! ,[puts a Krusty Krew hat on Karen's head],
,SpongeBob:, All right!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeehaw! ,[They give each other high fives while Karen shows an annoyed face on her screen],
,[Bubble transitions to morning where we see Squidward going inside the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[he stops and sees Karen at the cash register],
,Karen:, Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
,Squidward:, My order?
,Mr. Krabs:, I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail. Karen will be taking over your duties from now on, Mr. Squidward. She's efficient and more importantly: I don't have to pay her.
,Squidward:, So, I'm fired? No more taking orders? ,[more happily], No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob!? I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free! ,[cheering], Whoo.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not so fast, Mr. Squidward.
,[Bubble transitions over to Squidward in the bathroom holding a mop. It turns out that Mr. Krabs had given him bathroom duty. Squidward sighs in disappointment. The scene then cuts to three fish in line waiting to take their order.],
,Ivy (gray):, Hi there, can I get a Krabby Patty and a side of coral bits please?
,Karen:, You'll get your Krabby Patty when I'm good and ready! ,[she turns to SpongeBob], Sorry, I'm just... ,[sniffs], ...going through a lot emotionally, right now.
,SpongeBob:, Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?
,Karen:, You defragment your hard drive?
,SpongeBob:, No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world: The Krusty Krab.
,[He hears thumping. The customers look to the door to see Karen 2.0 trying to get in the Krusty Krab, but she couldn't open the doors due to her not having any arms. Plankton peeks out of a secret compartment in Karen 2.0],
,Plankton:, Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself, you know.
,Karen 2.0:, I'm trying to open the door. You didn't exactly design me with arms, you know.
,Plankton:, Yes, I suppose that's true. All right, I got this. ,[He is about to climb out of Karen 2.0, but then he gasps when he sees Karen at the cash register.], What's ,she, doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?! 
,[Karen 2.0 gets pushed into the Krusty Krab by some fish wanting to come in. Karen 2.0 gets pushed in front of Karen.],
,Karen:, Well, if it isn't Little Miss Home-Wrecker.
,Karen 2.0:, And if it isn't the washed up analog has-been.
,[Plankton pops out of his compartment in Karen 2.0 to listen in on the two Karens' argument.],
,Karen:, Analog? Who you calling analog?!
,[Plankton quickly goes back inside the compartment sensing a fight is about to begin],
,Karen 2.0:, I see you've taken your proper role as a ""Cash Machine.""
,Karen:, At least I don't look like I was designed to be a glorified vacuum cleaner!
,Karen 2.0:, Well, at least I can say I ,was, designed.
,Karen:, ,[Gasps], Why I oughta...!
,Karen 2.0:, You rusty bucket of bolts.
,Karen:, You glorified toaster oven!
,Karen 2.0:, You poor excuse for a house wife.
,[The fish gasp and start talking],
,Nazz-Mini:, Hey, what's going on?
,Dave:, I don't know, but my money's on the one with the chrome back side.
,Mr. Krabs:, Seriously? Did you just say money?
,[Microphone lowers down and Mr. Krabs grabs it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?
,Karen 2.0:, Prepare to have your motherboard rattled.
,Mr. Krabs:, ...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?
,Karen:, You're about to have your cookies crumbled!
,Karen 2.0:, Bring it.
,[Karen and Karen 2.0 start fighting],
,Plankton:, Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.
,[Karen grabs Karen 2.0 by the neck],
,Karen:, ,[Growls],
,[Karen 2.0 kicks Karen],
,[Karen uppercuts Karen 2.0 and she flies backwards],
,[Karen 2.0 headbutts Karen],
,Karen 2.0:, That will defrag your algorithms. ,[A crunching noise is heard],
,Plankton:, Ow!
,Karen 2.0:, Plankton?
,[Karen 2.0 moves back from a squished Plankton],
,[Plankton groans in pain and audience gasps],
,Karen:, ,[shakes her head], Stop! He's hurt!
,Karen 2.0:, You're throwing in the towel?
,Karen:, You heartless homepage-wrecking hussy!
,[Karen's arms start spinning around rapidly and she moves towards Karen 2.0],
,[Karen 2.0's screen is broken off by Karen's arms and Karen 2.0 falls to the ground and breaks],
,[Audience cheers],
,Karen:, No one runs down my man. Planky, say something...
,Plankton:, Take me home, baby...
,Karen:, Even though you are a tiny green loser, I could never stay... ,[Static], ... mad ,[Static], ...at ,[Static], ...you. ,[Static], ,[Screen turns off],
,[Karen falls to the ground, Plankton screams and dodges],
,Plankton:, Karen! Don't you leave me, Karen. Not again!
,[Plankton opens up Karen 2.0's compartment, takes her battery out and places it in Karen's compartment],
,Plankton:, I hope this works... Oh, Karen, please wake up! I promise never to take you for granted again!
,[Karen's screen shows a spinning hourglass],
,Karen:, ,[Screen changes to her speaking line], What happened?
,Plankton:, I had a reality check, that's what happened.
,[Audience claps and Karen stands up],
,Plankton:, Come on. Let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey.
,Karen:, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt there were two of me!
,Plankton:, Two of you? Heh, well that is strange.
,[Karen 2.0's screen explodes. Karen and the customers leave the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, great. There goes me revenue. What am I gonna do now?

,[A medical crew comes and takes out the people in a ball],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ohhhhhh. ,[he quivers, looks upon the stage],
,[A pile of contestants is on the ring floor],
,Contestant:, My leg! My leg.
,[A janitor sweeps the pile from the ring],
,Mr. Krabs:, No living soul should have to suffer through what I've witnessed here today. Except maybe...
,[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick run to the stage blindfolded and excited and they both laugh. Mr. Krabs guides them with a leash],
,SpongeBob:, Where are you taking us, Mr. Krabs? ,[they continue to laugh],
,[Mr. Krabs releases the leash],

,Patrick:, ,[pops out from one of the wrestlers' chest hair], And hairy.
,[Wrestler #2 picks up and breathes on SpongeBob who coughs every time he gets blown on],
,SpongeBob:, And it smells angry.
,Patrick:, Is it time to look yet?
,SpongeBob:, You peek first.
,Patrick:, No, you peek first.
,[Wrestler #2 squeezes SpongeBob until his eyeballs pop out and see the wrestlers and Wrestler #1 does same to Patrick.Both of them scream and get out of the wrestlers' hands and run behind Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, who are those guys, Mr. Krabs? They look like they wanna hurt us.
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Those two? Ah, they're harmless. It's all just part of the act.
,SpongeBob:, The act?
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course. They're just pretending.
,Patrick:, Pretending?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, We like pretending.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Don't we all?
,Patrick:, Can we wear costumes?
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh... sure.

,Mr. Krabs:, You can do it!
,Announcer:, And on the opposite side of the ring, we have the undefeated champions.
,[Wrestler #1 lifts up a barbell then Wrestler #2 crushes the barbell with his bare hands and puts it in a Krabby Patty and eats it then burps in Wrestler #1's face until his skin rips off as the crowd boos],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts... ,[As the 2 wrestlers' shadows go over them, the announcer runs away],
,SpongeBob:, Did it just get dark in here?
,Patrick:, Dark?! I'm afraid of the dark.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't be afraid. It's just them.
,Patrick:, Oh, right, it's just those guys we're gonna wrestle. ,[Waves at them], Hello, fellow competitors. ,[Wrestler #1 screams so loud that they fall to the ground],

,[They both get punched more and more until they turn to liquid. Wrestler #1 gargles SpongeBob and Patrick and spits them out into the drain. The crowd groans as they slosh down the drain. An impatient Mr. Krabs uses a plunger to get them out.],

,SpongeBob:, Right! C'mon, Patrick, let's show these two who they're messing with.
,Patrick:, With pleasure.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Let's do this!
,[They both walk away with angry expressions],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's the million dollar winning spirit.
,SpongeBob:, Alright, you two, no more messing around. You see this? ,[pulls out his spatula], It's just a spatula, right? Wrong! Actually, this represents your face after I get through mangling it. ,[tries to bend spatula but can only bend it a little bit], There, you see that? It's not gonna be pretty when I get done with ya.
,Patrick:, Hey, good one, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Patrick. Now you try saying something intimidating as well.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[Takes SpongeBob's spatula], And if you think this is bad, wait till I get my hands on ya. ,[takes out a piece of paper], I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna... tear ya to shreds! Like a... ,[struggles with ripping the paper], C'mon! Ah! I got a paper cut! Paper cut! ,[starts sucking his hands],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, are you okay?
,Patrick:, Huh? Oh, I'm fine. I just like to suck on my hand.
,SpongeBob:, Really? Me, too. ,[They both suck on their hands. Wrestler #1 picks up Patrick and squishes him into a ball. Mr. Krabs screams thinking he's gonna get hurt but Wrestler #1 takes the rope],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh. Heh heh. Now what?
,[Wrestler #1 ties the rope to Patrick. He then picks up SpongeBob and puts the rope connected to Patrick behind his back. Then he pretends it's a paddleball.],

,Patrick:, Good catch! ,[Wrestler #2 twists him and Wrestler #1 does same to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Look, I'm a...
,Patrick:, Helicopter.
,[They collide and are shredded into pieces. They fall into a wagon and Wrestler #1 throws the wagon in a cement truck. Both scream as the truck starts blending them and the crowd cheers. Mr. Krabs bites on the rope nervously. Inside the truck, Wrestler #2 pulls the pour lever and SpongeBob and Patrick come out as cement and go into the wagon. Whistling, Wrestler #1 pours them into deep spaces and they dry out. Wrestler #1 puts his hand in SpongeBob and writes ""Jim was here"" with his finger. SpongeBob giggles. Wrestler #2 puts his foot in Patrick and writes ""My foot was here"" with his toe. Patrick giggles. The wrestlers both laugh and butt heads. Mr. Krabs pulls them out with 2 spatulas.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you doing out there?!
,SpongeBob:, Fake wrestling.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, but you still have to try to win in fake wrestling.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, we're having so much fun. Doesn't that make us winners?
,Mr. Krabs:, Actually... ,[literally steaming mad], It doesn't! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick just stand there], Okay, okay, look. Just... ,[notices they're gone], Hey, where'd they... ,[gasps], Oh, no! Not the...

,[Patrick and Wrestler #2 is doing the same thing. Patrick does baby talk before being handed a bottle.],
,Crowd:, Aw.
,[The wrestlers then put them in a bed and cover them with a blanket],
,Perch Perkins:, And it looks like the champs are ready to end it.
,Mr. Krabs:, End it?!

,[The wrestlers dig a hole in the sand floor. Wrestler #1 grabs one of the ropes and the wrestlers use it as a slingshot to launch themselves high into the air and through the ceiling of the arena.

,Perch Perkins:, Yep. They're gonna leave more than a mark with this special move. The mother of all moves, the Flying Double Decker Atomic Headbutt of Destruction... ,[The wrestlers literally start spinning like a drill], with a spin.

If you're watching this video, then let me be the first to say: Congratulations! ,[a rainbow with the word ""Congratulations"" appears], You've recently been hired in the Krusty Krab ,[a spatula, a hat, and a bucket appear in SpongeBob's hands], and this is your first official day of training.
,SpongeBob:, Can I make a Krabby Patty now?
,Narrator:, Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph... ,[Scene cuts to a giraffe. Narrator clears his throat], ,Graph!, ,[A graph is shown. The Krusty Krab is moving up.], You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't get that way over night... ,[it is night time], ...because the store closes at 6:00. ,[scene cuts to picture of Mr. Krabs and the Krusty Krab behind him], No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat. ,[scene zooms into one of Mr. Krabs' armpits], But mostly his sweat. ,[scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right and stops on the screen, followed by sparkles], From Humble Beginnings. ,[scene cuts to a sepia picture of Mr. Krabs as a child, walking up to a soda machine with a quarter on a string wrapped around his hand], You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today. ,[Mr. Krabs puts in his quarter then takes it out; it's attached to a piece of rope with a hole in the quarter], And you're right! ,[Mr. Krabs laughs while drinking his soda. Scene cuts to a tired Mr. Krabs, sitting depressed in a room with light at the window], After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless. ,[scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, now a retirement home with elderly fish outside playing shuffleboard], But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born. ,[Mr. Krabs paints a giant ""K"" with a bucket full of red paint, on a sign outside.

,Hoopla fish:, Hoopla! ,[Scrolls over to a small fish yelling], Hoopla! ,[someone off screen throws a brick on the fish, knocking him unconscious. Screen scrolls back to the patty],
,Narrator:, Sounds like a lot of hoopla to make over a little Krabby Patty, right? ,[chuckles], Wrong! ,[scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right again], The Krusty Krab today. ,[scene cuts to a series of close-ups in the Krusty Krab. Then scene cuts to a view of the inside of the Krusty Krab where customers are eating Krabby Patties], To keep up with today's demanding customers, no expense has been spared to acquire all the latest achievements in fast-food technology.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[holds up a spatula in his left hand], This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism. ,[now standing at the register], Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch! ,[now holding some ice cubes], These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported. ,[holds up a straw], This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine. ,[puts the straw in the cup and drinks it], And most importantly, ,[holds up some ketchup packets], You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.
,Narrator:, ,[SpongeBob is standing there when a packet of ketchup, spatula, a cash register, cup, and ice cubes appear around him], All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it? ,[the items spin around him], Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check. ,[items disappear and SpongeBob floats to the right. The scene changes to SpongeBob standing next to Squidward near the cash register], But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder. ,[close-up of SpongeBob], Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, ""Hello world! May I take your order?"" You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants! But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good. ,[close-up of Squidward reading his dance magazine], Let's see, inattentive, impatient, a glazed look in the eyes. ,[close-up of the button Squidward is wearing on his shirt], Look carefully at the ""I Really Wish I Weren't Here Right Now!"" button. There's a name for employees like this, but we'll call him Squidward.
,Squidward:, I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in his office], Sorry, can't hear you! ,[scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right],
,Narrator:, Training.
,SpongeBob:, Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?
,Narrator:, No, you can't make a Krabby Patty without understanding the phrase POOP.
,SpongeBob:, POOP?
,Narrator:, Once you understand POOP, you'll understand your place at the Krusty Krab. But what does POOP mean? ,[SpongeBob shrugs his arms], It's actually a carefully organized code. Watch closely. People Order Our Patties.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, POOP! ,[smiles proudly],
,Narrator:, Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP. ,[scene cuts to a customer walking up to Squidward], Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.
,Harold:, I'd like to order- ,[screen freezes to a quiz],
,Narrator:, Do you think he's going to order: A: A sofa, B: An expensive haircut, or C: A patty?
,Harold:, One patty please.
,Narrator:, Ah, POOP! You never let us down! ,[scene cuts to a giant Krabby Patty], Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, Krabby Patty! ,[panting towards the Krabby Patty but once he gets too close, he gets splattered on the screen with a fly swatter],
,Narrator:, Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about: ,[scene cuts to a toilet], Personal Hygiene. ,[toilet flushes. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in front of a sink], Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines. ,[SpongeBob turns the faucet on], Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift? ,[SpongeBob lathers his hands], A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails. ,[SpongeBob nods and rubs a bit harder], And don't forget about the knuckles. ,[SpongeBob rubs a bit harder], And make sure those palms are squeaky clean. ,[SpongeBob rubs the hardest he can], All right, let's see those hands. ,[holds up his arms but it is invisible from rubbing so much], Now that's thorough! ,[chuckles. Scene cuts to SpongeBob's shiny boots], After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils, ,[SpongeBob cuts his boil off with scissors], and your hair is neat and tidy, ,[SpongeBob lifts up his hat, sprays a little hairspray on a single hair to make it straight, then puts his hat back on], you are ready to start the day. Now let's see how Squidward prepares for his shift. ,[one of the bathroom stall doors opens to show Squidward sitting on the toilet with his dance magazine on his lap. He then notices that people are looking at him. He laughs nervously and shuts the stall door shut], Remember, no employee wants to be a Squidward! ,[a giant Krabby Patty appears on the screen again], Now that you're clean and hygienic, I bet you think you're ready to make that Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, ,[yells in excitement], I'm ready! ,[splits into two SpongeBobs], I'm ready! ,[splits into more SpongeBobs], I'm ready! ,[splits himself into more SpongeBobs until fly swatters splat all of them on the screen],
,Narrator:, Whoa there! We have a few more topics to cover first. ,[scene cuts to food and a spatula lying on a table], Your Work Station. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob vacuuming on top of the stove], It's important to keep your area tidy and free of droppings. But a clean workstation is only part of the job. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob thinking of a Krabby Patty in a thought bubble of his], To make the vision in your head a reality, you'll need supplies. And a good employee always keeps his supplies well-organized. ,[SpongeBob opens up a cabinet, then opens the bottom drawer to reveal a bunch of folders with names of condiments and ingredients on there], Very nice, Mr. SquarePants, not a pickle out of place. ,[SpongeBob peeks out the kitchen door], Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station. ,[Squidward is sleeping with a dance magazine on his face. He wakes up],
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[shouts], Oh! ,[falls on the floor. The cash register drawer opens up and conks Squidward in the head],
,Narrator:, Don't worry, Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to the grill], Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty. ,[SpongeBob barks like a dog then runs around the room. Narrator laughs], Calm down. ,[a bone is thrown at him then he grabs it with his teeth and gnaws it], There's plenty of time left. We have to make sure you're ready for the psychological aspect of the job: ,[A execution chair is seen], Interfacing with your Boss. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Mr. Krabs in his office],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?
,Mr. Krabs:, No.
,Narrator:, Good job, Mr. SquarePants!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up to the camera], Can I make a Krabby Patty now- ,[scene cuts to Patrick walking into the Krusty Krab],
,Narrator:, Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer. Or as we like to say, the ""Krustomer""!
,Patrick:, ,[stops], Who said that? Are you a ghost?
,Narrator:, Like precious, precious blood in an animal, the customer is what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive.
,Patrick:, Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!
,Squidward:, Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?
,Patrick:, Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah... ,[falls asleep and snores until Squidward snaps at him causing him to wake up], Huh? What's that?
,Squidward:, Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.
,Narrator:, Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr. Krabs says.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[A cut-out of Mr. Krabs and the sentence ""The money is always right!"" are seen], The money is always right!
,Patrick:, The ceiling is right, Squidward. You're not a very good employee.
,Squidward:, Fine. May I please take your order?
,Patrick:, I'll have uhh... uhhhh... ,[drones again as Squidward gets mad and grabs the cash register],
,Narrator:, We'll check up on these two later. ,[scene cuts to a siren], Right now, it's important that we discuss an emergency situation! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a Krabby Patty looking around for something], Like the lost gold of Atlantis, many consider the Krabby Patty to be a treasure. And as with every treasure, there's a thief ready to steal it. So it's up to you to be the watchful eyes of... ,[the Krabby Patty moves as metal legs come out of it and it walks off], What's this? ,[Plankton is on the patty], It's Mr. Krabs business rival, Plankton!
,Plankton:, Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob with a face of shock],
,Narrator:, He's stealing the formula! What are you going to do, Mr. SquarePants? ,[SpongeBob screams and runs around the restaurant. Mr. Krabs walks up to Plankton as he and the patty are going really slow],
,Plankton:, You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into maximum overdrive! ,[whips the Krabby Patty into going faster, but only slightly], Hi-ya! ,[mechanical legs whirring, Mr. Krabs grabs the patty], I knew I should've gotten the turbo. ,[SpongeBob is still screaming and knocking over tables and chairs], Hear me, Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead... ,[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton, who is now talking in a high-pitched voice in fast motion. He flicks him back to the Chum Bucket, Mr. Krabs seeing SpongeBob is still screaming.],
,Narrator:, And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr. SquarePants. ,[scene cuts to Squidward and Patrick, Patrick is still saying: ""Uhhhhhh..."" Squidward looks annoyed], Let's check in on Squidward again. Psst, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Huh?
,Narrator:, Just remember POOP.
,Squidward:, Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?
,Patrick:, Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], Will that be for here or to go? ,[closes his mouth, but Patrick is droning again. Squidward bangs his head on the register],
,Narrator:, Hang in there, Squidward, it's all part of the job. ,[scene cuts to a shot of the Krusty Krab training manual], Now that you've learned the basics of your training, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for. ,[a blue screen appears with the Krabby Patty slowly coming closer to the screen.,
,Narrator:, Preparing the Krabby Patty! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob bowing down to a poster of a Krabby Patty], At the center of every great dynasty is the crown jewel which keeps it alive and thriving. ,[SpongeBob crawls to the poster], For the Krusty Krab, this is the Krabby Patty. ,[SpongeBob licks the patty that is on the poster], And now you, the humble employee off the street, the all-too-necessary human resource that keeps this business afloat, will learn the sacred and dark secrets of how to prepare, with your very own hands... ,[SpongeBob gasps], the sumptuousness, lip-moistening, spine-tingling, heart-stopping pleasure center that is a Krabby Patty! Are you ready? ,[SpongeBob nods], Are you sure? ,[SpongeBob nods his head harder and his head tears in half], Okay!

,Security Guard:, Will you ever learn how to use those doors?
,SpongeBob:, Never!

The trash robot then takes control of the coffeemaker, the microwave oven, the pencil sharpener, the paper shredder and and the soda machine.

,[The last wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. Now, the entire building is completely destroyed. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick finally cleaning the stain off the floor of the main office right before dawn.],
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob SquarePants always keeps his word. That carpet is clean.
,Patrick:, And I helped!
,SpongeBob:, You sure did, buddy! Come on, pal. Let's go get us a snack.
,Patrick:, Oh, I like that sound, SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick leave the building as it now stands in ruin. Meanwhile, the worker, who was not aware of the destruction, gets up from his chair, stretches and prepares to leave. However, he falls downward. The security guard enters the ruins of the building and catches the worker. He sees the place completely destroyed and drops the worker.],
,Security Guard:, I quit.

"[The episode begins at a birthday party. The kids are having a fun time and Mr. Krabs is providing catering service to the kids.],
,Squidward:, I cannot believe I let you talk me into this.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, come now, Mr. Squidward. Catering is a great way for you to make a little extra money. And me to make a lot!
,[They stop and see a little kid screaming.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Any ideas?
,[Squidward throws a patty into the screaming kid's mouth.],
,Squidward:, How's that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Perfect, now get out there and feed the rest of those kids.
,[Squidward sees the kids and imagines them as germs.],
,Squidward:, They all seem so... full of germs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Why, of course they're full of germs. They're kids. Why do you think I'm wearing this full-body latex covering? ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, Okay, I'm going in.
,[Squidward inhales himself and covers his nose.],
,Squidward:, Krabby Patty? Krabby Patty? ,[groans],
,Kid:, Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. ,[pokes on the patties with his germy hands],
,Squidward:, You're contaminating the food! Just pick one!
,[The kid sneezes on Squidward and the Krabby Patties. The patties are now covered in mucus, much to Squidward's disgust. The kid takes a patty.],
,Squidward:, ,[screams as he shakes his head], I've been infected!
,[Three kids come up and eat the mucus covered Krabby Patties. Squidward finds this incredibly disgusting and throws up, scaring the kids. Patrick is dressed as a clown to entertain several of the kids.],
,Patrick:, Hey, kids, I'm a—
,[The kids scream at Patrick's clown outfit. Patrick screams and hides in the coral tree.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, I'm not paying you to play hide-and-seek! These children want to be entertained! Get down here! ,[shakes the tree],
,[Patrick falls off the tree.],
,Kid:, I want a balloon animal.
,[Patrick gets up.],
,Patrick:, Uh, um.
,[Patrick takes out several balloons, stretches them, and blows air through them. Then he ties them together to form a rock-shaped balloon.],
,Kid:, What is it?
,Patrick:, A rock.
,[The rock-shaped balloon carries the kid away. Mr. Krabs is putting a blindfold over the eyes of the birthday boy, Billy.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, birthday boy. Take a swing at that piñata, son.
,[Billy swings his stick and tries to break a piñata shaped like Plankton. Billy hits Mr. Krabs with the stick.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oof! ,[laughs], Don't hit nice old Mr. Krabs. ,[laughs], It's the piñata you want, son.
,[Billy peeks through the blindfold and hits Mr. Krabs with the stick. Mr. Krabs cracks and breaks open money.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me money! Do I look like a piñata to you, boy?
,Billy:, Yes, get him!
,[The kids grab torches and pitchforks and chase Mr. Krabs around. Mr. Krabs hides behind the tree, but the kids find him and continue to chase him. SpongeBob, who appears as a bouncing house, has children bounce inside his body.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Higher! Go higher!
,[A goth kid walks up and is wearing spiky cleats.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, don't forget to take your shoes off before bouncing.
,[The goth kid doesn't listen and runs into SpongeBob's body, popping holes with his cleats. SpongeBob explodes and is sent flying.],
,SpongeBob:, Ow!
,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward become terrified at the kids' wild behavior.],
,Squidward:, We have to get out of here! These children are menaces!
,Patrick:, They tore off my head.
,[Patrick is shown with his severed body. Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob exclaim in fear.],
,SpongeBob:, Maybe we should make a break for it, Mr. Krabs.
,[Billy appears in Mr. Krabs' pants.],
,Billy:, I want my birthday cake!
,[Mr. Krabs screams.],
,Billy:, Cake, cake!
,[Mr. Krabs takes Billy out of his pants and throws him away.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, men, let's cheese it!
,[Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick, and SpongeBob retreat to their catering truck. When all of a sudden, a high-class woman with her pet worm is observing the truck. They immediately stop.],
,Ms. Mildred:, Oh, my, are you the high-class caterers I hired for an extraordinarily large sum of money?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes!
,SpongeBob:, No!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[covers SpongeBob's mouth], Yes.
,SpongeBob:, ,[speaks through his head], No!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[throws SpongeBob's mouth back in his head], Yes. ,[shuts SpongeBob's mouth],
,Ms. Mildred:, I do not have time for this tomfoolery. I have a mansion full of very high-class guests waiting for a high-class catering. Are you they or are you nay?
,Mr. Krabs:, Indubitably, madam. We are your high-class caterers.
,Ms. Mildred:, But where are your tuxedos?
,Mr. Krabs:, Tuxedos? Oh, just give us a moment to suit up, me good lady.
,[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward, SpongeBob, and Patrick away for a moment.],
,Squidward:, Now, where are we going to get tuxedos from?
,Mr. Krabs:, You.
,Squidward:, Hey, what are you—
,[Mr. Krabs grabs Squidward and squeezes ink out from his head. Mr. Krabs, Squidward, SpongeBob, and Patrick are now wearing tuxedos made out of squid ink.],
,Squidward:, Ew.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ready to serve you, Miss Money Bags—er, I—I mean, ma'am.
,Ms. Mildred:, Very nice. Here is your payment.
,[Ms. Mildred gives Mr. Krabs a check for 50,000,00 dollars. Mr. Krabs is thrilled and rolls around on the ground with the check. SpongeBob snatches the check from Mr. Krabs.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you can't take that check. We're not high-class caterers.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs the check from SpongeBob], We are anything we need to be for me to make this money.
,[Mr. Krabs rolls the check and stores it in his head.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Unless you wanna go back to the kids' party.
,[Mr. Krabs points to the birthday party, which is now a complete mess as the kids are destroying everything and running wild.],
,All:, No!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's what I thought. Then start setting up inside.
,[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick run into Ms. Mildred's mansion.],
,Patrick:, This place is so shiny.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, and so are the people.
,Squidward:, Oh, there's no way those people are gonna think our junk food is high class.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm, you might be right. SpongeBob, go find something to fancy-up the food.
,SpongeBob:, Fancy. Got it, Mr. Krabs.
,[SpongeBob runs to the kitchen.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Good, now I'll just get the lay of the land around here.
,[Billy appears in Mr. Krabs' pants again.],
,Billy:, I want my birthday cake!
,[Squidward and Patrick run screaming.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Great Neptune's ghost!
,Billy:, I want my cake! I want my cake!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, kid, easy, easy. Just calm down, will ya? I got your cake.
,Billy:, You did?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, yeah. ,[opens door], Your birthday cake is right through here. ,[throws Billy out the door],
,Billy:, Where? I don't see any—
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs as he closes the door], Won't be seeing him again any time soon.
,[Billy appears at the window, scaring Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs closes five windows while Billy is speaking.],
,Billy:, I—Want—My—Birthday—Cake!
,[Mr. Krabs sighs in relief. However, Billy opens all five windows, and five Billies appear.],
,Billies:, I want my birthday cake!!!
,[Mr. Krabs screams in horror and runs away from the Billies. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward show up with the food they prepared.],
,SpongeBob:, What do you think of this, Mr. Krabs? ,[shows Mr. Krabs Krabby Patties with jewelry on them], I call it, ""Krabby Pâté."" Classy, huh? Serve it while it's hot, Patrick.
,[Patrick walks off to serve the food.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, were those jewels on the patties?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. You said, ""Fancy-up the food"", so I found some shiny stuff for garnish. Got a whole box.
,Mr. Krabs:, What the— ,[gasps], SpongeBob, you can't just go around taking people's precious jewels!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was just doing what you told me.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[groans], Don't worry about it. Just tell me where you got them gems from.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, upstairs. I went left, then right, then double and triple right, then down, up, and right 18 more times. Then do four somersaults, a barrel roll, jump backwards twice, spin till you get sick... ,[gags], And you're there.
,[Silence.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay. ,[walks off with the jewels],
,Patrick:, Fancy foods! Get your fancy foods here!
,[One high-class guest takes a patty and eats it. As he eats it, jewels are sticking to his teeth.],
,Guest 1:, Delicious.
,Patrick:, I love delicious stuff. My turn!
,[Patrick eats a patty and a jewel stuck to his tooth.],
,Patrick:, Yummy.
,Guest 2:, I'll take a slice of that.
,Patrick:, Mine! ,[growls],
,[Patrick bites the hand on another high-class guest.],
,Guest 3:, Ouch!
,[Patrick barks like a dog and eats the plate full of Krabby Pâtés like a wild animal. The scene changes to Squidward serving Krabby Pâtés in a different room.],
,Squidward:, Who wants food? I'm a mindless drone with food. Working for the man. Huh?
,[Squidward notices a band playing for the party and sees one member playing the clarinet.],
,Squidward:, Ooh. ,[his eyes fall out on the Krabby Pâtés],
,[A guest behinds Squidward clears her throat as she demands to hand her a slice of the Krabby Pâtés.],
,Squidward:, Here you go, princess.
,[Squidward shoves the plate full of patties into the guests mouth as his eyes stick to her head. Squidward chuckles as he sees his chance to be a musician. Squidward snatches the clarinet player and steals his clarinet. He then goes up on the stage.],
,Squidward:, Let's do this thing.
,[Squidward plays through the clarinet, but plays notes that are off-key. The band finds this annoying and takes a step to the right.],
,Squidward:, Hey, where are you going?
,[Squidward tries it again, but the band steps off the stage.],
,Squidward:, Oh, down here.
,[Squidward tries it again, but the band runs back on the stage.],
,Squidward:, I never heard of a marching quintet.
,[Squidward tries it again, but the band has had enough and decides to run away from Squidward.],
,Squidward:, Uh, wait for me. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. Wait, wait— ,[squeaks with his clarinet], Hey, hey! ,[squeaks some more],
,[Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is in the hallways upstairs, trying to find the place to return the jewels.],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, what did he say? 18 rights, then four lefts, or five? Ooh.
,[Billy appears in Mr. Krabs' pants again.],
,Billy:, I want my birthday cake!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams], Oh, you—get off! Enough of this! ,[pulls Billy off his face],
,Billy:, If you don't get me my birthday cake, I'll set off all these fireworks!
,[Billy holds out a handful of fireworks, which frightens Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Give me those! Young boy like yourself shouldn't be playing with fireworks. They're too dangerous.
,Billy:, Gosh, no one ever cared enough about me to explain that. It's like you're my real father. ,[teary eyed], May I hug you?
,[Billy hugs Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh.
,Ms. Mildred:, ,[voiceover], Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams], Oh, uh, quick, in here! ,[stuffs Billy in the laundry chute],
,Billy:, Why, father? Why?
,Ms. Mildred:, ,[voiceover], Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Um, yes, ma'am?
,Ms. Mildred:, ,[voiceover], Mr. Krabs, we seem to be having some problems with the food service.
,Patrick:, Mine, mine!
,[Patrick takes a patty out of a guest's mouth and eats it.],
,Patrick:, Mine, mine!
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, I'll be right down to have a look. Just need to find something here. All right, where was I? Four somersaults and a barrel roll, I think.
,[Mr. Krabs does some somersaults on the floor and rolls down the hallway. Patrick roars like a gorilla and jumps onto a table. He growls at the guests until SpongeBob shows up to calm the wild starfish down.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, no! The food is for the guests!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick do a tug-of-war with the patty until Patrick lets go of the patty. The patty is sent flying into Squidward's clarinet.],
,Squidward:, What the—?
,[Squidward blows the patty out of the clarinet.],
,Nathiel Waters:, So then, I was all like— ,[gets hit by the patty], Oof! Well, I never!
,Guest 4:, Food fight!
,[All of the guests at the party get into a food fight and throws food everywhere.],
,Ms. Mildred:, Oh, my.
,[Meanwhile upstairs, Mr. Krabs spins towards the door of Ms. Mildred's room.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa. ,[belches], This must be the place. ,[enters Ms. Mildred's room], Hello? Ooh.
,[In the middle of the room, there is a large water bed.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh-ee. That is one big—water bed?
,[Mr. Krabs touches the bed and it ripples up to the top. On top of the bed, Billy is up there bouncing on it.],
,Billy:, Birthday cake!
,Mr. Krabs:, Dogfish!
,Billy:, Hi, Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't call me that! And stop jumping on that water bed! You'll pop it!
,Billy:, Okay, Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[climbs up to the top], Get over here!
,[Mr. Krabs jumps on the bed to grab Billy, but misses.],
,Billy:, Hah, Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Why, you little—
,[Mr. Krabs jumps on the bed to grab Billy, but misses again. Mr. Krabs growls and tries to catch Billy. However, his pointy feet pop the water bed, much to Mr. Krabs' horror.],
,Billy:, Whoa, whoa, whoa!
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-oh!
,Billy:, Whoa, whoa, whoa!
,[The water bed explodes water. Meanwhile downstairs, the guest are continuing with their food fight.],
,Ms. Mildred:, Stop it, everyone! You're ruining my par— ,[gets food thrown in her face], Oh, no, you did not!
,[Ms. Mildred throws dozens of food at her barbaric guests. Mr. Krabs is upstairs, trying to escape the flooding water.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Barrel roll, four somersaults!
,[Mr. Krabs does some somersaults as the torrent of water flows down the hallway.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Look out, flood's a-coming!
,[Ms. Mildred is busy throwing food at the guests as SpongeBob is sweeping the floor.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice doing business with you!
,Ms. Mildred:, Come back here!
,[The flood engulfs the entire room. SpongeBob doesn't take notice of it until he sees it coming towards him.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[screams],
,[He gets engulfed in the floods as well. Ms. Mildred chases Mr. Krabs across the hall until she gets engulfed in the flood. Mr. Krabs slips on some food and is sent flying in the air.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa!
,[The lit candles on the chandelier ignites the fireworks and Mr. Krabs falls on the ground. He smells smoke and sees the fireworks being ignited.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no.
,[The fireworks send Mr. Krabs flying through the air. Several guests continue to food fight until they take notice of Mr. Krabs flying past them.],
,Guests:, Ooh!
,[The flood comes in and engulfs them as well. Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Patrick run out of the mansion. The mansion explodes with water and sends a tidal wave flowing out. Billy is surfing on Mr. Krabs' check.],
,Billy:, Yay! ,[gets splattered with his birthday cake], My cake!
,Mr. Krabs:, My check!
,Ms. Mildred:, My party!
,[SpongeBob, who is a bouncing house again, is surfing on the tidal wave. Ms. Mildred and several kids from Billy's party are bouncing on him. SpongeBob laughs as the tidal wave carries everyone off into the sunset. One kid, who is still holding onto the balloon rock, floats by and continues screaming.],

"SpongeBob:, ,[has Krabby Patty meat in a container], Ooh... delicious!
,[He blows out more Krabby Patties onto a nearby table and puts them all into the freezer, then rolls up the leftover meat into a top hat then puts it on.],
,SpongeBob:, (British accent) Top of the morning to ya! ,[laughs, then makes the meat into a version of Gary and it meows. Then makes the meat into a telephone and answers it], Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking! ,[laughs again but the telephone suddenly starts to ring and answers it], Gary? Is that you? ,[pause], Gary, I know you're there. I can hear you breathing! ,[hangs the phone up then makes the meat into a hot dog-like shape and gasps], Ooh! ,[boils the meat in water on the stove],
,Narrator:, One wiener later...
,SpongeBob:, ,[enters Mr. Krabs' office holding the hot dog], Mr. Krabs! This wiener tastes just like a Krabby Patty! Maybe we could add them to the menu?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm not impressed...
,SpongeBob:, I made it with leftover ingredients.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now I'm impressed!
,Frank:, ,[enters the Krusty Krab and walks to the empty cash register], Hmm... I could've sworn that sign said ""Open.""
,Squidward:, ,[outside], Sigh... Once in a while, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life... Talking to myself... again...
,SpongeBob:, ,[showing Mr. Krabs how to make a Krusty Dog], And then I just cooked it like this!
,Mr. Krabs:, Go on.
,Frank:, My! What an interesting shape! Are those for sale?
,Mr. Krabs:, Why? Would you like to buy one?
,Frank:, Well, that would depend on the price.
,Mr. Krabs:, Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?
,Frank:, Hmm... sure, I suppose so!
,Mr. Krabs:, How about double?
,Frank:, Now you're talking!
,Customer:, Krabby Patties again? ,[sighs], If only there were something else... ,[notices Frank eating a Krusty Dog], Hey, whatcha got there Frank?
,Frank:, It's new! Tastes just like a Krabby Patty, but it's shaped like a wiener! ,[walks off],
,All three customers:, That sounds interesting!
,Dave:, ,[talking to SpongeBob], Hey! I'd like to request a wiener!
,Two customers:, Me too!
,All three customers:, Wieners! Wieners! Wieners!
,[Mr. Krabs climbs up to the menu sign and writes ""Krusty Dogs"" on it in red chalk],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, what's that noise?
,Squidward:, Excruciating.
,Mr. Krabs:, Up here, boy! Take a look!
,SpongeBob:, I can't read it from here, Mr. Krabs! What's it say?
,Mr. Krabs:, It says ""Krusty Dogs, only $3.99!"" Or $4.99 with cheese!
,Squidward:, $4.99!? That's highway robbery!
,Mr. Krabs:, Avec fromage, Monsieur Squidward. Avec fromage.
,SpongeBob:, My Krusty Dog! Handwritten on the menu! Oh, pinch me Squidward!
,Squidward:, Pinch yourself, you ninny.
,Narrator:, The following day...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs to SpongeBob holding a ticket], SpongeBob! Three more Krusty Dogs! Pronto!
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye Captain! ,[dumps three Krusty Dogs in a pan of hot water],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! Three more orders of Krusty Dogs! Extra Krusty!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Mr. Krabs! We sure are gettin' a lot of orders for Krusty Dogs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yep!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I'll get those going right after I finish cooking up these Krabby Patties!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, forget about making those patties! Just make the wieners! ,[gives SpongeBob the ticket],
,SpongeBob:, Just make the wieners? ,[follows Mr. Krabs who is holding a ladder], Um, excuse me, Mr. Krabs? Uh, w-where are you going with that ladder? Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm just going to make a few changes to the Krusty Krab menu, that's all.
,SpongeBob:, Changes...?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that reminds me! Do you have an eraser I could borrow?
,SpongeBob:, Eraser?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[on top of the ladder], Ah, never mind. I'll just cross it off. ,[uses the chalk to mark out ""Krabby Patties""], No more Krabby Patties!
,SpongeBob:, ,[shocked], No more Krabby patties...,[passes out, then two paramedics put a breathing mask on him],
,Paramedic 1:, Okay, just breathe normally, son.
,SpongeBob:, No more Krabby patty…
,Paramedic 1:, There you go. That's it.
,Paramedic 2:, There! He's startin' to revive.
,SpongeBob:, I had this horrible dream that Mr. Krabs was never gonna let me cook Krabby Patties again. ,[sees Mr. Krabs pushing his grill out from the kitchen, much to his shock],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pardon me.
,SpongeBob:, ,[falls on the floor crying],
,Paramedic 2:, We're losin' 'im!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs throws grill into trash heap],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[zoomed in on Mr. Krabs eyes], SpongeBob. SpongeBob. Wake up. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[being held in the two paramedics arms], Where am I? And what are these paramedics doing here?
,Mr. Krabs:, You're back in yer old kitchen. And the pair of paramedics were here to revive ye.
,SpongeBob:, I was asleep?
,Kr. Krabs:, Yea, but just for a little while, so I only docked your pay for the time you were unconscious.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks over at the empty space where the grill used to be], Mr. Krabs, isn't that where the grill used to be? ,[points to empty space],
,Mr. Krabs:, Maybe. But now we have this! ,[unveils a small hot dog cooker],
,SpongeBob:, And what about my... my spatula? ,[tears fill his eyes],
,Mr. Krabs:, I gotcha a new one! ,[lifts up hot dog holder],
,SpongeBob:, ,[catches hot dog holder, accidentally pinching his nose with it],
,Mr. Krabs and the paramedics:, ,[laugh at SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright! Those wieners aren't going to rotisserie themselves. Everybody back to work.
,Mr. Krabs and paramedics:, ,[walk away], ,[Mr. Krabs pushes the hot dog cooker up to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, captain. ,[he sadly taps the small cooker with the hot dog holder],
,SpongeBob:, ,[approaches Squidward], Squidward, can I talk to you for one second?
,Squidward:, I don't know. That's a pretty long talk. 
,SpongeBob:, Has anything ever happened at your job that made it... not as fun as it used to be?
,Squidward:, Actually, yes.
,SpongeBob:, Really?! What was it? 
,Squidward:, Being hired. 
,SpongeBob:, I don't know why, but things aren't just the same after Krusty Dogs were added to the menu. 
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, my boy, I realized long ago that there is nothing, I repeat, nothing, that could make this job any more boring, or humiliating, or demeaning that it already is. 
,Squidward:, ,[wearing hot dog suit outside Krusty Krab], 
,Billy:, Look at that guy dressed like a hot dog, Mommy. 
,Mom:, Let that inspire you to stay in school, Billy. 
,Billy:, ,[runs back and kicks Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, ,[approaches Mr. Krabs, who is hammering a sign to a support beam], Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy SpongeBob! How goes the wieners?
,SpongeBob:, Eh, I was kinda wondering... could we just go back to selling Krabby Patties?
,Mr. Krabs:, What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever, boy!
,SpongeBob:, I know. Well, I guess I sorta miss the Krabby Patties. After all, they're what gave this place its name.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, good point.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! Don't you think that we should… ,[SpongeBob watches Mr. Krabs dash outside and change the sign to ""The Krusty Dogs], Krusty Dog?! Those wieners have got to go!
,SpongeBob:, ,[serves Abigail-Marge and Dale their hot dogs], Here you go, hungry customers, your delicious Krusty Dogs!
,Abigail-Marge:, They do look delicious!
,SpongeBob:, Yes! ,[whispers into her ear], Eat one and you'll develop an unsightly skin condition.
,SpongeBob:, ,[approaches another customer], Here's your footlong, sir! 
,Jimmy:, Thanks! 12 inches of deliciousness!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! You know what gives them that added flavor?
,Jimmy:, No, what?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers into ear],  Nose hairs and recycled dental floss.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, We have gotta get rid of these wieners and bring back the Krabby Patty!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I never thought I'd be saying this, but... count me in!
,SpongeBob:, Hurray!
,Squidward:, ,[bursts into Krusty Krab], Help! I'm having terrible abdominal pain! I think it was the... the... ,[looks over at SpongeBob], Line?
,SpongeBob:, Wiener. 
,Squidward:, The wiener!
,SpongeBob:, ,[dressed in a brown coat and beard], Ladies and gentlemen! Allow me to introduce myself. I am but a simple, old-timey gentlemen. I came here for one purpose today.
,Mable:, So I said, it didn't smell so bad, but it tastes aw-
,SpongeBob:, Quiet, Granny, I'm talking!
,Mable:, Oh.
,SpongeBob:, And that is to loudly decry these modern, new-fangled days of wieners, and to band for a return to a simpler time. A Krabby Pattier time! ,[looks at customers], 
,Sadie:, I'm not really conceded about possible ill-health effects. How about you guys?
,Clay:, Eh.
,Dennis:, How about nostalgia? 
,Sadie:, Never heard of it. ,[continues eating],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, that didn't work at all.
,Squidward:, It only seemed to increase their appetite for wieners.
,SpongeBob:, We need stronger tactics. 
,Squidward:, Right, something that would make Mr. Krabs' whole wiener thing blow right up in his face! 
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, blow up. ,[facial expression changes to happy], Squidward, that's it! ,[skips and laughs away], 
,SpongeBob:,  ,[grabs balloons from a drawer, puts one in a Krusty Dog], Beautiful.
,SpongeBob:,  ,[serves to customer with a air pump connected to the Krusty Dog], Your Krusty Dog, sir, with extra mustard. 
,Nat:, Thanks. 
,SpongeBob:, Can I bring you something else? ,[silence], Okay, I guess not. Thank you sir. ,[walks away], 
,Nat:, ,[picks up Krusty Dog, slowly starts bringing it to his mouth],
,SpongeBob:, ,[watches customer], Wait for it SpongeBob. Wait for it. Now! ,[pushes down on air pump, filling up the balloon, and the hot dog],
,Sadie:, Yeah, remember that, that was... Oh, my Neptune! ,[sees hot dog expanding], That Krusty Dog is about to explode!
,Nat:, What? Where? ,[Krusty Dog explodes, shooting meat on all the customers],
,All customers:, ,[begin screaming and angrily leaving],
,SpongeBob:, Have a nice day! 
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! What happened in here? Where all me customers?! What are we gonna do?
,SpongeBob:, Oooh! I know the answer.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pops in window looking at SpongeBob grilling Krabby Patties], Hey, SpongeBob! Have you seen Mr. Squidward? 
,SpongeBob:, I think he's outside on his break.
,Mr. Krabs:, Perfect! And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy! 
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, captain! 
,Squidward:, ,[standing outside Krusty Krab in a Krabby Patty suit, waving a sign saying ""THEY'RE BACK!],. 
,Billy:, Mom, look! It's a guy dressed as a Krabby Patty! 
,Mom:, It's never too soon to start picking a good college, Billy. ,[runs back and kicks Squidward to the ground], 
,Squidward:, Well, I guess I was wrong again. It can always get more humiliating.

"[First scene at Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, one extra large order of sea fries.
,SpongeBob:, And...
,Squidward:, Please.
,SpongeBob:, Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?
,Squidward:, Yes. Yes it was.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Snaps finger], One large sea fries coming up! ,[Walks to pick up a bag full of sea taters. Pours them into his holes then walks back. Strains himself and the fries comes out of him and into the fryer. A bonk in the head gets one more out], ,[fryer dings!], Eeeeeee! ,[Picks up fries and places them on the container. Gives them to Squidward],
,Squidward:, One large sea fries. Extra weird.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[A megaphone appears], SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob's facial parts fall out], Report to me office.
,[Cut to Mr. Krabs's office],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now listen up, son. I called ye here on the official Krusty Krab business. Every year, me fellow cheapskate crabs meet and discuss new ways of being stinky in the workplace. But more than that, they bestow the award for Cheapest Krab. And this year, ,[holds up paper], I've been nominated!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Reads paper and speaks gibberish],...Krabs...,[gibberish],...nominated...,[gibberish],...award...award?
,Mr. Krabs:, So I'll be outta town for the awards ceremony. And yer coming with me.
,SpongeBob:, Road... trip!
,[They exit the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, this trip... I'm gonna teach ye all the cheapskate knowledge like you were the son I've never wanted!

,SpongeBob:, ,[peels his head off, revealing his brain], Can do, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, And in the tradition of the event, we are required to travel cheaply, and I'm gonna teach ya the cheapest way to do it!
,[Cut to a hotel where all the cheapskates are meeting. A mailman drops a heavy envelope on the front desk. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob come out],
,Mr. Krabs:, Attention, cheapskate attendees! I, Eugene Krabs, have only spent on me travel, the price of a one-cent stamp! ,[The crabs start cheering], Thank you! Thank you! I'd like to see someone top that!
,[Suddenly, another crab comes out of a suitcase],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasp], Chintzy McGee?!
,Chintzy McGee:, Thanks for letting me hitch your ride, Mr. Krabs! I didn't have to spend a penny on travel!
,Crabs:, Oooh! ,[One of them says, ""Snap!"" and snaps his finger],
,Chintzy McGee:, ,[To SpongeBob], Better wish him luck, kid. He'll need it. ,[Leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Good luck, Mr. Krabs- ,[Mr. Krabs grabs his mouth],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on. ,[Leaves],
,[Cut to hotel room door. An employee carries their bags to their hotel room],
,Employee:, Your room, sir. ,[Holds out hand],
,Mr. Krabs:, You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate: ,[whispers], He wants a tip.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Whispers], What's a tip?
,Mr. Krabs:, It means he wants money for nothing. ,[pulls out a quarter with a string attached to it], So watch closely. ,[Drops it on employee's hand], There ye are, lad.
,Employee:, Wow. A quarter. You, sir, are a real cheapskate.
,Mr. Krabs:, Why, thank you! ,[Employee walks away], Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back! ,[pulls on string. The quarter flies away from the employee's hand],
,Employee:, Oh. Like I haven't seen that gag ten times today. ,[quarter flies back to Mr. Krabs's hand, who laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Go ahead! Give it a try!
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, sir! ,[pulls out another quarter], Here you are, sonny! A nice, shiny- ,[turns to see another employee, who is very big and ugly], quarter. ,[SpongeBob gives it to him, who grapples tightly onto the quarter, then leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, Go on, boy! The quarter's getting away!
,[SpongeBob pulls the string, but lures the big employee back to him, and squashes him, the big employee gets up, and he is stuck to his butt],
,Mr. Krabs:, Quit foolin' around! I got an award to win! ,[He pulls SpongeBob out and leaves],
,SpongeBob:, My quarter! ,[the big employee leaves with the quarter stuck to his butt],
,[They walk into a room full of cheapskate crabs who are chatting],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hi, fellers! ,[He laughs, the crowd laughs, and SpongeBob attempts to laugh like them],
,One of the crabs:, Ye still know the cheapskate handshake?
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course. ,[They start the handshake],
,Both:, Penny pinchin', penny pinchin'. ,[They pinch each other's butts, then act like chickens], Cheep cheep cheep! ,[They peck the ground, then sighed],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'd like to introduce me fellow fry cook, SpongeBob. I've been giving some pointers.
,Crab:, Ah! Training in the cheapskate arts, eh? Yer learning from the master, kiddo!
,SpongeBob:, I cook Krabby Patties.
,Crab:, Yes. Sure you do. Later, Krocs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Lad, you're surrounded by stingy wisdom, so try to pick up some pointers. But whatever you do, don't lend anyone money. ,[He sees SpongeBob lending money to a crab],
,SpongeBob:, Twenty five, twenty six- ,[They both see Mr. Krabs. The crab then walks away with the cash],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's mangle.
,Judge:, Attention, penny pinchers! ,[pinches his claw],
,Crabs:, ,[confused, then pinches their claws. Laughter],
,Judge:, It's time to award the trophy ,[pulls out trophy], for this year's Cheapest Crab! ,[The golden trophy shows a claw pinching a penny],
,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob sit down to watch a video],
,Judge:, And the nominees are: Eugene Krabs! In: ""Sign of the Times!""
,[The video shows Mr. Krabs putting out a ""Free Krabby Patties"" sign. Audience gasps. customers comes to Krusty Krab. Another sign is put out],
,Crowd:, ""Huh?"" ""A dollar per footstep?"" ""I can't afford that!"" ,[they're confused],
,Harold:, How do I get out of here? ,[He, along with others, struggle not to walk too much. Mr. Krabs laughs. Applause],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thank you, thank you!
,Judge:, Next up is Buford Bargain Bottom in: ""Convenience Store Caper!""
,[Video shows a customer walking to Buford, the cashier, with a bag of chips. Buford scans it three times],
,Customer:, Uh, you charged me three times.
,Buford:, Yeah. Three times the flavor, three times the price! ,[Applause],
,Judge:, And Dwight T. Wad in: ""Tying Up Loose Ends!""
,[Video shows Wad tying used toilet paper to a roll of new toilet paper. Applause],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, geez. I didn't think the competition would be so stiff this year! ,[To SpongeBob], I'm gonna need your help on this one! ,[Runs to whisper something to the judge],
,Judge:, Well, that's highly unconventional, but okay. We will now hear a testimony from a Krusty Krab employee! ,[Mr. Krabs gets SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'... ,[his eyelids move twice. SpongeBob winks. Mr. Krabs winks four times. wink. two eyelids and a wink. wink], Ye not getting it, are ye? ,[SpongeBob shakes his head], Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Gasp], You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?
,SpongeBob:, No. ,[he is pushed onto the stage],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win! ,[Throws SpongeBob to the mic],
,SpongeBob:, ,[speaks through mic], Um, uh, uh, uh... Mr. Krabs has always been very, uh... very...very red.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Slap], Exaggerate!
,SpongeBob:, Blue!
,Mr. Krabs:, No! About me being cheap!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous pointer. ,[The audience gasps, including Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!
,SpongeBob:, Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees. ,[The crabs talk to each other about this], Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks. ,[Mr. Krabs faints],
,Judge:, We've heard enough. ,[pushes SpongeBob away, points to Mr. Krabs on the floor], Disqualified!
,[Cut to hotel room. Mr. Krabs is packing up, but also sobbing into his suitcase],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Mr. Krabs, you left some bitter tears on the night vent.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Sniff], Thanks. ,[Puts tears in suitcase],
,SpongeBob:, Cheer up, Mr. Krabs. You may have not won the award, but you taught this sponge a lot about stinginess. Ooh! I almost forgot to pack these hotel toiletries! ,[Puts them away], And let's not forget these hotel towels! ,[Puts them away],
,Mr. Krabs:, But...but isn't that stealing?
,SpongeBob:, Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh heh. Well, could we ""exaggerate"" this pillow, too?
,SpongeBob:, Well, only if you help me ""exaggerate"" this air conditioner!
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure, boy! But why not ""exaggerate"" the whole wall? ,[They laugh, then start taking the room and its walls apart. They exit with their huge suitcases full of parts of the room], Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy. ,[They laugh again],
,[Cut to lobby],
,Employee:, Do you have any hotel property in this bag?
,Judge:, Preposterous! This is all mine! ,[Pats his suitcase, which opens and reveals hotel property. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob pull their bags in],
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh heh heh. Looks like he bit off more than he could chew. ,[The bags explode, revealing the hotel room like it was],
,Judge:, ,[Gasp], You took the entire hotel room?
,SpongeBob:, Duh! ,[Wags finger], Exaggerated! ,[The crabs give an applause],
,Judge:, That is the stingiest display I've ever seen. I declare you the new winner! ,[gives trophy to Mr. Krabs, who laughs], See ye next year! ,[exits, then pulls on a string. The trophy flies back to him, then he leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[doesn't care and talks to SpongeBob], Thanks for ruinin' everything so I could win! Put er there, SpongeBob, me boy!
,SpongeBob:, Sure. ,[holds out hand. SpongeBob holds out his hand, but chopped SpongeBob's hand off.],
,SpongeBob:, Oops. ,[They laugh],

"Narrator:, It is a cold and windy day, and Bikini Bottom is covered with goosebumps.
,Squidward:, Oh, it's freezing in here.
,SpongeBob:, Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. my buns are nice and toasty. ,[turns around to show two Krabby Patties on his butt],
,Squidward:, I'm so glad I don't eat ""here"" ,[SpongeBob, Squidward, and the Krabby Patties shiver as a gusty wind blows through again], Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway? ,[looks at the thermostat to show 62°], 62°? Oh, that cheapskate! I'm going to start it to a toasty 63. ,[turns it to 63° but an alarm goes off], Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hears alarm, bursts down his door], ,WHO TOUCHED ME THERMOSTAT?!?!?!, ,[everyone, including SpongeBob points at Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[at SpongeBob], Oh, thanks a-- ,[Mr. Krabs grabs him by the nose],
,SpongeBob:, You're welcome, Squidward.
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, you're always going on about your book club. Read this.
,Squidward:, ,[reads sign above thermostat], ""Do not touch thermostat ever."" ,[Mr. Krabs puts the temperature back on 62°],
,Mr. Krabs:, Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!
,Squidward:, That's totally selfish!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!
,Mr. Krabs:, What?! ,[kids are playing ball, flying kites and jumping rope in Mr. Krabs front yard], Hey, you kids get off of my lawn! ,[Mr. Krabs runs out of the restaurant. Plankton is watching all of this through a straw],
,Plankton:, That's right. Run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it using your thermostat! ,[laughs maniacally until an alarm goes off], What the--? Oh, no. Code red! Abandon ship! ,[Plankton screams as Old Man Jenkins sucks him through the straw and into his belly], No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge. ,[laughs manically],
,[Mr. Krabs flips the sign to CLOSED, which means closing time after their work day. SpongeBob and Squidward wait as Mr. Krabs locks the doors],
,Squidward:, I'm going to go recover from hypothermia.
,SpongeBob:, Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?
,Mr. Krabs:, It means that he's a big fat cry baby.
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[flushes the toilet and walks to the doors but can't get out], Locked in again.
,Plankton:, That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place. ,[turns on sink faucet], Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs. It's just business. ,[opens up the freezer], Well, maybe it is personal. ,[turns down the thermostat to –15°], I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat! ,[cut to Mr. Krabs house where he is sleeping],
,Mr. Krabs:, Someone—touching—thermostat. ,[cut to next day with Squidward and SpongeBob walking to work],
,Squidward:, I might need to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday.
,SpongeBob:, That's why I wore mittens. ,[wearing a mitten on each eyelash], Mm. Toasty!
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[The Krusty Krab is frozen],
,Mr. Krabs:, Morning, boys. ,[taps the frozen lock with his key], Lock's a bit sticky this morning. ,[the key breaks a hole in the frozen lock, opens doors to see the whole place frozen], Is it cold in here, or is it just me? Well, get to work. ,[goes into his office],
,Squidward:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. ,[slips and slides all over the place, including into Squidward], Pardon me. ,[Squidward slides into Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, quit clowning around and get to work.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir.
,Squidward:, As long as you turn the heat up.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[points to a poorly-taped piece of paper reading ""62°"" obscuring the actual temperature display], The temperature stays at 62 degrees.
,Squidward:, There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't care if Santie Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones. Don't... touch... the thermostat! ,[icicles fall down and SpongeBob and Squidward run],
,Plankton:, ,[spying through his telescope, while The Chum Bucket has a sign that says ""72° Warm!""], I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder. ,[customers are waiting for food but Squidward can't move with a tray of Krabby Patties in his hand],
,Mr. Krabs:, Quit your lollygagging and get a move on. ,[gives Squidward a forceful push; Squidward slips and falls, tossing the patties off the plate],
,Squidward:, Order up.
,Martin:, Let's get out of here.
,Plankton:, Yes, flee that frozen wasteland. Warmth and joy have left your lives. ,[his giant telescope looks at a fish walking by], Hey, buddy. you want to eat The Chum Bucket? ,[Jimmy runs off screaming], Fine! At least Krabs' place is deserted. Hey! The customers are coming back. ,[customers are walking into the Krusty Krab with warmer clothes on], I don't understand. What's bringing them back? ,[SpongeBob is skating on frozen patties], What the--?
,Mr. Krabs:, Just put those patties back when you're done.
,SpongeBob:, Can do, Mr. Krabs.
,Squidward:, I'm really glad I don't eat here.
,SpongeBob:, Order up!
,Frankie:, Where's my food? ,[patty enters his mouth], Mm. ,[other patties enter everyone else's mouths],
,Old Man Jenkins:, I want my Krabby Flabby!
,SpongeBob:, Coming right up, sir. ,[SpongeBob hits a patty off of Squidward's behind and into Old Man Jenkins' mouth, sending him into the wall and sliding onto the floor],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Delicious! ,[everyone cheers],
,Abigail Marge:,  Wow, that looks like fun. I'll have two Krabby Patties, but don't cook them.
,Jimmy:, I'll have two frozen Krabby Patties, too.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir.
,Clay:, I want Patty skates!
,Man:, I want patties, now.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's beautiful. I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook them. This is the happiest, and most cost-effective day of me whole life. ,[hugs all the money],
,Plankton:, No! How is this possible? I freeze this place solid and he turns it into an ice rink. He's making more money than ever.
,Karen:, That's because, unlike you, he's a good businessman.
,Plankton:, Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings.
,Karen:, I don't understand why you don't just steal a Krabby Patty in all that confusion.
,Plankton:, I'll be right back. ,[chuckles],
,Karen:, I don't know why I encourage him. ,[inside The Krusty Krab, people are ice skating, playing hockey and riding the clamboni],
,Mr. Krabs:, This is fantastic. The local hockey team is paying me to practice here.
,SpongeBob:, Coming through! ,[skates by Patrick, who has his tongue stuck to the pole], Hi, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[mumbles], Hi, SpongeBob. ,[Gary, dressed as a referee, blows his whistle and throws the patty in the air. it hits the ground but slides towards the door],
,Hockey Player #1:, Where'd the puck go? ,[SpongeBob squints his eyes to see Plankton carrying the patty],
,SpongeBob:, Holy shrimp! Plankton! ,[flickers tongue in a battle cry],
,Plankton:, I did it. I finally got a Krabby Patty. ,[SpongeBob puts his spatula down to block Plankton],
,SpongeBob:, Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me, first.
,Hockey Player #1:, There's the puck. That little square guy has it.
,Hockey Player #2:, Get him. ,[SpongeBob tries to scurry but the hockey team tackles him. the other hockey player slapsticks the patty],
,SpongeBob:, You're mine now, Plankton! ,[patty flies into his face], You won't get away with this, Plankton.
,Plankton:, Hey, SpongeBob. long time, no see. What've you been up to? How was your weekend?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, my weekend was fabulous. Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug. ,[laughs], Swallowed a bug.
,Plankton:, Fascinating. Well, got to go. ,[takes patty and runs],
,SpongeBob:, Hey!
,Plankton:, Better luck next time, SpongeBob.
,Hockey Player #3:, There's the puck, eh? Get it.
,Plankton:, Uh-oh. ,[runs], Whoa! ,[Squidward skates by and dances in a yellow leotard. SpongeBob skates by him, he gets angry. the hockey team skates by him and runs him over],
,SpongeBob:, Hold it right there, mister! ,[two hockey players run into SpongeBob. Plankton tries running away again but gets hit by a hockey stick again. SpongeBob tries to get the patty but is getting hit by the hockey team over and over. Squidward is getting run over by everyone. Plankton gets hit towards the door],
,Plankton:, Yes, I'm going to make it. ,[lands in front of the door but when the hockey team and SpongeBob collide with each other, it sends Plankton and the patty into the air then back down],
,SpongeBob:, Got you, Plankton.
,Plankton:, On the contrary, It is I who has you. ,[rides the clamboni],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], The clamboni! ,[the clamboni runs into him, carrying him along],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs maniacally], Run, you fools. Run! ,[Plankton manages to take along the entire hockey team, SpongeBob, Squidward and Patrick on the clamboni], It's working. I'm actually going to get a Krabby Patty. ,[clamboni stops because of a huge pile up at the door], Come on, get out of the way! You're blocking the exit. ,[clamboni breaks down], No! No! ,[sobs],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll take that. ,[grabs patty], Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[jumps off the clamboni], You lose again, Plankton.
,Plankton:, I'm not giving up yet, Krabs. I've still got my secret weapon. ,[jumps on the thermostat], The thermostat! ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps softly], The thermostat.
,Plankton:, That's right, Krabs. It was I who froze The Krusty Krab. ,[rips off the paper that says ""62°"" to reveal -15°], See?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], You've gone too far this time, Plankton. You can pound me employees, ,[punches SpongeBob through the gut], try to destroy me restaurant, but nobody messes with me thermostat. ,[boxing bell rings as Mr. Krabs hurries over to Plankton but Plankton changes the thermostat to above boiling, making the ice melt. Mr. Krabs drops into the water, then Plankton turns it back to below freezing, which causes Mr. Krabs to freeze, too. The temperature now has -26°, having the numbers mixed up],
,Plankton:, See, Krabs, you can't defeat me. ,[turns the thermostat to hot and cold, making everyone freeze. accidentally lets go of the thermostat when its hot and drops into the water. Mr. Krabs walks up to the thermostat and changes it to freezing to turn Plankton into an ice cube. cut to later in the day where the ice rink has turned into a swimming pool for customers. SpongeBob in an inner tube floats to Mr. Krabs in a reclining chair with a Krabby Patty and lemonade in a platter],
,SpongeBob:, Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[takes the lemonade, but forgets the Krabby Patty], Thank you, lad. ,[sees Plankton in one of the ice cubes], Well, well, if it isn't Plankton. You know, I should thank you. What with the ice rink and now the swimming pool gimmick, I'm making more money than I ever did with the old Krusty Krab. Hey, you got any more good ideas? ,[takes a sip of his lemonade],
,Plankton:, ,[screams],

"[Open on the Chum Bucket. A clam crows like a rooster. Cut to a close-up of Plankton's face. He has his eye closed, and then slowly opens it to show its veins],
,Plankton:, ,[drearily], And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty. ,[Gets up and walks to his computer wife, Karen],
,Karen:, Maybe today will be the day?
,Plankton:, Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife. ,[Walks towards the doors of the Chum Bucket],
,Karen:, Do you even have a plan?
,Plankton:, Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen? ,[Bubbles rise, transitions to the Krusty Krab. Plankton walks through the door], I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula... ,[He slips and falls into a puddle of water],
,SpongeBob:, Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there. ,[Plankton tries to get up],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Walks towards them], Look at you, Plankton. Once again, you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula. ,[he holds a Krabby Patty in front of his face], Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula. ,[Plankton tries to bite it, but Mr. Krabs takes it away], And you never will! ,[laughs], How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure? ,[he walks away laughing, two customers are watching],
,Charlie:, ,[talking to the Nat Peterson next to him, commenting on the wet floor SpongeBob was mopping], There really should be a ""Wet Floor"" sign.
,Nat Peterson:, Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got.
,Plankton:, Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?
,Charlie:, Of course.
,Plankton:, ,[ponders the thought and then falls back and pretends to be injured], Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[bursting through his office's door], Sue?!
,Female Customer #1:, Oh, that looks bad.
,Dennis:, Uh-oh.
,Nazz:, Poor little man.
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter the frame and look at each other. Transition to ambulance workers pushing Plankton on a gurney],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?
,Plankton:, Well... if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.
,Mr. Krabs:, Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!
,Plankton:, ,[laughs menacingly, then points at Mr. Krabs], See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean... ,[stops pointing], Oh, the pain! The deep-frying pain! ,[The ambulance workers carry the gurney off and the scene transitions to the inside of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is pacing back and forth, with Squidward and SpongeBob near him],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.
,Mr. Krabs:, What I really need is a good lawyer.
,Richard:, Hello, did somebody say ""lawyer""? ,[Holds out his business card], Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.
,Mr. Krabs:, So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?
,Richard:, Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.
,[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into American dollar signs],
,Richard:, In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.
,[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into gold bars. The weight on them makes him fall over],
,Richard:, ,[points at Mr. Krabs], Does that happen a lot?
,SpongeBob:, No, they're usually silver.
,[Scene transitions to SpongeBob strolling into Mr. Krabs' office, humming his own theme song],
,SpongeBob:, Um, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, What is it, lad?
,SpongeBob:, I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a... ,[Richard whispers into his ear], of a liability than an asset.
,SpongeBob:, But I...
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places. ,[The lawyer grabs his briefcase and walks outside the door with it],
,Richard:, Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk! ,[he slips and falls on the floor],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!
,Richard:, ,[weakly], Wracked...with pain...can't move.
,SpongeBob:, But what about Mr. Krabs' case?
,Richard:, Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.
,SpongeBob:, But, I'm a...a liability.
,Richard:, Everything you need to win... ,[a part of his body snaps], is in this here case. ,[shows SpongeBob his briefcase],
,SpongeBob:, ,[swipes the case from him], Really? Everything?
,Richard:, Uh huh. Everything but a suit. ,[he falls unconscious],
,SpongeBob:, A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.
,[Scene changes to the Bikini Bottom Court House. Plankton in a wheelchair enters the courtroom and precedes to Mr. Krabs],
,Plankton:, ,[whispering], I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[yelling], Never, you little runt! ,[The court audience gasps],
,Plankton:, ,[dramatically], Oww, oww! My wittle arm! ,[audience gasps],
,Mr. Krabs:, What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.
,Plankton:, Oww! My other arm! ,[audience gasps],
,Mr. Krabs:, He's lying! Bah!
,[Judge's gavel knocks and the two proceed to their desk],
,Tom:, Court will come to order. The Honorable Judge Stickleback presiding.
,Stickleback:, Mr. Krabs, where is your attorney?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hesitantly], I don't know where he could be.
,[The courtroom door bursts open, with SpongeBob standing there in a gray suit, similar to the previous lawyer's],
,SpongeBob:, Here I am!
,Stickleback:, Thank you for joining us, Mr...uhh...
,SpongeBob:, ,[placing his briefcase on the desk], SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Through his teeth], What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here ,[rubs his briefcase], .
,Mr. Krabs:, Really?
,SpongeBob:, Yep, right in here. ,[tries to unlock the briefcase, but he can't],
,Mr. Krabs:, Is there a problem?
,SpongeBob:, Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination.
,Lawyer:, Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?
,Plankton:, Yes, your honor. I'll try. ,[Moves his wheelchair to the jury box. He ""owws"" in pain on the way there], I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today. ,[starts crying], I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.
,[SpongeBob tries to split the briefcase in half, but splits himself. Mr. Krabs leans over],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pull yourself together, boy.
,Plankton:, Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.
,Mr. Krabs:, How's it coming, lad?
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case. ,[takes a kitchen knife and tries to pry open the briefcase],
,Plankton:, Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor ,[SpongeBob continues with the knife], that had been intentionally ,[the knife shoots him to the light on the roof], covered with a viscous fluid.
,[SpongeBob puts a lamp shade on his head],
,SpongeBob:, Bombs away! ,[he drops onto the briefcase like a bomb, but nothing happens. SpongeBob drops off the desk and onto the floor],
,Plankton:, Ahem! Are you quite finished?
,SpongeBob:, ,[nods], Mm-hmm.
,Plankton:, Now where was I? Oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed. ,[he cries], ,I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram! Sorry!, ,[the audience begin to cry], Thank you for your kind attention. ,[he turns around and, softly], Suckers.
,Stickleback:, Does the defense... ,[sniffles], have an opening statement?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!
,[transitions to Mr. Krabs on the stand],
,Plankton:, ,[presents a ""wet floor"" sign to Mr. Krabs], Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?
,Mr. Krabs:, It's a ""wet floor"" sign.
,Plankton:, Do you own one?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't. ,[everyone gasps], No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed... superfluous.
,Court Audience:, Guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty.
,Plankton:, No more questions.
,[SpongeBob tries using a screwdriver to open the case],
,Stickleback:, Your witness, Mr. LawyerPants.
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,Stickleback:, Sometime today, Mr. Pants.
,SpongeBob:, May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap ,[Mr. Krabs starts sweating],, miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar ,[takes out a dollar], and dropped it in the blender? ,[drops the dollar in a blender], ,[Mr. Krabs gasps. SpongeBob presses the ""obliterate"" button on the blender. The dollar starts to be shredded],
,Mr. Krabs:, No! No-no! No! ,[runs and grabs the blender. He starts grabbing the piece of shredded dollar from the air], Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here. ,[the jury talks amongst themselves and SpongeBob tries to look innocent], A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain. ,[he walks off, but then walks back to pick up a stranded piece of dollar], Daddy didn't forget ya.
,Stickleback:, Does the defense have any witness to call?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[rests in his chair], Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee. ,[Squidward is up in the stand],
,SpongeBob:, Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?
,Squidward:, Yes.
,Mr. Krabs:, What?!
,SpongeBob:, Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?
,Squidward:, Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying? ,[the jury talks amongst themselves],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looking scared, he starts taking a nail and hammer and tries to open the briefcase], Must...open...case.
,[transition to SpongeBob questioning something else],
,SpongeBob:, So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it? ,[he's questioning the mop he was using, it doesn't speak],
,SpongeBob:, Answer the question! ,[the jury look at each other questioningly], Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm doomed.
,[Transition to SpongeBob still trying to open the briefcase],
,Mr. Krabs:, You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case. ,[he hits the case. The case then opens up], It's open! ,[they lift the case],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's... ,[shows that the thing inside the briefcase is a Krabby Patty], It's just his lunch. Or is it? ,[a light bulb moves out of SpongeBob's head and starts glowing],
,SpongeBob:, Defense calls Plankton to the stand. ,[Plankton looks surprised; later, on the stand],
,SpongeBob:, Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?
,Plankton:, To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?
,SpongeBob:, Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these? ,[he shows Plankton a Krabby Patty. Plankton starts licking his lips], Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty...
,Plankton:, ,[continuously sweating], Uhh...uhh...uhh ,[he tries to bite the sandwich, but SpongeBob takes it away. He takes off his fake casts], I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme! ,[jumps for the sandwich and grabs it, then he runs off with it], Yippee! Finally it's mine!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabbing the sandwich from Plankton], I'll take that!
,Plankton:, Huh? No, no, no!
,Mr. Krabs:, Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp. ,[he eats the Krabby Patty],
,Plankton:, No, no, no, no!
,Stickleback:, ,[bangs gavel], Has the jury reached a verdict?
,Tom:, We have, your honor. We find the defendant not guilty...but he is cheap.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.
,SpongeBob:, That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.
,Mr. Krabs:, A present? For me?
,SpongeBob:, Close your eyes and hold out your hand. ,[Mr. Krabs does so. SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs a ""wet floor"" sign with many nails in it. Mr. Krabs grabs it and starts yelling in pain], It's a ""wet floor"" sign. I made it myself.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cooking Krabby Patties.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Squidward hands him a slip], Another order? Okay! Get ready, Spaty! Time to grill up one more golden-piping hot Krabby Patt-wha? Double dipped milkshake? Gee! I haven't made one of those in awhile! ,[Pours milk and puts ice cream in a blender and turns it on using his elbow. Then comes out from the kitchen with the milkshake], Order up! ,[Walks over while putting whipped cream on top of the milkshake and walks over to Harold], One double dipped milkshake! ,[Harold is about to take a sip], Wait! I almost forgot! ,[Takes out a cherry from his pocket and puts it on top of the milkshake], Cherry on top! There you are, sir! A perfect double dipped milkshake! Enjoy!
,Harold:, Well! It looks delightful! ,[Takes a sip harder and harder only to suck his eyeballs through the straw. Then shoots them back into his eye sockets and notices the milkshake's frozen], This thing's frozen! ,[Smashes it down and breaks the table], BARNACLES! How am I supposed to drink this!? ,[Licks it], Gah! ,[Takes SpongeBob's hat, puts the frozen milkshake inside of it and then puts it back on SpongeBob's head], This shake is disgusting! ,[Smashes his hand down causing the milkshake to spray out of SpongeBob], Why, you probably don't even have a license to milkshake!
,SpongeBob:, A license to milkshake? Well, of course I do, silly! ,[Reaches into his pocket and shows Harold his milkshake license], And it doesn't expire until...,[Looks at his license and notices something],...seven years ago!?
,Harold:, Your milkshake license expired seven years ago!? Outrageous! I demand a refund!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Appears between SpongeBob and Harold], Hey, now! Let's not say things we might regret later! Tell you what, ,[Starts pushing Harold], you come back tomorrow and SpongeBob will make you a proper milkshake. ,[Pushes Harold out of the door], Alright! See you tomorrow! ,[Picks up SpongeBob and throws him into his boat],
,SpongeBob:, Where are we going, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm taking you back to school!
,[Bubble transition to a base with people running with jugs of ice cream on their backs saying ""One, two, three, four""],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Knocks SpongeBob out of his boat], There you are, boy! ,[Shows the Milkshake Academy], The Milkshake Academy! You know, boy? Milkshaking technology and know-how is advanced since you were last a cadet!
,SpongeBob:, I shall do my best, sir!
,[Bubble transition to SpongeBob in uniform beside five other cadets],
,Cadet 1:, Hey! Look! Up at the sea! ,[Notices a tough-looking fish blowing a horn then leaping down from an airplane getting closer as he, SpongeBob, and the other cadets salute to him], I don't think he's wearing a parachute!
,[The fish uses two whipped cream bottles to spray himself slowly and safely to the ground],
,Captain Frostymug:, At ease, cadets!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Licks off the whipped cream that is on him], Mmmm!
,Captain Frostymug:, Welcome to the Milkshake Academy! I'm your instructor: Captain Frostymug! Let's not beat around the bush here, boys! Your mamma's not here to wipe the whipped cream from your chinny-chin-chins! And I'm not here to help you with your bendy straws! My sole purpose is to transform you from mere guppies into cool, cold-drafted, chilled to the bone, ice cream blooded, licensed milkshake makin' guppies! But you must prove yourself worthy of this distinction! ,[Looks at SpongeBob], Do you consire youself worthy? Cadet Squarepants?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir! Worthy and ready!
,Captain Frostymug:, I see. Then this first test will be a breeze. What do you call ,[Takes out an ice cream scooper], this?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's easy! It's an ice cream spatula! ,[The other cadets laugh at SpongeBob],
,Captain Frostymug:, That's enough! This, Cadet Squarepants, is your scooper. The most vital weapon in the milkshaker's arsenal! It's clear that most of you understand the fundamentals. Now it's time to see what you can do! ,[Pounds his fist], Cadets! Man your milky, milky stations!
,[The other cadets start running around, then a bubble transition into a room with machines],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Walks up to one of the machines], A few more bells and whistles than I'm used to. But I think I can work with this! ,[Puts ice cream into a cup and tries to work the machine pushing a random button over and over again], Oh, dear! ,[Looks at the other cadets as they perfectly make their milkshakes],
,Captain Frostymug:, ,[Tastes one of the milkshakes], Fantastic! Nice and creamy mouth feel! ,[Notices SpongeBob randomly pressing a button], SquarePants appears to be having problems... again! You! Please explain where he has gone wrong!
,Cadet 2:, Sir, yes, sir! Sir! He is attempting to use the upper control panels to mix! Sir! Every cadet knows that these are telementry functions ,[Points to a button on a lower panel], And all of the controls are on the lower panel! Sir!
,SpongeBob:, Oh! That's right! Heh, how silly of me! Mr. Krabs' right. ,[Grabs the cup], Milkshaking has changed over the years. ,[Presses the button and starts to blend up a milkshake],
,Captain Frostymug:, Very good! But how does it taste? ,[SpongeBob turns off the machine and puts whipped cream on it and adds a cherry on top and gives it to him. He then lifts up the cup ready to taste it but it smashes him in the eye], Maybe we need to get back to basics...
,[Bubble transition back to Frostymug and SpongeBob],
,Captain Frostymug:, Listen up, Cadet Squarepants! If you want to make a milkshake, you gotta know how it feels to be a shake! ,[Shows a large, milkshake-shaped machine], Behold! The Shake Simulator! In you go! Now! March! Hut two three four! Hut two three four! Hut! ,[SpongeBob runs into the machine and Frostymug pushes a button causing another machine to lift SpongeBob up], Teach this upstart a lesson, I'm setting it to ""obliterate!"" ,[Turns the dial to obliterate which causes the other cadets to gasp],
,Cadet 2:, But sir! No one's ever survived ""obliterate!""
,Captain Frostymug:, Silence! He needs to learn cadet!
,[The machine starts shaking SpongeBob around and around until it stops],
,Captain Frostymug:, Now, let's see how the boy turned out! ,[Presses a button which causes the machine to pour out SpongeBob who fills up the cup],
,SpongeBob:, That was fun! Can I go again?
,[Captain Frostymug growls and another bubble transition to Frostymug beside a chalkboard],
,Captain Frostymug:, Never, in my thirty years of milkshake instruction, have I had such an unteachable moron! Cadets! Do you have any ideas on how to teach Cadet SpongeBob?
,Cadet 3:, You'd be better off teaching a hunk of coral, sir! ,[He and the other cadets laugh at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, I'll show you! I'll show you all I can make a milkshake! ,[Marches off. Bubble transition to SpongeBob riding a motorcycle to a sunset. Cue montage with the other cadets shooting cherries at the milkshake target. Cadet 2 succeeds and SpongeBob tries a go. He shoots the cherry but it shoots off the top and starts bouncing all over the place and eventually hits Captain Frostymug on his behind. Bubble transition to SpongeBob blending a milkshake, but it turns into a Krabby Patty. Bubble transition to SpongeBob playing volleyball with three other cadets. The volleyball lands in SpongeBob's mouth but he shoots it out through his head and starts to sweat. He then is handed a milkshake and drinks it and pours the rest on his head and he starts to slowly shake it off. Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Frostymug riding in airplanes. Frostymug opens his and holds out a cup. SpongeBob then pulls a level causing ice cream to come out but it misses the cup and lands in Frostymug's turbine causing his plane to catch on fire and crash but Frostymug safely floats down on a parachute. Bubble transition to the other cadets blending milkshakes and Frostymug drinking them using his bendy straw. They all succeed until he reaches SpongeBob and his milkshake bends Frostymug's straw. End montage and bubble transition to a ceremony room],
,Captain Frostymug:, When you first came to me just four short hours ago, you were nothing but a bunch of soda jerks! But now, you stand before me proud, mighty, milkshake makin' machines! It is with great pride I bestow upon you your milkshake operator license! Now, come up here and get them! ,[Starts handing out licenses and shaking the hands of the other cadets until he reaches SpongeBob], Well! I'm afraid there're aren't no more milkshake licenses. And do you know why?
,SpongeBob:, Um... the printer ran out of ink?
,Captain Frostymug:, No, you simpleton! There're aren't anymore milkshake licenses because YOU don't get one! ,[Pushes SpongeBob's mouth in],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Pulls out mouth], Why not?
,Captain Frostymug:, Hmm... let me see! ,[Walks over and grabs a cup], Maybe it's got something to do with the fact that you couldn't even get past Step #1 of making a milkshake: Filling the glass with ice cream!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Rushes over to the machine putting the cup under it], NO Captain Frostymug! I can do it! Let me show you! I just know I can! ,[Turns on the machine],
,Captain Frostymug:, No, here let me show you! ,[Grabs the cup], You're suppose to raise the cup to the spinny thing! ,[Starts suddenly sweating and looking nervous], Um, the...the spinny thing...
,[A time card that says ""Twenty Years Eariler"" is shown. It goes back to a shop that is called ""Milk Shake"" with a young Captain Frostymug],
,Customer:, Boy! I can't wait to have one of your renowned shakes Sir Frostymug!
,Young Frostymug:, You tried the rest, now prepare for the best! ,[Turns on the machine and the milkshake sprays on an electrical cord which causes the machine to spray milkshake on all of the customer's faces. They all start to scream and run all over the place], Nooooo!
,[Scene is back to older Frostymug],
,Captain Frostymug:, Nooo!
,SpongeBob:, What's wrong Captain Frostymug?
,Captain Frostymug:, I haven't touched a milkshake machine in twenty years! ,[Gets his arm caught in the blender], Dear Neptune's thunderclap! I'm stuck in the blender! Help!
,SpongeBob:, Captain Frostymug!
,Captain Frostymug:, ,[His whole body starts to slowly get sucked into the blender], ,[screaming], My arm! ,[screaming],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry sir! I'm coming! ,[Grabs onto Frostymug], Gotcha Captain!
,Captain Frostymug:, Save yourself boy! I'm a goner!
,SpongeBob:, No! I'm not leaving you behind! ,[Pulls Frostymug from the blender and the machine explodes. He then places Frostymug down],
,Captain Frostymug:, Thanks, SpongeBob! ,[Cough], You know, no one has ever treated this old captain with much kindness. And in return, I'd like to tell you a little secret. All these years, I've been able to make milkshakes without machines because making milkshakes really comes from within! Does that make sense?
,SpongeBob:, Not at all...
,[Bubble transition back to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, One milkshake, coming right up! ,[Tosses the ice cream into his body and starts shaking and pours the milkshake into the glass from his head, then whipped cream, then a cherry on top],
,Harold:, ,[Tastes it], You redeemed yourself SpongeBob! This is the BEST milkshake I'd ever had! ,[Other customers line up behind him with money],
,Mr. Krabs:, Where'd you learn those moves, SpongeBob?
,Captain Frostymug:, ,[Enters on a wheelchair], That would be from me! And in light of decent events, SpongeBob. I'd like to give you this ,[Hands SpongeBob his milkshake license],
,SpongeBob:, Gasp! My milkshake license! If only it were this easy to get a boating license! ,[Laughs],

,Patrick:, Not so fast, SpongeBob. What's in the secret room?
,SpongeBob:, It's not a secret room, Patrick. It's my library.
,Patrick:, W-what's that word mean?
,SpongeBob:, A library is a...playground for your mind. ,[pokes his brain out and pulls it back],
,[Patrick daydreams about playing on the playground with his brain.],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs and grabs the television], Let's do it! It's library time! ,[throws the television down the stairs],
,Sir Urchin and Snail Fail:, Ow! Ow! ,[crashes off-screen],
,Snail Fail:, What I do?
,[In the library, Gary is reading a ""Cooking without Salt"" cookbook. Patrick is laughing and kicks some pillows in a goofy fashion. He climbs on the ladder and rides around on it. He bumps into SpongeBob and lands on Gary's chair, scaring him. Gary angrily hisses at Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[straightens himself out], Oh, tender, naïve Patrick, it's not that kind of playground. It's a place to read books! See?
,Patrick:, Oh, I love books! ,[laughs and throws books around], Book! Book! ,[SpongeBob dodges the incoming books], Book!
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], Gary, I don't think Patrick knows how to use a book properly. ,[gets hit in the face by a book], Ow! ,[removes the book and grabs Patrick], Behold the books, Patrick. Each one has a story to tell.

,Patrick:, Whoa! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts a book close to his ear], Listen to the soothing sounds of the audiobooks. ,[hears seagulls cawing and ocean waves], I can hear the ocean.

,Patrick:, Me too!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.],
,SpongeBob:, Cookbooks, for the culinarily curious.
,[Patrick takes a page that has a picture of a turkey on it. He puts it on a stove, fries it up, and eats it.],
,Patrick:, I like the pictures.
,SpongeBob:, ,[reaches in Patrick's mouth and grabs the page], Ah, but the pictures are a mere snack! ,[closes the book and puts it away], It's the words in the book that really feeds your brain. Let's start you off with an old book. ,[takes an old book that is covered in cobwebs and dust; he parachutes down and opens the book; and eerie dust bunny appears and SpongeBob sniffs it up], Ah, musty old books smell. Now, read the words, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh, read the—oh, uh...""Once...Upon a..."" ""Once upon a..."" Once upon a what?!

,SpongeBob:, Then feast your eyes!

,Patrick:, Nonsense, dear boy. One can never accumulate too much information. ,[whips his face with a napkin], Ahem.
,SpongeBob:, Well, we're fresh out of books. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.
,Patrick:, Ah, I must confess to feeling more than slightly peckish.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm so proud of you! Ooh, you're a big brain now!

,Patrick:, Oh, skosh too big, it seems, eh, wha'?
,SpongeBob:, ""Eh, wha"" what?
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Oh, no matter, my plebeian friend. I shall simply exit posthaste, posterior-first. ,[attempts to exit backwards, but ends up getting stuck],
,SpongeBob:, I got it. ,[pushes Patrick],
,Patrick:, Careful.
,SpongeBob:, Little bit... ,[pushes Patrick], Wow. You really got your melon jammed in there, didn't you?
,Patrick:, Oh, true, SpongeBob. Eh, but we can easily solve this problem on a quantum physics level. Take this down. If we reduce my subatomic particles by way of orbital electromagnetism, we'll create a harmonic oscillation within the molecules, resulting in a wave-function collapse, which will enable my ""melon,"" as you so drolly put it, to slip out.
,[As Patrick spoke, simple mathematics appear from his head and swirl around SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, sure. Let's give it a try. ,[puts various parts together and creates a machine; he stick the suction plugs on to Patrick's head; then he creates sound waves to help shrink Patrick's head, but the waves bounce back and hit Gary, causing him to shrink and multiply into little snails], Gary! Speak to me. Oh... ,[gathers the little snails and forms Gary back to his normal self], Oh, Gary you're back. I'd know that slime anywhere. ,[gasps], Slime! That's it! ,[laughs], Slime it up, Gar-bear.
,[Gary slithers slime all over Patrick's head.],
,Patrick:, Abominable!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, that Gary grease ought to do it. Okay, Patrick, pull yourself out.

,[The fireplace builds up the fire. SpongeBob, dressed as a witchdoctor, screams like a chicken. Gary plays the drums in rhythm. Patrick's head is covered in lite candles. SpongeBob chants and dances around like he's performing a ritual. He opens the bottle, drinks the potion and spits it in Patrick's face. But instead of shrinking Patrick's head, SpongeBob's head shrinks.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[high-pitched], Oh, I give up! I'll guess we'll have to live here in the library forever, Gary.
,[Gary hides behind the drums in fear. SpongeBob cries a fountain of tears and his head goes back to normal.],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, your typically moronic attempt has given me the solution! Perhaps because I had to smarten up to get stuck...

,SpongeBob:, Whew. I hope this works.
,[Patrick sighs and SpongeBob turns on the television where the Sir Urchin and Snail Fail show is airing. Snail Fail hits Sir Urchin with a vase.],
,Sir Urchin:, Why you...!
,Snail Fail:, What I do? ,[hits the sea urchin with a shoe],
,Sir Urchin:, Why you...!
,Snail Fail:, What I do?
,Patrick:, I'm sorry, dear boy, but watching this mindless drivel isn't affecting me in the least...,[gets dazed and starts to drool],
,SpongeBob:, We've got drool! Patrick, it's working! ,[holds up the television],
,Snail Fail:, What I do?
,Patrick:, ,[his eyeballs rub against the screen], This is insulting my intelligence. ,[begins to laugh], And I adore it! ,[laughs enthusiastically],
,[Inside Patrick's head, Patrick's brain hears a loud noise. He turns and sees Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroying everything it built.],
,Snail Fail:, What I do? ,[hits Sir Urchin with a word],
,Sir Urchin:, ,[throws a chunk], Why you...!
,Snail Fail:, What I do? ,[hits Sir Urchin with a word],
,[Patrick's brain runs to hide somewhere as Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroy everything. Patrick's head shrinks down to its normal size.],
,SpongeBob:, We did it, Patrick! The mindless drivel is destroying your knowledge!
,[SpongeBob plugs a hose in Patrick's head and sprays the words back into the books. He sprays the words onto the shelves and form brand new books for his library. The hose spits out the last remaining words and Patrick's brain.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoops. Here, Patrick. You may need this little fella. ,[puts his brain back into Patrick's head],
,Patrick:, Huh? Ah.
,[Patrick's brain falls onto the couch in his head. It becomes bored again and picks its nose.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Patrick, this is where we came in. Ready for some ice cream?
,Patrick:, Boy, am I ever! ,[sees a book on the floor], A book? I love books! ,[goes back to throwing books], A book! ,[throws books], A book!
,SpongeBob:, ,[dodges the incoming books], That's right, Patrick. ,[dodges a book], Play nice with the pretty squares. Gary, this is really one for the books, eh? ,[laughs],
,[Gary meows dully in response. SpongeBob laughs, but gets a book thrown in his mouth. He turns to the screen and laughs as he shows the cover of the book entitled, ""The End.""],

"SpongeBob:, ,[Starts with scene of The Krusty Krab zooming in, then we see SpongeBob ringing the bell], Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur. ,[blows a kiss then a heart pops up and Squidward accidentally swallows it and starts choking],
,Squidward:, It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!
,SpongeBob:, Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef. ,[talking to customer], For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love. ,[reaches into his chest and pulls out a heart and sprinkles some of it on the Krabby Patties. He then pants], Enjoy your meal! ,[sighs], It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[breathes], Oh, yeah, you really touched his life. ,[cuts to scene of customer eating his Krabby Patties like a pig],
,SpongeBob:, Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.
,Squidward:, Quality food?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah!
,Squidward:, Good people?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh. ,[nods],
,Squidward:, Discriminating tastes?
,SpongeBob:, Testify!
,Squidward:, D'oh! ,[breathes angrily, then runs up to customer then takes a Krabby Patty], Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage! ,[Squidward takes away a Krabby Patty, then the customer cries],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect. ,[takes Krabby Patty from Squidward and puts it in customers mouth like a baby bottle], There, there. ,[to Squidward], Mr. Krabs will be ashamed! ,[Mr. Krabs walks in],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, you filthy bilge rats!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way! ,[goes around to the back of the Krusty Krab and starts tipping it and all the customers fall out and then puts it back and walks into the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, What's happening, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!
,Squidward:, Fancy? Froufrou?
,Mr. Krabs:, We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Chef exchange program?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stops laughing], Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes! ,[bus arrives], Heh, looks like it's early. ,[kicks SpongeBob into the bus and it drives off],
,Squidward:, It was that easy? All these years? ,[sniffles], I've underestimated the power of public transportation! ,[another bus arrives with Le Schnook on it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
,Squidward:, Does your middle name happen to be ""No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here""? ,[he and Mr. Krabs laugh],
,Le Schnook:, I find you disgusting. ,[they stop laughing], However, my culture dictates zat I must kiss you regardless. ,[kisses Squidward on each cheek, then spits twice before doing the same with Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy.
,Squidward:, But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction! ,[cuts to scene of the bus dropping off SpongeBob at the Fancy! restaurant. SpongeBob then walks into the kitchen],
,Fancy Head Chef:, What is this rubbish?! I would not wipe my own bottom with this! ,[slaps Archie who is holding a steak], Start over! And this ,[drinks boiled water, then spits it on Paco], I would not wash my own bottom with this after carefully wiping and wiping and wiping! ,[slaps Paco], Now go stand in the corner and think about what you have done! ,[Paco walks away sadly], And where is my exchange chef?! 
,SpongeBob:, Um, right here, sir.
,Fancy Head Chef:, ,[laughs], There you are. Bonjour! ,[kisses SpongeBob two times, SpongeBob giggles and the chief slaps him], Now, get to your station and prepare me your best dish! ,[SpongeBob runs to a pot, puts some ingredients into it, then takes out a Krabby Patty and blows a kiss and a heart shows up. The chef then grabs it and crushes it], This is not funny! And I certainly did not exchange my top sous chef for a, how you say, comedian! ,[puts Krabby Patty in SpongeBob's mouth and then pulls is nose causing him to eat it], Prepare me a gourmet dish, NOW! ,[SpongeBob runs over to a counter with vegetables on it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts chopping vegetables], I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than... ,[chops vegetables into a Krabby Patty then laughs nervously], Just warming up. ,[Chief gets angry, he then screams than gets a tray of stuff and puts in in the oven], Come on, SpongeBob! ,[whistles and then takes out a Krabby Patty and throws it on the ground, Chief gets angry again, he then cracks an egg into a pan], Just one egg then... ,[egg turns into a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob gets mad and throws it on the ground along with many other Krabby Patties], No, that's not it, no...
,Fancy Head Chef:, You are making a mockery of my... ,[Krabby Patty accidentally lands in his mouth and he eats it], This taste is fantastic! What do you call it? ,[he then eats another one],
,SpongeBob:, A Krabby Patty.
,Fancy Head Chef:, ,[is eating more Krabby Patties], The whole world must taste this!
,Narrator:, Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab... ,[We see that the Krusty Krab is all decorated fancy],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, Squidward, look at this! ,[holds up a plate with a small fruit on it], We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy. ,[laughs and then Squidward smells its horrible odor],
,Squidward:, Oh! What ,is, that?!
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something.
,Le Schnook:, Wrong, monsieur! It is ze Rare Fruit of ze Kazook Tree.
,Mr. Krabs:, So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks?
,Le Schnook:, Its naturally rancid odor can only be neutralized by shredded gold.
,Mr. Krabs:, Shredded... ,[gulps], gold? ,[Le Schnook then starts shredding gold with a cheese grater. Mr. Krabs screams and takes it away from him], Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?
,Le Schnook:, Price can be no object when it comes to dealing with exquisite food like zis. It must be prepared with only the finest ingredients, and eaten with only the finest silverware, while sitting on the finest furniture! ,[Le Schnook tries to sit in one of the chair, but it is just a billboard], Zis... is not ze chair I ordered...
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, well you see those were out of stock.
,Le Schnook:, And zis fork of plastic... Spray painted to look silver, is it not? ,[Mr. Krabs starts to sweat, chuckling nervously. Le Schnook gets back up, dusting himself], I cannot prepare food UNDER ZESE CONDITIONS! ,[cuts back to the Fancy! restaurant where there is a big line and everybody is eating Krabby Patties],
,Fancy Head Chief:, Monsieur SpongeBob, although it is in direct violation of our chef exchange program rules, let me assure you that these kisses are not merely a formality. They are genuine! ,[kisses SpongeBob twice], I am sure that this is only the beginning of a long and... ,[SpongeBob's alarm on his wrist watch rings],
,SpongeBob:, Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again! ,[is about to walk out, but the chief stops him],
,Fancy Head Chef:, I apologize, Monsieur SpongeBob, but you can see that my customers had grown rather fond of your Krabby Patties.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab! ,[starts taking all the Krabby Patties and putting them in a sack and then puts it in his suitcase], So long! ,[customers gasp and SpongeBob begins to leave and one customer holds on to his leg],
,Customer:, Wait, just one more?
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. ,[all customers hold on to his leg. However, he manages to get out. The scene switches to the Krusty Krab and it has a sign that reads “out of business” because it went bankrupt. Inside the restaurant, repo men are seen hauling away the fancy furniture. We then see Mr. Krabs crying in his office],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm ruined! Busted! ,[phone then rings and Mr. Krabs answers it], Hello?
,Pearl:, ,[on phone], Daddy, the house is full of burglars. ,[Mr. Krabs laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men. ,[Mr. Krabs hangs up and notices Squidward being held on to by his arms by two other repo men],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents.
,Squidward:, You sold me?!?
,Mr. Krabs:, No! ,Bartered, is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps.
,Repo Man:, Come on, mac! ,[takes him away],
,Squidward:, You're pathetic! ,[Le Schnook then walks in],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now.
,Le Schnook:, Not quite. My time in the chef's exchange program has expired. So my ""eats"" and I are leaving. ,[hands Mr. Krabs a bill], This is for you.
,Mr. Krabs:, Is it money?
,Le Schnook:, It is the bill for my services. ,[Mr. Krabs unfolds the bill. His eyes become bloodshot, and he is unable to move],
,Repo Man:, One side, please. ,[Repo men take Mr. Krabs’ desk and chair away while he is sitting in it, a repo man brings Mr. Krabs back into the restaurant lobby. He is set down on the floor. Mr. Krabs starts crying],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice.
,SpongeBob:, ,[High pitched], Mr. Kra-a-abs?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, now I'm scared.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Darn his cursed mocking voice! I... ,[notices SpongeBob], SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!
,[The scene cuts to all customers talking at once. We can hear some of them. Customer #1 says: ""Oh, please, we must have some Krabby Patties. We just adore..."". Customer #2 says: ""Please, Krabby Patties..."". Customer #3 says: ""Krabby Patties, please."". Customer #4 says: ""Krabby Patties...""],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[now talking to Squidward], Well, Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientèle back, and rich disgusting new clientèle to boot! ,[Rich woman burps], I'm back in business!
,Squidward:, Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey, get back you, eat your own. ,[Mr. Krabs throws them a bucket of Krabby Patties, the customers squeal like pigs], Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Mr. Krabs. ,[Blows another kiss, Squidward swallows it and starts choking. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh],

,Larry:, Looking out at this sea of plastic muscles and sagging flesh. Frankly, I'm disgusted.

,Larry:, ,[grunts], Here!

,SpongeBob:, Aah! Thanks, Larry!

,Larry:, Uh, what are you doing?
,Mr. Krabs:, You said everything was free.
,Larry:, ,[laughs], No, no. Your first visit is free.
,Mr. Krabs:, So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!
,[Mr. Krabs walks back inside with the exercise bicycle.],
,Larry:, ,[laughs], Time to go live the dream! Right after I... file this paperwork.
,[Close-up of paperwork.],
,Larry:, ,[while reading some of the paperwork], I didn't think there'd be so much of it.
,[Larry drops his head down on the desk in disgust.],
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?
,[SpongeBob's legs are all cramped up. Larry freaks out.],
,Larry:, Even your cramps have cramps! You need to follow my number 1 rule. ,[pulls out water bottle], Always be hydrating.

,SpongeBob:, Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?

,Frank (muscular goldfish):, It's Larry, King of the Gym!

,Larry:, Oh, you guys. I'm just an ordinary Alpha Lobster doing his job. Towel boy!

,Larry:, Polish this crown for me. Will you?

,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these... ,[tries to lift weights with a barbell], really heavy... pieces of metal for free!

,Mr. Krabs:, Ow! Free!
,[Mr. Krabs' shell breaks into pieces, revealing his pink skin and leaving Mr. Krabs dazed.],
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things.
,French Narrator:, Flashback...
,[The flashback shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of snail food while feeding Gary, which ends up pulling his arms off. Then it shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of groceries that was given from an old lady, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. Then it showed SpongeBob trying to lift his pillow while going to bed, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. And finally, it showed SpongeBob, after warming himself up, trying to lift the pile of arms he lost, which also resulted in pulling his arms off.],
,French Narrator:, End of flashback...
,Larry:, Let me see. I may have something that'll work for you.
,[Larry looks through his cabinet and picks up a box of cotton swabs.],
,Larry:, Here we go. Cotton swabs. ,[takes a cotton swab stick], Cotton balls. ,[sticks two cotton balls on each end], Here. Try this on for size, Hercules.
,[Larry gives SpongeBob the cotton swab with the cotton balls on it. SpongeBob tries to lift it but ends up pulling his arms off.],
,SpongeBob:, How am I doing?
,Larry:, Pathetic.
,SpongeBob:, ,[talks with a jug of water in mouth], Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!
,[SpongeBob drinks the water from the jug.],
,Larry:, Yeah, I've got another idea, SpongeBob. Come with me.
,[SpongeBob regrows his arms and follows Larry as he drinks the water. Larry and SpongeBob enter another exercise room.],
,Larry:, First thing tomorrow morning, this is gonna be where I leave my exercise class.
,SpongeBob:, I'll be there!
,Larry:, That's the spirit! And we're going to get you started early. Let me see some crunches!
,[SpongeBob is seen munching on some kelpo cereal. Larry pulls the cereal box away.],
,Larry:, The only thing I wanna see in your mouth is that water bottle! ,[stuffs a water bottle in SpongeBob's mouth], Now what did I tell you? Always be hydrated! Now, I'll show you some crunches! ,[does sit-ups], Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh. ,[laughs when bending over], Only now, I'll do it on my back.
,[SpongeBob flips and lands on his back. Then he does sit-ups while laughing.],
,Larry:, Could you do it without the laugh?
,SpongeBob:, I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not. ,[laughs],
,Larry:, Whatever works I guess. Keep up with that and most importantly...
,SpongeBob:, Always be hydrating.
,[SpongeBob sticks a jug of water on his head and does sit-ups while laughing.],
,Larry:, ,[sighs], Ok. I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on.
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs rubbing a towel on himself at the front desk while Larry is working on the paperwork.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!
,Larry:, Do you have to do that in front of me?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes! Yes I do! ,[throws the towel in Larry's face], Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!
,[Mr. Krabs laughs as he walks away. Larry gets off his desk and attempts to pick up the towels Mr. Krabs threw. But as he bends over, he back cracks and his belly pops out, freaking out a passing customer.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice potbelly!
,Larry:, Potbelly? ,[pokes his belly],
,[Larry hears SpongeBob laughing.],
,Larry:, Oh, I forgot all about my prodigy.
,[Larry enters the gym and a shadow creeps down on him.],
,Larry:, ,[gasps], Oh my Neptune!
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab where the hungry customers are complaining about not getting their food. In the kitchen, SpongeBob attempts to do his job as a fry cook. But due to his newly massive strength and buffed up body, everything he touches ends up getting crushed and stepped on.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!
,[SpongeBob goes to lift the patties, but ends up lifting the stove. The stove flies out of the restaurant and lands on Frankie Billy who is driving his boat.],
,Frankie Billy:, My legs! ,[boat explodes], I'm ok! ,[the stove lands on him], Slightly less ok!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob walks through the wall.],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah?
,Squidward:, What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I hope you have some glue for my because I am ripped!
,[SpongeBob's muscle punches Squidward's face. The muscles on his belly become six sponges popping up and down. The muscle on his right leg turns into a solid gold block. SpongeBob's nose reflexes.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!
,[SpongeBob runs off to Larry's gym as Squidward's face pops back out. The scene changes to people coming in and out of the gym. Larry, who is now extremely obese, is still at his desk working on his paperwork.],
,SpongeBob:, Larry?
,[Larry stands up and all of the papers fly around.],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go.
,Larry:, With all this paperwork, I haven't had any time to do my crunches. The only thing I've been crunching is numbers. But I'm gonna get back in shape. You'll see.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!
,Larry:, SpongeBob, tell me the truth. ,[shows SpongeBob his belly], Do I have a potbelly?
,[SpongeBob freaks out a bit.],
,SpongeBob:, No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly.
,[SpongeBob is almost about to laugh but keeps his cool.],
,Larry:, ,[sighs], See you in exercise class. I guess.
,[SpongeBob goes to the exercise room and Larry begins to cry in agony. As he cries, his tears fall into the opening of his round belly. Mr. Krabs shows up with a spoon.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh boy! Free soup! ,[tastes a sample of Larry's tears], Little heavy on the salt.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and everyone in the exercise room getting ready for class.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today.
,[The crowd murmurs in amazement.],
,SpongeBob:, I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back. ,[does sit-ups as he laughs],
,[The crowd does the same thing.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[lays on his back and moves his legs in the air], Walk on your back.
,[The crowd also does the same thing.],
,SpongeBob:, And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.
,[SpongeBob pours water on his head with a water bottle and the crowd did the same thing.],
,SpongeBob:, I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs.
,[SpongeBob lays on his back and pretends to ride a bicycle. The crowd does the same thing. Through the window of the exercise room, a depressed Larry is watching from the outside. He thinks that SpongeBob is a well better instructor than he is and sadly walks by the steam room. Mr. Krabs pops out of the steam room.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker.
,[Mr. Krabs pops back in the steam room. Larry sighs in depression and heads back to his desk. He drinks some coffee. He takes a pencil and attempts to break it. But due to is decreased muscle strength, he couldn't break it. He then tries to lift weights with another pencil but with donuts on each end. However, he couldn't do it because of his loss in muscle strength.],
,Larry:, Oh, what's the use.
,[Larry eats a donut and drops his face flat on his desk.],
,Larry:, Oh, who am I kidding!
,[SpongeBob arrives on an exercise bike.],
,SpongeBob:, You wanted to see me, sir?
,Larry:, Yeah. ,[eats other donut], Look, uh, you're obviously the alpha male at the gym now and I'm just a shell of my former self.
,SpongeBob:, I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty...
,Larry:, I need you to take over. You're a natural leader, SpongeBob. ,[puts the crown on SpongeBob's head], You should be in charge of the fun stuff while I sit here in the reception area slowly getting fatter and paler until I die.
,SpongeBob:, This sounds great.
,[Larry begins to cry.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!
,Larry:, Come over here and give me a bro-hug!
,[The crown falls off of SpongeBob's head.],
,SpongeBob:, You mean a br-ug?
,Larry:, I don't wanna call it that.
,SpongeBob:, Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!
,[SpongeBob and Larry hug each other and cried in despair. But they hug and cry, water spews out of SpongeBob and he shrinks back to his normal size.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, what happened?
,Larry:, Dude, you were just overhydrated! Those weren't real muscles, they were water muscles!
,SpongeBob:, Larry, your br-ug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!
,Larry:, Don't say br-ug.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Br-ug. ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob slides off of Larry's claws and SpongeBob does his sit-ups while laughing. Larry does the same exact thing and in the process, his muscles begin to build up and his strength returns to normal.],
,Larry:, SpongeBob, laughing on my back was just what I needed! ,[buffs up], You're a pretty good instructor after all. ,[sits down], Oh boy. The way you laugh really gets on my nerves.
,[SpongeBob continues to laugh as he does his sit-ups.],
,French Narrator:, The very next evening...
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab late at night. SpongeBob is happily flipping the patties on the grill.],
,Squidward:, Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob places his two spatulas in his pockets.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what a great day.
,Squidward:, And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.
,[The scene changes to Larry's gym getting ready to close up for the night. Larry is walking by the steam room until he sees steam coming out.],
,Larry:, Huh? ,[sniffs], What is that smell? ,[jiggles the doorknob], Mr. Krabs, how long have you been in there?!
,[Larry pulls the door off and sees Mr. Krabs as a cooked up crab on a plate with melted butter and lemons on the side, meaning that he had been in the steam room too long.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. There is a long line of customers who are growing tired and impatient from Bubble Bass's order.],
,Customers:, Just go! Oh, no.
,Bubble Bass:, Yes, I will have a quad patty, with a sprinkling of Himalayan salt, smoked paprika, and micro greens.
,Squidward:, Gimme a quad—
,Bubble Bass:, Hold on. I'm not finished with my order.
,Customers:, Aw, come on! ,[some of them turn and leave],
,Bubble Bass:, I would like my patties be-cheesed, but not just any cheese will do. Have you any aged gouda? ,[the customers grumble], And yes, it is pronounced ""how-uda,"" not ""goo-da.""
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[growls and taps Bubble Bass's shoulder], Just eat the regular Krabby Patty ,[shoves a Krabby Patty in Bubble Bass's mouth], and stop wasting everybody's time!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! You know we don't treat our customers like that. ,[Mr. Krabs is stunned], It says right here, in the Krusty Krab manual. ,[clears throat and reads], ""The customer is always right, when they have money.""
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! Such wise and beautiful words. Thanks for reminding me, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, I'm here to serve, Mr. Krabs. ,[accidentally splatters a dropping of ketchup on the floor],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[growls and screams], Ketchup waster! ,[SpongeBob whimpers], Oh! Sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't mean it. No more outbursts. I'll be nice Mr. Krabs, I promise.
,Squidward:, Your napkin. ,[gives Bubble Bass a napkin, but drops it],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[growls], Waster!
,[Mr. Krabs jumps into the cashier boat, but Squidward climbs out and runs away. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward a chase around the restaurant as he rows the cashier boat. Squidward steps on SpongeBob as he runs.],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm? ,[gets run over by Mr. Krabs and the cashier boat], Ow! Mr. Krabs! ,[SpongeBob grabs the cashier boat and his lower half follows], You gotta calm down!
,[Mr. Krabs continues to chase Squidward all over the restaurant while dragging SpongeBob. During the chase, SpongeBob's arm entangles everything and every one of the customers inside. Moments later, Larry the Lobster enters the restaurant. Squidward hides behind Larry. Mr. Krabs crash into Larry.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! ,[SpongeBob shouts as he crashes into Larry as well. Mr. Krabs, with SpongeBob on his back, and Squidward climb around Larry], I'll murder-lize him!
,Larry:, Relax, little crab guy.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[growls], Get your muscled mitts off me! Get off! Get...,[sighs happily],
,Larry:, That's right. Give in to the healing power of my pecs.
,SpongeBob:, I feel so secure.
,Larry:, ,[sighs], All better?
,Squidward:, What? You let him go? We're all dead! ,[shouts, crawls into the kitchen and gets burned by the grill], Ow! The grill's still on! ,[runs out of the kitchen and screams as he is burnt from the grill; SpongeBob splashes Squidward with water; Squidward slips and crashes into the table where Larry and Mr. Krabs are sitting in.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know what's wrong with me. The Krusty Krab's just been so busy. I never seem to get a break.
,Larry:, Sounds like someone needs a vacation.
,Mr. Krabs:, I—I could use some me time.
,SpongeBob:, And don't worry. Squidward and I can take care of the Krusty Krab while you're gone.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm...
,[Mr. Krabs imagines the Krusty Krab completely burnt down with SpongeBob standing in the middle.],
,SpongeBob:, Order up! ,[the patty disintegrates],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams], I'm sorry, but I can't leave you guys in charge. I need a strong man to run this place—someone who's a rock and can really handle the load, you know? But who has that kind of strength, hmm?
,[While Mr. Krabs is talking, Larry lifts him up and down with his claw.],
,SpongeBob:, Psst, psst! ,[points to Larry as he stammers excitedly],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's it! Larry, how would you like to manage the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation?
,Larry:, Larry's got his own gym to run.
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Larry. It'll be fun.
,Larry:, Larry loves fun! I'm in.
,Mr. Krabs:, All right! Ah! ,[gives Larry a high-five, but his claw hits Squidward; he groans],
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob continuing his work at the grill. Larry enters the kitchen.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Larry. How you liking your new job?
,Larry:, Larry likes it just fine. But do the customers always eat like this?
,[The customers obnoxiously eat their meals.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no. They normally eat like this! ,[grabs the patties from the grill and chews heavily on them],
,Larry:, Those poor people. Someone needs to whip them into shape.
,[SpongeBob continues to chew heavily on the patties. He smiles as meat seeps through his teeth. The scene changes to Squidward taking a customer's order.],
,Squidward:, What'll you have?
,Fred:, Uh...I'll have a double Krabby Patty, Krabby fries, and uh—whoa! ,[gets grabbed by Larry and is put on a treadmill],
,Squidward:, What else?
,Fred:, Uh, uh—a Krabby soda...Uh, uh—a Krabby...,[slips and falls off the treadmill], My leg!
,Squidward:, ,[laughs and gets strapped by a stretching band with a motor], Hey! ,[voice warbling], Can I help you?
,Frank:, ,[runs on treadmill], Yeah, I'll take a Krabby salad, dressing on the side, and 60 more minutes on this rad treadmill. ,[hands Squidward a dollar],
,Squidward:, ,[warbling], Here's your change.
,[The scene changes to Larry putting a patty on a weight.],
,Larry:, Here's your order, sir. ,[gives it to Octavius Rex], And don't forget your side salad! ,[gives it to Octavius Rex, but the weights are too heavy for him to carry],
,Frank:, Yeah! Push it, push it!
,Larry:, Push it, push it!
,Octavius Rex:, ,[grunts], Okay, okay. I'll push it. ,[pushes the weights to the table],
,Larry:, Push it, push it!
,Frank:, Yeah, push it!
,[Octavius Rex pushes the weight onto the table.],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, you made it! Now, claim your Krabby Patty!
,Octavius Rex:, ,[weakly], Hooray...,[drops his face on the salad],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, too pooped for a Krabby Patty.
,Larry:, Ah, forget Krabby Patties. Those things are over. ,[throws away the patty],
,SpongeBob:, But Larry, Krabby Patties are why people come here.
,Larry:, Ooh, not anymore. Now we only serve salads and protein power shakes!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, power shake! I wanna taste. ,[takes a sip of the power shake, but spits it out onto the radio as it tasted terrible],
,Larry:, You like?
,SpongeBob:, No, Larry. No.
,Larry:, But it gets you jacked!
,SpongeBob:, I don't wanna be jacked. I just want my Krabby Patties back.
,Larry:, Everybody wants to get jacked.
,Frank:, Yeah, jacked!
,[Larry and Frank buff themselves up and show off their muscles.],
,SpongeBob:, Look, Larry, I really think we should go back to serving Krabby Patties. People love the...
,[Larry exhales and relaxes.],
,SpongeBob:, Larry?
,Larry:, ,[stammers], Jacked.
,[The scene changes to Larry make some serious changes to the Krusty Krab. He turns the entire dining room into an obstacle course for the customers to run through. SpongeBob and Squidward are serving power shakes while customers run through the course.],
,Larry:, SpongeBob! Squidward! Let's move it, boys. Get those power shakes out and those heart rates up!
,[SpongeBob and Squidward run to serve the power shakes to the customers. SpongeBob climbs the rope and serves the shake to Nat Peterson on the rock-climbing wall. But one of the shakes drops onto Nat Peterson and sends him falling off.],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry!
,[Squidward jumps over some hurdles, but almost gets stepped on by Martin. He laughs in relief, but gets himself squashed by Bubble Bass.],
,Squidward:, Whoa!
,Bubble Bass:, ,[tastes the power shake], Oh! Horrible sustenance.
,[SpongeBob cowers behind some weights as everyone in the Krusty Krab is being tortured and pummeled by the strong guys. It soon dawns on SpongeBob that Larry is literally turning the Krusty Krab into a gym. Squidward hides behind the weights with SpongeBob.],
,Squidward:, Let's get outta here!
,[Squidward and SpongeBob run over to a rope net.],
,SpongeBob:, Pardon my reach.
,[Squidward climbs over the rope net, but gets himself tangled in it. SpongeBob struggles to pull Squidward off.],
,Squidward:, Go on without me! ,[SpongeBob runs, but is grabbed by Squidward], No, wait, don't.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym.
,Larry:, ,[to Fred as he is doing weight-lifting with a salt shaker], Feel...the...burn!
,[Fred lifts the barbell high. SpongeBob sprays some deodorant spray on Fred's armpit. The barbell drops on Fred's head and salt spills on his salad plate.],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, go tell Larry he's fired.
,Squidward:, Are you crazy? He is way too big for that. We need to come at this another way—a smart, dignified way! I know—we'll sabotage the place. ,[a strong guy passes by, drinking a power shake], And I know just where to start: the power shakes.
,SpongeBob:, I'm on it! ,[giggles and runs off to the kitchen],
,Squidward:, Wait, wait—what about me?
,SpongeBob:, ,[adds butter to the blender], Butter! ,[adds lard to the blender], Lard! ,[adds mayonnaise to the blender], Mayonnaise. ,[grunts happily as he closes the blender lid],
,[SpongeBob turns on the blender and all the ingredients blend together. Once it's done, SpongeBob scoops up some of the mixed up ingredients with a cup and dips it into the fryer.],
,SpongeBob:, And now, fry it all up into a greasy, heart-stopping surprise! ,[goes to serve the shake to Larry], Here you go.
,[But instead of drinking it, Larry spreads the shake all over his pecs and rubs it like suntan lotion.],
,Larry:, I'm loving this oily concoction. It really makes Larry's muscles pop! ,[buffs up, grabs SpongeBob and rubs him over his pecs], Thanks, SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob groans while being rubbed against Larry's pecs. SpongeBob slides off Larry and slides over to Squidward.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, that failed. What now?
,Squidward:, We'll sabotage the weight machines. Then these muscle heads will have to find a new place to work out!
,SpongeBob:, Gotcha! ,[runs off],
,Squidward:, Wait, you idiot! Get me out of here.
,[SpongeBob loosens up some nuts and bolts to make one of the weight-lifting machines fragile. Once he was done, Frank comes over to do some work out. He gets himself tangled in the weight machine, but the machine made him become stronger, even though SpongeBob sabotaged it. Frank breaks free and shows off his muscles.],
,Frank:, Awesome workout, bro!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess this place belongs to the gym guys now. ,[takes off his hat and leaves],
,Squidward:, Don't leave me, SpongeBob! Wait, what am I saying?
,[Outside, customers are crawling everywhere, dying of hunger.],
,Customers:, Help us! ,[groans and moans], Hungry!
,[Sandals gnaws on his arm and Bubble Bass eats some sand.],
,SpongeBob:, What are you all doing out here? You should just go home.
,Harold:, We can't go home. There's no Krabby Patties at home. I need my Krabby Patties, man! ,[wailing], You gotta help me!
,Customers:, Help us! Help! Help!
,SpongeBob:, Krabby Patties—that's it! Those gym guys have forgotten the simple, greasy pleasure of munching on a Krabby Patty, and we need to remind them.
,[The scene changes back inside. Larry and some other strong guys are doing some workouts, when suddenly, they hear something in the kitchen.],
,Larry and the gym guys:, Huh?
,[The door opens. SpongeBob, Bubble Bass and the angry customers confront Larry and his gym guys.],
,Larry:, SpongeBob, you're ruining Larry's pump sesh!
,SpongeBob:, Larry, you're ruining the Krusty Krab!
,Larry:, Get 'em, men!
,[Larry's gym guys charge at the customers.],
,SpongeBob:, Fire!
,[The customers fire Krabby Patties with their slingshots. The patties fly into the mouths of the gym guys and they start eating them.],
,Gym Guys:, Mmm!
,Frank:, ,[growls as he corners Bubble Bass], Get over here! ,[Bubble Bass turns around and SpongeBob shots a patty in Frank's mouth], Mmm. Oh, gimme, gimme! ,[eats a platter of patties from Gus],
,Squidward:, Give him a single! Give him a double with cheese! ,[gets splattered in the face by a patty],
,[Nat Peterson does his ninja-like moves while using ketchup and mustard bottles as nunchackus. Nat Peterson jumps in the air and SpongeBob swings on a rope, serving Krabby Patties to the gym guys.],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah!
,[Nat Peterson sprays ketchup and mustard on the patties.],
,Gym Guys:, Huh? ,[munches on the patties],
,SpongeBob:, Give into the flavor, Larry!
,Larry:, ,[fights off with his barbells], Never!
,SpongeBob:, He's too fast. We need a distraction. ,[pulls out a barbell from his head], Here, use this. ,[gives it to Bubble Bass and he does some weight-lifting],
,Larry:, No, you gotta keep your elbow—,[SpongeBob shoots a Krabby Patty into Larry's mouth and he chews on it; SpongeBob blows on his slingshot and Larry eventually gives in as he swallows the patty], Oh! Greasy, fatty, sticky, and gummy! It's delicious! Larry's been a fool. I've spent all my time working on my muscles when I could've been working on these delicious sandwiches. ,[sobbing], What's—what's wrong with me? ,[his pecs cry],
,Bubble Bass:, Now those are some sad pecs.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up to Larry], Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape. ,[hands Larry a tissue and his pecs blow into it; three of Larry's gym guys eat Krabby Patties, but gain weight], Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers.
,[The scene changes to Larry and the gym guys carrying their workout equipment out of the Krusty Krab. Squidward, on the other hand, is still tangled up in the rope net.],
,Squidward:, Somebody let me out of this thing already!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[singing as he comes back from his vacation], Home sweet home. ,[enters the restaurant], Hmm?
,[All of the customers including Patrick are gobbling down the Krabby Patties and things are now back to normal at the Krusty Krab.],
,SpongeBob:, Order up! ,[slingshots a patty to Fred],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs happily], Everything's just how I left it.

"[the episode opens up on the island of Bikini Atoll, where a rope accidentally rips, decelerating the supply of fortune cookies down to Bikini Bottom],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, look at that cloud, Gary! It looks just like a giraffe eating ice cream.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary! It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and—
,[SpongeBob gets crushed by the giant box of fortune cookies and rises from the sand],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Gary, that was a pretty heavy cloud.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Gary, it's not a cloud at all.
,[SpongeBob pushes himself out of the sand],
,SpongeBob:, Let's see what's inside.
,[SpongeBob then removes a piece of the box and releases all of the fortune cookies],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!
,[SpongeBob and Gary begin eating the fortune cookies. SpongeBob opens his fortune and starts reading it],
,SpongeBob:, ""A great fortune has fallen upon you."" ,[gasps], Did you hear that Gary, the fortune is true! Let's look at your future. ,[Gary hands SpongeBob his fortune], ""Happy trails will follow you always."" ,[gasps and points], Your fortune came true too!
,[Gary then looks behind him to gaze at his trail],
,SpongeBob:, Cookies with fortunes that actually come true? We have to share these with everybody!
,[the scene transitions to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is declining SpongeBob's idea],
,Mr. Krabs:, No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel.
,SpongeBob:, Aw, why not, Mr. Krabs?
,Squidward:, ,[chuckles], Because, SpongeBob, fortune cookie fortunes are always lame and they never come true
,SpongeBob:, Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one. ,[Hands him the fortune cookie],
,Squidward:, ,[backs it away], No. ,[SpongeBob pushes it back to him], Way.
,[SpongeBob forces Squidward to eat the cookie by controlling his arms and shoving the cookie in his mouth. Squidward then spits out the fortune and begins reading it],

,SpongeBob:, So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, They weren't overcooked at all!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, look! ,[picks him up and turns him around where we are shown a tall building],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?
,Mr. Krabs:, Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!
,SpongeBob:, Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"". Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger! ,[takes out a whole burger from inside his body], If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born.
,Squidward:, Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish. ,[jellyfish stings Squidward on the head, forming a bump], See?
,SpongeBob:, ,[pushes the bump in and it goes to the other side of Squidward's head], Ooh!
,Mr. Krabs:, Come inside. ,[now inside Krusty Towers], Isn't it beautiful?

,Mr. Krabs:, My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in. ,[walks behind desk], Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"".
,Dave:, Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.
,Mr. Krabs:, If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.
,Dave:, ,[looks at watch], Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch. ,[sighs and leaves],

,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, Squidward, ,you, man the front desk.
,Patrick:, I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.
,Squidward:, This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.
,Patrick:, Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?
,Squidward:, Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?
,Patrick:, Sometimes I just need to get away from it all. ,[rings bell], Wow, this hotel has everything!
,Squidward:, ,[takes bell], Gimme that! Now sign the register.
,Patrick:, I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study! ,[cries],
,Squidward:, Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.
,Patrick:, Oh, okay. ,[takes pen], Do you mind?! ,[Squidward turns around so Patrick starts writing. Squidward peeks], Don't look! ,[Squidward turns around], Done! ,[Patrick has drawn a giant monster doodle of himself fighting three attack planes.],
,Squidward:, Close enough. Here's your room key.
,Patrick:, I'll need some help with my bags.
,Squidward:, How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!
,Patrick:, This is a hotel?
,Squidward:, ,[groans], SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Take Patrick and his bags to his room.
,Patrick:, What about my Krabby Patty?
,Squidward:, And bring him a Krabby Patty.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, ,you, can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty. ,[he exits],
,Squidward:, Oh, Mr Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor? ,[mocking Squidward], I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
,Squidward:, Fine. Let's go, Patrick. ,[has struggle with Patrick's bags as he is walking up to the elevator],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[comes out of the elevator], This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator. ,[Squidward walks to the other elevator, which turns out to be stairs. He grumbles because of this. Squidward walks up stairs as Patrick gets off the guest elevator],
,Squidward:, What's in these bags, rocks? ,[bag opens, spilling out rocks], Hey, these ,are, rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?
,Patrick:, I don't tell you how to live ,your, life!
,Squidward:, Well, here's your room.
,Patrick:, Wow.
,Squidward:, Enjoy your stay.
,Patrick:, Squidward, wait! ,[takes out a rock from his pocket and gives it to Squidward as a tip], Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.
,SpongeBob:, Your Krabby Patty, sir. ,[Squidward attempting to throw the rock that Patrick gave to him as a tip], Hey, Squidward, cool rock.
,Patrick:, Hold on a second, SpongeBob. ,[hands SpongeBob a dollar, Squidward makes a surprise face, then scowls], Here you are, my good man.
,SpongeBob:, Why, thank you, Patrick!
,Patrick:, There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend ,[Squidward looks at his rock and becomes frustrated], Squidward!
,Squidward:, What now?!
,Patrick:, I don't like crusts on my sandwich!
,Squidward:, It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?
,Patrick:, Peel it.
,Squidward:, ,[peels the skin off the bun angrily], Happy? ,[Patrick inhales the patty],
,SpongeBob:, Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.
,Patrick:, Could you do one more thing for me?
,Squidward:, Why don't you ask SpongeBob?
,Patrick:, Good idea, Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, How may I serve you, sir?
,Patrick:, I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yes, sir! ,[both of them eat a bunch of Krabby Patties. As Squidward heads down the employee elevator, Mr. Krabs is on the phone],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.
,Squidward:, What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?
,Mr. Krabs:, He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.
,[Squidward is unclogging the toilet when he unclogs SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Squidward! ,[Squidward puts him back in the toilet. Patrick flushes],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!
,Mr. Krabs:, He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!
,Squidward:, But, Mr. Krabs...
,Mr. Krabs:, Deny no guests! ,[phone rings], Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.
,Squidward:, A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!
,Patrick:, Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.
,Squidward:, That's it! I've had enough!
,Patrick:, Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Squidward comes out of the guest elevator], Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!
,Squidward:, Not anymore. I quit. ,[Squidward throws his uniform on Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Quit? You can't quit. ,[Squidward walks out naked and reenters with Hawaiian-styled clothes. Squidward rings the bell], Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!
,Squidward:, One room, please. On the top floor.
,Mr. Krabs:, What do you think you're doing?
,Squidward:, I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where ""we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"".
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't have to rent you a room!
,Squidward:, I've got cash.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh... here's your room key.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, carry my things to my room.
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, guest sir. ,[turns legs into rockets and blasts off through the ceiling],
,Squidward:, ,[talking to Mr. Krabs], And you can carry me to my room.
,Mr. Krabs:, And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.
,Squidward:, The plaque. ,[plaque is shown. Mr. Krabs has just finished carrying Squidward from the employee elevator], Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.
,SpongeBob:, Your room, sir.
,Squidward:, And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], You've got to be kidding me!
,Squidward:, And I want it here in five seconds.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir! ,[runs off and comes back with a Krabby Patty in less than two seconds], Here you are, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.
,Squidward:, Oh, ,I'm, not gonna eat this. You are.
,Mr. Krabs:, What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!
,SpongeBob:, Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward. ,[eats Krabby Patty, then spits it out, showing his tongue covered with toenails and nose hair. Squidward laughs], SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.
,Patrick:, ,[everything in Patrick's room is covered in cheese because apparently he asked for his room with cheese earlier], Hooray!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[phone rings], What is it, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[at Squidward's room], Here's your homemade cookies.
,Squidward:, ,[tries one and spits it out], These don't taste like anything mom used to make!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, how ,did, your mother make 'em?
,Squidward:, How should I know?! Ask my mother! ,[slams the door],
,Mrs. Tentacles:, ,[doorbell rings], Hello? ,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are in ski masks],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[trying to get a big sack in the trunk, but the door won't close], SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob hits the sack with a shovel, but the trunk still won't close],
,SpongeBob:, No good, Mr. Krabs.
,Mrs. Tentacles:, Allow me, boy. ,[closes the trunk door],
,Mr. Krabs:, Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk...
,SpongeBob:, There's room for you to sit up front!
,Mrs. Tentacles:, Let's go bake some cookies, boys.
,SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs:, Hooray!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in Squidward's room where Squidward is sampling the cookies], Well?
,Squidward:, I'm impressed! These ,are, just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.
,Mr. Krabs:, So you're all taken care of?
,Squidward:, Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.
,Mr. Krabs:, What?
,Squidward:, ""We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request"". ,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob change the room to a blue theme, a modern theme, a country theme, a torture theme, and then back to the original], Perfect!
,Mr. Krabs:, This room is exactly the same as when we started!
,Squidward:, Nothing like getting back to the basics.
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!
,Squidward:, Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming.
,Mr. Krabs:, The pool's out back!
,Squidward:, Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim. ,[big swimming pool is now inside the room], Come on in, the water's fine. ,[SpongeBob jumps in],
,Mr. Krabs:, Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?
,Squidward:, Nope, that's it.
,Mr. Krabs:, You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!
,Squidward:, No, I'm good.
,SpongeBob:, Me, too.
,Patrick:, Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place ,is, fancy! ,[gets on diving board], Cannonball! ,[jumps in, but the pool collapses the hotel back into the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[at hospital with the gang], Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.
,Patrick:, That was a hotel?
,Nurse:, Your bill, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, $15,000?!
,Squidward:, You're not gonna have a heart attack, are you?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!
,Patrick:, This is a hospital?
,Mr. Krabs:, Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Hooray!
,Squidward:, ,[plaintively], Oh, boy.

,Mrs. Puff:, Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[While his pupils turn back into hearts], Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I think she...
,Mr. Krabs:, The sun is beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head.
,SpongeBob:, As your financial advisor, I suggest...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[his eyes are back to normal], There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
,[SpongeBob starts to leave, but comes back.],
,SpongeBob:, But...
,Mr. Krabs:, Today! ,[SpongeBob runs off and Mrs. Puff puts her fins over her mouth.], Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll ,[He takes out a barrel.], shade ya! ,[He places the barrel on Mrs. Puff's head.],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, hurry!
,SpongeBob:, ,[as he comes back from the store with a large straw hat], One shady hat.
,Mr. Krabs:, Good job, lad. 
,[Mr. Krabs puts the hat on Mrs. Puff.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, well, thank you, but you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.
,Mr. Krabs:, Didn't need to buy one? ,[He turns his head around like an owl to face SpongeBob, still grinning], You hear that, boy? ,[in high pitch], We didn't need to buy a hat. ,[angrily], Aren't you supposed to be saving me money?!
,SpongeBob:, I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!
,Narrator:, A few moments later...

,[his voice echoes, and SpongeBob is seen sitting on the ground, his arms stretched, and he is panting],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs up, his eyes are shaped like hearts], SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...
,SpongeBob:, Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say, ,[stretches out his eyeballs, imitating Mr. Krabs], ""Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!"" And then I'll say, ""But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!"" Then you'll say, ""We're not talking about this..."" ,[Makes the triangle], ...""Or this""... ,[Makes the square], ...""we're talking about this!"" ,[He squiggles all over the screen. The screen fades out for a moment. Fades back in to see SpongeBob panting with Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, But, lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this! ,[Cut to Mrs. Puff who has many unneeded, expensive items surrounding her],
,Mrs. Puff:, Are we going to the park soon?
,Mr. Krabs:, Please, lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! ,[Starts to cry],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see? ,[Walks offscreen, and comes back with a washing machine], Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted.
,Mr. Krabs:, Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
,SpongeBob:, See?! You just did it again!
,Mr. Krabs:, Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money. ,[SpongeBob gets a blank expression on his face], Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?
,SpongeBob:, Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think? ,[screams], ,Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet!, ,[During SpongeBob's rage, Mrs. Puff looks up these words in the dictionary that Mr. Krabs bought her, and gasps and blushes. SpongeBob angrily walks past Mrs. Puff while muttering, and Mr. Krabs' mouth is agape],
,Mrs. Puff:, I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say, too, Mr. Krabs. ,[Takes off her fur coat, shoes and hat], I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind. ,[Hands him some money from her purse],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, okay.
,Mrs. Puff:, You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs. ,[Mrs. Puff kisses him and his eyes bend into the shape of a heart],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[as his eyes make a heart], Aawww...

,Kelp Thing:, Huh? Eh?
,Narrator:, It's Mermaid Man! Savior of the deep! ,[in comes Barnacle Boy], And his young fit servant, Barnacle Boy.
,Mermaid Man:, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy...unite! ,[both put rings together, then jump down onto Kelp Thing's car], Kelp Thing, this is a posted, no-parking zone.
,Kelp Thing:, But I must do what I do. ,[jumps up in the air until he notices his car is being towed], Huh? ,[The word ""TOWED"" comes on screen. Kelp Thing jumps down and then walks away],
,Mermaid Man:, Evil can't park here between the hours of 6:00am and 12:00pm! ,[the word ""FIN"" appears on-screen. The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club is watching a video about the heroes. They cheer],

,All:, Unite!
,Club Leader:, And now the second order of business: Drippy Brothers Studios is currently in production of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie!
,All:, Ooh!

,Fake Mermaid Man:, Hello, little heroes.
,Patrick:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!
,Fake Mermaid Man:, Well, of course, we are. We're actors.
,SpongeBob:, Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
,Fake Mermaid Man:, Listen, kid, this is an action movie. Your has-been heroes are too OLD for action.
,SpongeBob:, Mermaid Man is timeless!
,Patrick:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloneys ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this... this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are thrown out of the building], Traitors! Wait ‘til we tell Mermaid Man about this. ,[cut to the retirement home],

,Announcer:, A-29.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks in angrily], Too old for an action movie...huh.
,Barnacle Boy:, What is it this time, kid?
,SpongeBob:, Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?
,Barnacle Boy:, They can't be making a movie about us!
,SpongeBob:, But they are! And they're using... ,[close-up of SpongeBob's mouth], actors.
,[The heroes gasp.],
,SpongeBob:, They have shunned our heroes.
,Patrick:, And they weren't nice to them either.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[sobs], Now our dreams of being big screen heroes will never come true.
,SpongeBob:, Well, that makes it even worse.
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[Puts his hands on Mermaid Man's back], You bet it does, kid.
,Mermaid Man:, And the worst part is I can't remember why I started crying. ,[sobs some more],
,Patrick:, Why don't we just make our own movie?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[stops crying], You will?
,SpongeBob:, Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and... ,[close-up of SpongeBob's mouth], their actors.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[jumps on top of the table], Vindication is ours! Vindi... how did I get up here? ,[cut to Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?
,Patrick:, Popcorn?
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, to start making a movie.
,Patrick:, Oh, oh, oh...
,SpongeBob:, Let's start with...the title.
,Patrick:, Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! ""Adventures in the Underground City"".
,SpongeBob:, Great, Pat, what happens?
,Patrick:, Well, there's a city...
,SpongeBob:, ,[typing on a typewriter], City...

,Patrick:, The end.
,SpongeBob:, End. ,[stops typing], That's great, Pat. ,[checks paper], Hmm, seems kinda short.
,Patrick:, I have an idea. Let's make it longer!
,SpongeBob:, Longer, yes. Okay, let's have Mermaid Man get his face... ,[shrinks his face], ...shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer.
,Patrick:, Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Good one, Pat. ,[both laugh],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks to table], What are ye lads doing?
,SpongeBob:, We're making a movie.
,Mr. Krabs:, Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks through his fingers, which make a square shape staring at Pearl. She giggles and holds a Krabby Patty on a tray in her fin],
,Mr. Krabs:, So, what do ye say, lad?
,SpongeBob:, Sure, Mr Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie.
,Mr. Krabs:, I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty.
,[Pearl looks at the Krabby Patty and starts crying massive tears],
,SpongeBob:, You can be in it, too, Pearl.
,Pearl:, ,[stops crying], I'm gonna be a movie star. ,[cut to outside Shady Shoals],
,SpongeBob:, Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives. ,[Sandy holds up a bomb],
,Sandy:, Howdy.
,SpongeBob:, Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair. ,[Mr. Krabs holds up a Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick will run the camera.
,Patrick:, Hey... ,[knocks over the camera and gets tangled up in roll],
,SpongeBob:, This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department.
,Squidward:, ,[walks away], Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?
,SpongeBob:, Not makeup department, you're the makeup 'artist'.
,Squidward:, ,[looks back], Artist?
,SpongeBob:, Makeup artist.
,Squidward:, In that case, let's make those old crabapples sizzle. ,[looks at the heroes], Hmmm... ,[close-ups of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's old, wrinkly faces], Time for the art-eest to go to work. ,[takes out the flamethrower and gets to work. Banging and screaming are heard. Squidward staples their faces together], Voila!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?
,Squidward:, As they'll ever be.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are tied up and look like sausage links], They're beautiful! They look just like they did 30 years ago. ,[Mermaid Man slurping], Okay, action!
,[explosion],
,Sandy:, I love my new job!
,SpongeBob:, Good job, Sandy!
,Plankton:, Psst... ,[has a mini Man Ray head on], I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray. ,[takes out a flashlight and turns it on],
,SpongeBob:, What are you doing?
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, this role was made for me.
,SpongeBob:, That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something. ,[takes microphone stand], You can be the boom operator!
,Plankton:, I thought Sandy was the boom operator!
,Sandy:, Did somebody say boom?
,[explosion],
,Plankton:, All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, start the movie!
,Assistant:, Take 1.
,Mermaid Man:, We have to get back to those swollen Krabby Patties.
,SpongeBob:, Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's ""stolen Krabby Patties.""
,Assistant:, Take 2.
,Mermaid Man:, We have to get back to those stolen naggie daddies.
,SpongeBob:, Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's ""stolen Krabby Patties!""
,Assistant:, ,[somewhat tired tone], Take 5,003.
,Mermaid Man:, We have to get back to those stolen Krabby Patties! And if we don't stop that diabolical scoundrel- ,[mumbles because Plankton accidentally shoves the microphone in his mouth],
,Plankton:, Give it back!
,Barnacle Boy:, I knew this was a bad idea.
,SpongeBob:, Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job.
,Plankton:, This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing.
,Sandy:, Did somebody say boom?
,[explosion],
,Pearl:, Oh, daddy, you said I was going to be a star!
,Mr. Krabs:, You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg.
,Pearl:, Yeah! ,[runs off and cut to steep mountain],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, action!
,Mermaid Man:, To the boat mobile. ,[both jump on the boat mobile, which is really Pearl on her back with wheels],
,SpongeBob:, Cue the sound effects. ,[Pearl uses her tongue for a boat engine],
,Mermaid Man:, Listen to that engine purr. ,[the assistant is straining as he tries to pull Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Pearl up a steep cliff],
,SpongeBob:, Almost there! ,[the assistant grabs the edge of the cliff, but it breaks off causing them to slide down, over a curved slope and into the air. Patrick aims the camera so that it's directly on Pearl, the assistant, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Then they come crashing down onto the set. Pearl gets off of a flattened SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, Good morning, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage.
,Patrick:, Yeah, I got the footage.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what is that?
,Patrick:, Oh, it's a camera.
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, this. ,[takes off lens cap],
,Patrick:, Oh, that's a lens cap.
,SpongeBob:, Did you just put that on?!
,Patrick:, Yup, I didn't want to lose it, so I put it there right before we started filming.
,[SpongeBob screams and goes insane, scoots his butt on the ground, lifts up piece of ground, and eats worms on bottom side. Everyone gasps.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[wailing], The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie!
,Mermaid Man:, Hey, little hero, this reminds me of the Episode 912. We were surrounded. The Kelp-Thing was to our right and their broccoli was on the side. But if there was one thing I remember, it was how to forget.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this is good. Roll the film.
,Mermaid Man:, The rain in Spain stays mainly on the...space! The final countdown. Stick to the...stick to the...Lou, my darling! Lou! ,[falls on ground], Now get out there and finish this movie, kid. ,[cut to the Krusty Krab at night. Mr, Krabs is crying],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, why are you weeping?
,Mr. Krabs:, I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers?! You promised a full house!
,SpongeBob:, And here comes the filling! ,[fan club comes rushing into the Krusty Krab], The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie.
,Club Leader:, Actually, the real movie was sold out. I'll take 200 tickets, please. ,[hands Mr. Krabs stack of money and he stuffs it into his pocket],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, this is what I call a happy ending.
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[movie starts], Well, our big moment, us up on the big screen. ,[Mermaid Man is sleeping],
,SpongeBob:, ,[on-screen, playing with a toy car near a box-made fort with the word ""LOX"" on it], Fort Lox: home to over five billion Krabby Patties. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick each grab a canister of popcorn while watching the movie. SpongeBob uses his tongue and Patrick sucks all the popcorn out of his canister], What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure? ,[the patty vault is opened and a piece of kelp on strings comes down], It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!
,Mermaid Man:, ,[on-screen], Stop! You can't do that forbidden.
,SpongeBob:, ,[on-screen as Kelp-Thing], Watch me!
,Mermaid Man:, Prepare to feel my wrath, you foul villain. ,[Sandy comes in as Mermaid Man's stunt double and fights Kelp Thing. Then Mermaid Man shows up on screen again], You may have won the Krabby Patties, but the battle rages on. ,[real crabs are fighting], Mermaidmanacle Boy, unite! ,[both put rings together. Then 'FIN' comes on-screen],​
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[cheering], Yay! ,[the other Bikini Bottomites are disappointed],
,Mermaid Man:, Well, kid, you showed the world that even though our steps may have been slowed, we still have a little action left in these heroic old bones. ,[bone breaks],
,Barnacle Boy:, Well, at least some of them. ,[all four of them laugh],

"[The episode starts with an exterior shot of the Krusty Krab, but the two left maritime flags are messed up, suggesting something is wrong. In addition, the antenna on the roof is bent and the windows in front have huge holes broken in them, with glass shards scattered around the entrance. Then, several fish run out of the restaurant, screaming loudly. We cut to inside, where Mr. Krabs is sitting on the floor, cowering in fear as a sea bear swims up to him, growling and drooling into a puddle on the floor. The camera zooms out slightly, revealing a broken table, barrels scattered everywhere, and the edge of the Galley Grub menu, which has fallen onto the floor. Plankton, in a lion tamer's hat and holding a chair and whip, looks on from on top of the sea bear's back.],
,Plankton:, Why couldn't I see it before? ,[the sea bear roars very loudly, blowing Mr. Krabs' face back. Plankton chuckles], The way to get the Krabby Patty formula was so obvious! ,[he throws the chair and whip away offscreen, and hops down onto the sea bear's head], Spend an inordinate amount of time training several dozen sea bears to take over your restaurant and force you to give it up! ,[about eight more sea bears surround Mr. Krabs from all sides, all growling] Nothing, can turn them from their central purpose!
,SpongeBob:, ,[offscreen], Yoo-hoo! ,[the sea bears all turn to look at SpongeBob], Who wants their tummies tickled? ,[he has a playful look on his face and is making a tickling motion with his fingers],
,Plankton:, No... ,[the sea bears all smile excitedly and dash away, leaving Plankton floating in mid-air], My weapons! ,[he succumbs to gravity, and falls to the ground so hard he bounces a little], Ouch!
,SpongeBob:, ,[standing on top of a green sea bear and tickling his tummy], Sea bears aren't weapons, Plankton. ,[the sea bear is laughing uncontrollably and waving his front fins around wildly], They're furry buckets of love. ,[the sea bear starts slapping his tail on the ground, making SpongeBob giggle], See? ,[jumps off the sea bear's stomach to the other side of the dining room, causing his work hat to fall off], And what do sea bears love more than tummy tickles? ,[pulls a jellyfish hive out from behind his back and holds it above his head], Jellyfish honey!
,[Three sea bears, two green and one brown, see the hive and rush over to SpongeBob. The middle brown one already has on a pink bib with a jellyfish hive on it. SpongeBob pours the honey out of the hive onto his head and tosses the hive away; this makes the sea bears even more excited to the point of drooling. The middle one is rubbing his front fins together in anticipation, and the one on the right has hearts in his eyes and is flapping his fins up and down with his tongue out.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sing-song], Come and get it! ,[runs out of the Krusty Krab, smothered in honey; all the sea bears swim out after him, breaking through the door, sending wood and glass flying, and knocking down the rest of the maritime flags],
,Plankton:, ,[running after his sea bears], No! Come back! ,[sees Mr. Krabs approaching],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[angry, obviously], Why do you keep doing this, Plankton?
,Plankton:, ,[backing away], Heh-heh-heh... ,[falls down into a sitting position],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pointing a stern finger at Plankton], When you mess with me business, ya mess with me money! ,[clenches both claws furiously],
,Plankton:, ,[puts on a smile], Er, money's not everything, you know. ,[laughs nervously],
,Mr. Krabs:, 'Course it is! ,[seven dollar bills circle around his eyestalks], Money makes the world go round, and makes me heart go pound. ,[his heart becomes visible from his shirt, pounding in the shape of a dollar sign],
,Plankton:, ,[stands up, putting his hands on his hips], Well, if you love money so much, ,[mockingly], why don't you ,marry, it?
,[Mr. Krabs goes silent, then his mouth opens like a cash register, his lower jaw becoming a drawer divided into compartments, with silver and gold coins in the front one, and dollar bills in the back three; in the back of his throat a white tag with a red dollar sign on it pops up. He pushes his mouth closed.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sadly], If I could, I would.
,Plankton:, ,[getting an idea] Would, you now...? ,[laughs evilly while rubbing his hands together],
,Mr. Krabs:, You still here? ,[lifts Plankton by the antenna and pulls his left leg back],
,Plankton:, ,[startled], Yuhh! ,[Krabs kicks Plankton out of the Krusty Krab all the way across the street to the Chum Bucket], This gives me an idea. ,[pushes through the double doors of the Chum Bucket, and lands inside. There is a loud crash], Owww!
,[Bubble wipe to that night. Mr. Krabs has repaired most of the damage done by the sea bears, except for a gaping hole in the roof, a bite taken out of the left wall, and the front windows, which are still broken. He pushes one of the double doors open, and sighs. He is carrying a garbage bag.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ohh... another lonely evening... dumpin' trash... ,[He walks out of the Krusty Krab, over to two trash cans on the side of the road, one empty, and one overflowing with garbage bags. He lifts the lid of the empty one, drops his bag in, and closes it back.], ...alone. ,[he hears someone crying], Huh? ,[he looks around until he sees someone crying on a bench, illuminated by a street light; the ""BUS"" sign on the street light pole seems to give the implication that this a bus stop next to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs isn't sure what to do at first], Umm... ,[he decides to go over and see who it is], Hello? Miss?
,[To his surprise, it is a stack of dollar bills wearing lipstick and a red bow with yellow polka dots. She stops crying and looks up at him. She's beautiful, and has green eyes with eyelashes, and sparkles a little. Mr. Krabs is instantly attracted to her; he sticks his tongue out and his eyes bloat up, and together they form the shape of a throbbing heart. He makes a weird noise.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[handing the stack of money a tissue], Ooh, careful now, careful. ,[smiles], Your ink will run.
,[She giggles, and wipes her eyes with the tissue.],
,Cashina:, My, you're such a gentleman. ,[sniffles],
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh. ,[chuckling nervously while scratching the back of his head], Yeah, well... so, um... what's a nice denomination like ,youuu [points at her], doin'... on a bench like this?
,Cashina:, My date was supposed to bring me to the bank... ,[she starts to cry again], ...but he stood me up! ,[sobs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[outraged by this], What?? ,[pointing to himself], Hey, if I met the scallywag that stood you up, I'd knock him down. ,[he winds up and punches the street light next to him hard, then turns around and smiles proudly; the street light, subsequently, falls off the pole and comes crashing down onto his head], Dooh! ,[the light cover, which is shaped like a scallop, hinges open, revealing Mr. Krabs' face and making him look like he is wearing a knight's helmet],
,Cashina:, ,[as a fanfare plays], My knight in shining exoskeleton!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[quickly sliding onto the bench next to the money, looking at his claw and imitating James Bond], The name's Krabs... Eugene Krabs. ,[looks at her], And yours?
,Cashina:, ,[her cheeks blush a bright pink], Cashina. You're very sweet. ,[her eyes get all shiny],
,Mr. Krabs:, You know somethin'? ,[jumps off the bench and points at Cashina], You look like a million bucks when you smile. ,[Cashina giggles again; Mr. Krabs gets down onto one knee], Cashina, would you make this old crab's day ,[looks up and away anxiously], and allow me to take you to a place where you can buy me dinner? ,[smiles again],
,Cashina:, I'd love to...
,[Cashina's face becomes completely transparent as the rest of her darkens, revealing none other than Plankton inside, sitting on a chair and controlling Cashina by means of a lever, a control panel with buttons, a joystick, and a microphone on it, and a camera],
,Plankton:, ,[puts his hand over the microphone], ...scam you out of your secret formula, that is. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! ,[he laughs evilly as Cashina's face reappears; she covers her mouth as Plankton's laugh only comes out as a small giggle.],
,[Bubble wipe to the next scene. A green fish wearing a purple shirt walks down the road past Fancy!, a restaurant that looks like a huge ship in a bottle. Inside, elegant music plays as a waiter walks past carrying a covered platter and a bottle of wine with two glasses, along with a napkin. We zoom past some tables with fish seated at them talking, over to where Mr. Krabs and Cashina are laughing and enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs at a table with a checkered tabletop. Judging by all the noodles and meatballs piled inside Cashina, she has already ""eaten"" quite a lot. As Plankton struggles to pull another noodle in through Cashina's mouth hole, Krabs is slurping on the same noodle at the same time. The noodle gets tighter and tighter as he slurps more and more of it, to the point where Plankton can be seen almost falling out of Cashina's mouth for a second. He just manages to pull himself back in before Mr. Krabs sees him. The noodle bridging Cashina and Mr. Krabs' mouths gets so short, Mr. Krabs has to lean over the table and Cashina has to stand on top of the plate of spaghetti. Becoming desperate, Plankton pulls out a pair or scissors and cuts the noodle, sending both Cashina and Krabs flying in opposite directions.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa! Oof! ,[He lands on his chair, breaking it, and crashes to the floor. Meanwhile, Cashina lands on her back on the edge of the table so hard she starts sparking. Her left side becomes transparent, showing Plankton inside, being electrocuted. Mr. Krabs stands up.], Allow me. ,[pushes Cashina's legs down until she is sitting upright],
,Cashina:, This food is so delicious. Oop! You don't suppose it has a secret formula. ,[she stands up and flicks Mr. Krabs' nose flirtingly], I don't suppose ,you, know anything about secrets... or formulas.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh. I do have a very ,special, recipe...
,Cashina:, Yeeeess...?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[puts his arm around Cashina and slaps the plate off the table], ...for delicious kisses! ,[the plate can be heard shattering offscreen; inside Cashina, Plankton groans, then suddenly has to put his hand over his mouth to keep from throwing up. Mr. Krabs points to his lips], Cashina, would you mind if I kissed you?
,Cashina:, ,[smiles unsurely and turns around, one foot tiptoed], Oh, Eugene. This is all moving so fast...
,[inside Cashina],
,Plankton:, ,[covers up the microphone again so it won't pick up what he's saying], ...just as I planned. ,[chuckles],
,Cashina:, Be gentle! ,[they both lean in for the kiss; inside Cashina, Plankton presses a gray button on the control panel with a picture of pink lips on it],
,Robotic voice:, Purse lips.
,[Cashina's lips and a rectangular area surrounding them slide upward into Cashina, revealing another pair of lips on a rod which extends outward until Krabs' and Cashina's lips touch. Instantly both of them jump into the air as they jolt all over. After they finish kissing, both of them are charred and smoking.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[weakly], Wow, what a woman!
,[Inside Cashina, Plankton is charred and smoking too. He covers up the microphone again, and some slight feedback is heard.],
,Plankton:, Ugh. Well, I finally did it— I kissed a crab!
,[Bubble wipe to Mr. Krabs' anchor at night. The camera zooms in on his bedroom window. Cut to Mr. Krabs lying on his stomach on his hammock, giggling. He is holding and looking at a golden heart-shaped locket, but only the back of it can be seen at first. Krabs sighs dreamily and rolls over onto his back, then resumes giggling. We cut to a shot of the front of the locket, and finally get to see what he is looking at: the locket contains a picture of Cashina with one hand on her hip and the other fluffing her ""hair,"" on a magenta background with red hearts surrounding her.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[now sitting up], Oh, Cashina... ,[he kisses Cashina's picture... right as his daughter Pearl opens the door and steps into the room],
,Pearl:, ,[cheerfully], Daddy, I want to... ,[The background music stops with a record scratch. Mr. Krabs gasps and stops kissing the locket, but it's too late. He shifts his gaze to behind him and sees Pearl's smile fade and her eyes open wide.] EEWWWW! [her face turns from shock to disgust and she points an accusing finger at her father], Are you kissing a locket with a woman's picture in it?!
,[Krabs starts to sweat profusely.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[nervously shaking his head], Oh, no, no! ,[glances away to the right], I was, uh... ,[he holds up the locket, making sure Pearl only sees the back of it, and points to it], I was polishin'... this jewelry... with me... mouth hole... you see. ,[he sticks his tongue out as he speaks and points to his mouth, which now has red lips], Like this! ,[he closes his eyes, growing eyelashes, and kisses the locket several times], Right, hmm... ,[He puts the locket's chain around his neck, tucking the locket itself under his shirt to hide it from Pearl. He finishes by smiling goofily.],
,Pearl:, ,[screaming in Mr. Krabs' face, causing him to recoil somewhat] Gross! [storms angrily out of the room; her father gets down from the hammock and follows her],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pearl, me little beluga... ,[Pearl stops, turns around, and puts her flippers on her hips; Krabs scratches the back of his head again], I never thought I'd say this, but... ,[raises a claw and smiles], I may have found you a new mom.
,Pearl:, ,[shakes her head], No way! ,[starts pacing counterclockwise around Mr. Krabs with her flippers out], I have seen stepmoms in movies, Dad. She'll make me sweep up the cinders, and then she won't let me go to the ball! ,[she stops pacing], And then I'll ,never, meet my Prince Charming! ,[she starts bawling, and tears start spraying from her eyes like little waterfalls and flood the room],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pulls a string, which unplugs a cork stopper, thereby draining the ocean of tears Pearl cried and leaving behind a few puddles], Ya know, we're gonna have to have another talk about fantasy and reality.
,Pearl:, ,[who has stopped crying by now, but is still worried], Okay... then what's she like?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[nervously], Well, she's... ,[A cash register ding is heard, and Mr. Krabs grins and his eyes get huge and shiny. He is surrounded by twinkling stars and dollar signs], ...everything I've ever wanted in a woman.
,Pearl:, ,[offscreen], Blech!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sees Pearl crossing her arms and snaps out of it], Oh, don't worry, sweetie. Nothing will ever come between us. ,[He scuttles over and starts petting her on the nose. Pearl smiles. Just then, the doorbell rings, and Mr. Krabs gasps excitedly.], She's here! Out of me way! ,[Pearl does not get out of the way in time, and her dad rushes past her so quickly that she spins around rapidly before slowing to a stop and flopping down on her back. Mr. Krabs gets to the front door and opens it for Cashina.], Hello, me little money stack. ,[he walks her over to the table where Pearl is already sitting in a blue metal chair, looking rather upset], I want you to meet me daughter, Pearl. ,[he sits in a plain chair, while Cashina hops up onto a barrel topped with a round red throw cushion],
,Cashina:, ,[awkwardly], Pearl, I... love your rouge. ,[points at it], How chic!
,Pearl:, ,[not amused], It's actually a rash. ,[she has a rash that looks like rouge on the left side and continuing about a third of the way across the front side of her nose],
,Plankton:, ,[inside Cashina, starting to sweatdrop], Uhhhh... Teen Talk, Teen Talk... ,[he picks up a purple magazine with the red words ""TEEN TALK"" on a yellow background on the front cover, and fries through the pages], Ah. Girls like shoes.
,[while Plankton has been consulting his Teen Talk magazine, Cashina's face has become frozen in a weird expression, but it pops back to normal.],
,Cashina:, ,[pointing at Pearl's boots], Well, Pearl, I love your shoes.
,Pearl:, ,[getting mad, crossing her arms], I'm not wearing shoes. Those are barnacles. ,[a quick shot of Pearl's feet reveal that Pearl is indeed not wearing her white boots right now; she does, however, have white barnacles covering her back fins that look like boots from a distance],
,Cashina:, Oh, uh... heh... ,[raises her finger], I have some cream for that.
,Pearl:, ,[explodes], Stop trying to mom at me, lady! ,[She bangs on the table with both fists so hard that Cashina and Mr. Krabs both bounce in their seats. Pearl looks away and crosses her arms.], I don't need youuu!
,Cashina:, ,[becoming a little concerned], Well, Pearl, since I'm seeing your father, I hope we can learn to understand each other.
,Pearl:, ,[points at Cashina], You'll ,never, understand me! ,[gets up so fast she knocks her chair over], In fact, I'm going to make it a point to never be understandable again! ,[she walks over to the bathroom doorway, but turns back and points at Cashina again], Blarb snobble goober ,blaaab!,
,[On the word ""blab,"" she stomps her foot as hard as she can, causing the screen to shake briefly, and runs into the bathroom. Mr. Krabs sighs as Cashina jumps up onto the table.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me talk to her.
,Cashina:, ,[holds her hand out as if she's saying ""stop""], No. I think I should do this alone.
,[she ruffles her ""hair""; bubble wipe to Krabs pacing back and forth in the living room],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[groaning], Oh... I haven't been this nervous since me first boatswain's ball. ,[he is startled when he sees Pearl and Cashina descending the stairs into the living room],
,Cashina:, ,[telling Pearl a story], ...and I was all, ""You call this a mugging?"" And then I suplexed him until he gave me my purse back! ,[they both hug each other and laugh hysterically],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walking over to them with his claws on his hips], Hey-hey, you two! How about inviting me into your inside joke? Eh?
,Pearl:, Oh, you wouldn't get it, Dad. It's a "",giiirl, thing.""
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks closer to Cashina and gets onto one knee again while bowing, surprising Cashina], Cashina, you know I love ya. ,[looks up at Pearl], And now me daughter loves ya too. Will you marry me, Cashina?
,[Cashina studies Mr. Krabs' face. He is biting his lip and looks almost desperate, almost pleading. Pearl smiles really big excitedly, hoping Cashina will say ""yes."" Cut to inside Cashina.],
,Plankton:, ,[clenching his teeth, also excited], Eeeeeeee...
,[Back to Mr. Krabs' face.],
,Cashina:, ,[holding her arms out], Yes! Yes! ,Yes!,
,[Pearl clasps her fins to the sides of her face. Three hot-pink hearts with dollar bills inside them appear floating above Mr. Krabs. Cut to inside Cashina],
,Plankton:, Perfect! ,[lifts his finger up high in the air], When we're married, he'll ,have, to tell me the secret formula! ,[laughs evilly, then fist-pumps], Yeah!
,[Bubble wipe to the Krusty Krab sometime later, possibly even the next day. The exterior of the building has already been decorated for the wedding. A red carpet leads to the entrance, which is surrounded by colorful lights that have been strung all the way around the Krusty Krab and even around the pole of the sign, which has a silver diamond ring sitting in the bottom part of the clamshell. The maritime flags hanging above the door and windows have been replaced by a white banner with small red hearts painted all over it; the banner is supported in the center by two big hearts— the bigger one is red, and the smaller one which is in front of the bigger one is closer to pinkish-red. Last but not least, some red, pink, and light blue balloons are tied to the chimney. A few boatmobiles are already parked out front, including a white limousine with yellow porthole Windows and a yellow spoiler, which is presumably for Mr. Krabs and Cashina. The whole scene zooms in slightly.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[from inside], SpongeBob! You're gonna be me wedding planner.
,[cut to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob inside the former's office],
,SpongeBob:, ,[removes his work hat, puts his legs together, and bows], I'm so honored, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Great! ,[holds up a dollar as a cash register dings], Here's your budget.
,[he hands the dollar to SpongeBob, who takes it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[stretches the dollar with both hands, then lets it go, causing it to make a snapping sound, and holds it up high], Mr. Krabs, I am gonna stretch this dollar until it begs for mercy! ,[he sees Mr. Krabs walk up to him looking rather offended, and starts playing with the dollar nervously], No... disrespect for your new bride.
,[Cut to five onions, four heads of lettuce, six tomatoes, six Krabby Patty patties, and three different kinds of cheese sitting on a table that has been decorated with a white tablecloth. SpongeBob chops all of this up with his spatula, turning it into an amazing centerpiece with blue ribbon sticking out of it and a golden trident in the center. In a wider shot, we can see that SpongeBob has already decorated a few tables the same way. As Squidward, wearing a top hat with a red band and a wedding tuxedo with a red bowtie, puts a white tablecloth over a bare table, SpongeBob, in an outfit similar to Squidward's, tops the centerpiece with a whole tomato, then stands back and admires his work with a big smile on his face. Pink ribbon can be seen strung around a pole along with green confetti, with more pink ribbon hanging from the ceiling. A white banner with small red hearts on it, similar to the one outside, is also hung from the ceiling. After a second, SpongeBob runs away laughing. Just then, Patrick appears, dressed in a top hat with a purple band and a black bowtie, along with his shorts. He is also wearing white cuffs. He is carrying a plate stacked with plates and glasses, but is also rolling backwards on a wooden barrel. Squidward does not care and continues with his tablecloth.],
,Patrick:, ,[struggling to stay on the barrel], Huh, hee, whooah-oh-hoo-hoo...!
,[SpongeBob flings a few plain patties onto a banner and the words ""Krabs + Cashina"" are spelled on screen. SpongeBob splats some ketchup in a cup. Then he takes that same cup and then gets a cup of mustard in his other hand.],
,SpongeBob:, Would you like our house red or or house yellow? ,[laughs],
,[Afer they finish making the wedding decorations, the scene fades to the wedding going on.]
,Wedding Manager:, And now, the couple will exchange their vow.
,Cashina:, Eugene, you have everything I've ever wanted with a man: An exoskeleton, freakishly long eyestalks, and the secret krabby patty formula.
,Audience:, Aww...
,Mr. Krabs:, Cashina, you gave it to my life, but I thought I'd leave the rest of it alone. You showed me once and for all: If money can't buy you love, it can give you love.
,Audience:, Aww...
,Wedding Manager:,  You may now kiss the bride. [They kiss each other and get electrocuted again. The audience goes wild]
,Cashina:, Oh no, what about the bouquet?
,SpongeBob:, Uh... One bouquet coming up, Mrs. Krabs [He steals some flowers from the crowd and makes a bouquet and Cashina throws it to Patrick, causing him to eat it.]
,Patrick:,  ,[laughs with his mouth full], Hooray! I win! ,[he belches loudly],
,[All the women start bawling, while a bloated Mrs. Puff just sits there sadly. Scene bubble transitions to Mr. Krabs dancing with Cashina.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[As Patrick picks his teeth with a toothpick], It's a shame Plankton couldn't be here.
,Plankton:, ,[inside Cashina], Ugh... Uhh... Uhh! Who knew Eugene was so light on his crab legs? ,[He vomits. Bubble transitions to ,Honeymoon Hotel,, Mr. Krabs and Cashina's car pull up and they enter the hotel, into a room. Mr. Krabs takes off his tie and goes over to Cashina, who is on top of two pillows],
,Cashina:, Eugene, I don't want there to be any secrets between us.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, what? Oh, I'll tell you everything. No matter how embarrassed, I went to bed until I was 40. My armpits smell like tartar sauce when I'm afraid.
,Cashina:, Not those kinds of secrets.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, OK. Whatever you want, me sweet. Just ask.
,Cashina:, I want you to tell me... (scheming smile face) the secret Krabby Patty formula!
,Mr. Krabs:, The what?
,Cashina:, The secret formula... is locked away in your heart. Unlock your heart for me, Eugene. Let me in
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, anything for you, baby. (He looks in both directions, Left and Right) I'm gonna whisper it to you, just in case there's any prying ears out there.
,Plankton:, Oh boy, here it comes!
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, me sweet. Here it is. (He starts to get emotional) Ugh. I'm gettin' a little emotional. While, I never told anyone the secret... Krabby Patty formula before. ,[Cashina grins in anticipation], So, here goes. ,[he takes a deep breath, about to tell her the formula, but then grimaces as a tear falls from his eye], Erngh. ,[His tear falls into Cashina's mouth, causing her to explode and reveal Plankton inside a robot.],
,Plankton:, (Girl voice) Come on, Krabs ,[The voice starts to fade away into his normal voice], Let it all out! ,[Realizes Mr. Krabs sees him],
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton?!
,Plankton:, No, no, I'm not Plankton ,[Tries to cover himself with a part of the robot. Imitating Cashina], I'm Cashina, you're blushing bride. I.. uh... uh... Am I blushing?
,Mr. Krabs:, You... monster! ,[He is about to crush Plankton but stops and groans loudly],
,Plankton:, You're not gonna crush me?
,Mr. Krabs:, I've been alone for so long, and for the first time in forever, I felt for someone. Well, I mean something: A pile of cash with lips. It was all too good to be true. Cashina may have not been real, but me feelings were, weren't they?
,Plankton:, Get a hold of yourself, Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton, are you saying it was all just a scheme to you? And you felt nothing?
,Plankton:, You're crazy! I'm out of here, and one day, the formula will be mine! Mark it. ,[He exits. Mr. Krabs scoops up some of the remains of Cashina in each of his claws and holds them close to his face, trying not to cry. He cries anyway. A doorman enters the room.],
,Doorman:, Oh, hey buddy. I want you to know: although your wife just ran out on you, you still have to tip me.,[He puts all the cash into his suit, grabs a nickel and throws it. He catches it with his soup and makes a dazed face at it. The episode ends.],

"[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is peeking through his window with his binoculars.],

,[At Patrick's house, Patrick is also peeking around with his binoculars.],
,Patrick:, ,[imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie], Uh...I've got a visual on an old lady tying her shoes. ,[slides down his house; whispers], She's doing the old granny knot.
,Old Lady:, Oh, I'll give you a granny knot!
,Patrick:, ,[grunts as he flips over], All clear! No crime here.
,[The old lady snatches the wallet from Patrick's pocket with her teeth and hops away. Squidward walks out of his house with luggage.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[imitates static], Patrick, emergency meeting at Squidward's house—ASAP! ,[he and Patrick stop in front of Squidward on their knees], Oh please, Squidward, don't move away! You can't leave the neighborhood! Aw, we were just starting to get close. ,[whimpers],
,Patrick:, ,[grabs Squidward and hugs him tightly; he inhales], I swear, I'll haunt your nightmares if you move away!
,Squidward:, ,[pushes Patrick away], I'm not moving away, you brainless bottom feeders!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick suck and eat the sand like bottom feeders.],
,Squidward:, I'm just taking a week's vacation away from you morons.
,SpongeBob:, ,[squeals as he jumps in Squidward's arms and whispers in his ear], Thank you.
,[Squidward drops SpongeBob to the ground.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs Squidward's suitcase], Let me help you carry this.
,Squidward:, No—wait, no!
,[SpongeBob and Squidward pull the suitcase open and all of Squidward's belongings fly everywhere.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[removes underwear off his head], Oh—your unmentionables.
,[Squidward swats the underwear away in anger.],
,Patrick:, I won't mention is bra.
,Squidward:, It's not a bra! It's a pectoral girdle. I don't care about my clothes. I just wanna get away from you two. And while I'm away—huh...
,[Patrick tries on some of Squidward's clothes, but it rips onto SpongeBob's face. Squidward gets really angry and his head explodes like a bomb.],
,Squidward:, ,[packs his suitcase], While I am gone, there will be a paying guest renting my place. Don't bother him! ,[leaves],

,[The passenger comes out of the taxi, which turns out to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis, Man Ray.],
,TV Announcer:, Who's this tacky tourist turning up in taxi? Why, it's none other than that mortal enemy of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, the evil Man Ray!
,Man Ray:, Hey, dude, keep it down. I'm not doing any evil this week. I'm on vacation!

,Man Ray:, Yes, really. ,[hums cheerfully as he enters Squidward's house],

,Patrick:, ,[squeals quietly], We can blast him out. ,[holds up a huge TNT dynamite],
,SpongeBob:, No, no! Squidward said not to bother the man. ,[Patrick throws away the dynamite], So, we gotta be sneaky.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick sneak behind Squidward's house to take a look at Man Ray. Patrick pounds on the window.],
,SpongeBob:, Shh! He must've gone upstairs.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick run back to the front of Squidward's house.],
,Patrick:, Well, how do we get up there?
,SpongeBob:, ""Eye"" have just the thing! ,[giggles and grabs his right eye], Ow!
,[SpongeBob swings his eye, throws it, and ties it to an open window. Inside, Man Ray is sleeping on Squidward's chair and feels a cold breeze of wind.],
,Man Ray:, ,[shivers], Oh, it's getting chilly.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Man Ray slams the window on SpongeBob's eye], Ow! ,[groans weakly; Man Ray slams the window on SpongeBob's eye again], D'ow! ,[SpongeBob pulls his eye down to avoid getting slammed on by the window], Ow! ,[SpongeBob reels his eye back on his face], Oof! ,[his eye is completely flat like a pancake; he yelps when he blinks it], Ow.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick ringing the doorbell while bringing a pie.],
,SpongeBob:, Now, I know Squidward said not to bother his guest, but there's nothing wrong with a welcome-to-the-neighborhood pie. ,[giggling squeals],
,Man Ray:, ,[answers the door], Oh! May I help you? I was just finishing up in the bathroom.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hands Man Ray the pie], Hello. Welcome to the neighborhood! ,[enters Squidward's house],

,Man Ray:, Is this sand?
,Patrick:, Hamper sand—from my hamper.
,Man Ray:, ,[quietly], Ugh!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, stranger, we got a nice little town here—thanks to the Junior Crime Breakers. And we're always looking for new members. You look pretty fit.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob. He's not putting out any snacks for us.
,Man Ray:, Oh, sorry! How rude of me. Hmm...ooh! All I have is this pie.
,Patrick:, Don't mind if I do.
,[Patrick grabs the sand pie, eats it, and swallows it. After swallowing it, he smiles and sand falls out from his teeth.],
,Man Ray:, Eh—if you'll excuse me, I'll finish up in the bathroom. ,[heads upstairs],
,Patrick:, ,[pants], He's all outta snacks! ,[throws the pie plate away], Let's go.
,SpongeBob:, But, Patrick, we haven't asked him to join the Junior Crime Breakers yet. Hello, we were wondering if you'd like to—,[screams],
,[SpongeBob pulls out his comic book and frantically looks through the pages. He realizes that the paying guest that is renting Squidward's house is actually Man Ray. Man Ray is finishing sprucing himself up in the bathroom.],

,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute, Patrick. We're both wrong! It says right here in issue 55. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are just taking their cryonic nap. But when they wake up in a week, they'll be weak for a week! ,[SpongeBob leaps towards Patrick], Patrick, do you know what this means?
,Patrick:, I'll have to wait a week for my Mermaid Man ice pop?
,SpongeBob:, Yes and no. It means that you and I will have to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and stop Man Ray's vacation of...,[thunder claps], Evil!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[grabs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's rings], By the power of Neptune, Mermaid Pants and Barnacle Star unite!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick unite the rings and disappear in a loud explosion. The results of the explosion causes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to abruptly wake up from their cryonic nap.

,[The ceiling cracks.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[looking through a lava lamp], Who'da thunk that Squidward would be stockpiling such a huge arsenal of evil super-weapons? ,[throws away the lava lamp and bites into some stale cookies until his teeth shatter], So stale, yet so deadly.
,[Patrick steps back and trips over a bowling ball. He lands on one of Squidward's pictures and gets it caught in his buttocks.],
,Patrick:, I got my weapon!

,[Patrick charges towards Man Ray and attacks him while holding onto his head, causing him to fall over and break a table.],
,TV Announcer:, Table toppled!
,[Outside Squidward's house, the sky is roaring with thunder and the clouds are pitch black. Man Ray jumps through the roof and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out.],
,Man Ray:, I just wanted a vacation!
,SpongeBob:, Evil never takes a vacation!
,Man Ray:, ,[stammers], Did you just make that up? Because that sounds pretty good. Do you mind if I use it sometime?
,SpongeBob:, Help yourself, Man Ray.
,Patrick:, Yeah, help yourself to pain! ,[thunder claps],
,Man Ray:, ,[face palms himself and groans], Why did I ever bother trying to be normal? ,[rips off his tourist clothing], I am Man Ray! Feel my evil wrath!

,Man Ray:, Hold on. I should get this. ,[answers phone], Hello?
,Squidward:, Hello, Man Ray? The weather changed my plans. I'm coming home. ,[grunts as the wind attempts to pull him], Not to worry, though. You'll get a full refund on the rent, so long as there is no damage to my place. ,[Man Ray hangs up], Hello?
,Man Ray:, ,[laughs evilly], That idiot octopus doesn't know I gave him a phony check! ,[smashes the phone with his fist and heads out the door], You were right about me after all, dopey duo. Evil never takes a vacation!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! Definitely sounds a lot cooler when he says it.
,Man Ray:, ,[hears a horn honking], Ah, here's my Scuber. ,[runs out, climbs on the scuba-diver and drives away],
,SpongeBob:, Maybe one day Man Ray will reform and join the Junior Crime Breakers. ,[gets hit in the head by a board], Huh?
,[Squidward's house is completely trashed up from the battle.],
,Patrick:, Man, he really trashed this place.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Barnacle Star! Let's be super good and glue all of Squidward's stuff back together!
,Patrick:, Well, how do we do that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckling], Oh, Patrick, it's right here in issue 14. ,[slurps], We have super saliva!

,Patrick:, ,[glues a cactus together with his saliva], Ow!
,[SpongeBob glues some stairs together with his saliva. Patrick wrings out saliva from his tongue and dumps it in a bucket. Then he throws the bucket of saliva onto some broken furniture and magically repairs them. Moments later, Squidward enters the house.],

,Mr. Pepalino:, ,[gargling],
,Mr. Pepalino:, We're not hiring.
,Nocturna:, Welcome to Scorched Coral. Please go away. Oh, hey, Pearl. What are you doing here?
,Pearl:, I would like to apply for a job, please.
,Nocturna:, Yeah, sorry. You're a little late. We were hiring, but we actually just hired someone today.
,Pearl:, Ah!
,Pearl:, Oh, Nixie, I need to work at Dangles and Bangles. This is my last chance. You gotta help me out here. Oh, please, please, please, please, please!
,Nixie:, Come on, let me introduce you to the manager. This is--
,Bangles and Dangles manager:, Nope, not hiring.
,Pearl:, You don't understand. I have to work here!
,Bangles and Dangles manager:, Sorry, missy, the only thing we don't dangle here... is hope.
,Pearl:, Oh, bangles. Ah... ,[belches], Oh, this is the worst. If I don't get a job at the mall, I'm gonna have to hang out with my dad. ,[sighs],
,Beatrice:, You looking for a job, deary?
,Pearl:, Yeah! I need one as soon as possible. It's a life or death situation, actually.
,Beatrice:, Oh, my goodness. Are you in danger?
,Pearl:, In danger of never seeing my friends 'cause I don't have a job.
,Beatrice:, Come with me.
,Pearl:, ,[gasps as she follows], Weird. I've never been in this part of the mall before. ,[gasps], Ugh! What's that smell?
,Beatrice:, Oh, probably one of the many perfumes that we sell here at Grandma's Apron! Congratulations! You're hired.
,Pearl:, ,[gasps], Oh, this is the best day of my life!
,Beatrice:, ,[groaning], Ah! ,[back pops], Well, I can't quite afford to be picky these days. The only other employee besides me was Myrtle, and she's... no longer with us.
,Both:, ,[shrieks],
,Myrtle:, Almost forget my shades! See ya later, suckers! ,[laughing],
,Marina:, Hey, Pearl. Over here.
,Nocturna:, Did you find a job?
,Pearl:, Yeah, I got a job at Grandma's Apron.
,Marina:, ,[laughing], Pearl, you cannot be serious.
,Nocturna:, Ew, that store is for old people.
,Nixie:, ,[laughing], Old people are so... old.
,Pearl:, Old people aren't that bad. Are they?
,All:, ,[laughter],
,Marina:, Hey, girls. I smell moth balls.
,Pearl:, Well, we are having a sale on them. They're 25% off today.
,Nocturna:, Um, isn't it your nap time, Pearl?
,Nixie:, Where's your muumuu, granny?
,All:, ,[laughter],
,Beatrice:, Oh, don't let those bubble-headed nincompoops get to you, Pearly.
,Pearl:, But it's not fair.
,Beatrice:, Life's not fair, my dear. We all go through hard times at some point. Here, look. See? I was different from the other girls, and they teased me for it. They called me ""Boring Beatrice."" Not very creative, those girls. ,[chuckles while showing a picture],
,Pearl:, Who would even take a picture of that?
,Beatrice:, Oh, good ol' Jonesy from the AV Club took that one!
,Pearl:, Wait, but who took that picture--
,Beatrice:, All that matters, Pearly, my dear, is that things will soon change. But in the meantime, you should be having as much fun as possible. Let me show you how grandmas do it.
,Both:, ,[laughter],
,Pearl:, Whoa, come back here, yarn! ,[panting],
,All:, ,[gasp, when Pearl walks over],
,Marina:, ,[laughing], Love the shoes, Pearl.
,Pearl:, You guys just don't get it. Being a grandma is fun. I get to sit in a rocking chair, dust tchotchkes, bake cookies, knite mittens, hats, and scarves.
,All:, ,[laughter],
,Nocturna:, Scarves.
,Pearl:, It's actually, like, the most coral store in the whole mall, so you can all just... just... eat barnacles!
,All:, ,[laughter],
,Beatrice:, Now, now. Girls. Let's be polite.
,Marina:, What are you gonna do about it, granny? ,[grunting menacingly],
,Beatrice:, Granny power! Power! Power! ,[echoing],
,Marina:, ,[screams],
,All:, ,[screaming],
,Beatrice:, Pearl, toss me the Autumn Years perfume.
,Pearl:, Hi-ya!
,All:, ,[screaming],
,Marina:, It smells like pills and bed pans. Whoa!
,Beatrice:, ,[laughing],
,All:, ,[whimpering],
,Beatrice:, Well, now that you're all sitting down, let me tell you about the first time I ever saw a talking picture show. Oh, boy, did they know how to talk.
,Nixie:, No, please! I can't take anymore!
,Marina:, It's... so... boring.
,Nocturna:, No, I hate the past.
,Narrator:, One hour later...
,Beatrice:, And that's why today, we all wear shoes.
,Marina:, Okay, okay, We get it. We will stop being mean, I promise. Just let us go.
,All:, Whoa! ,[groaning],
,Marina:, Listen, Pearl. We didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything. We just, like, think it's weird that you're, like, a grandma now or whatever. We don't really get it.
,Pearl:, Well, I don't care what you think anymore anyway. I'm being true to myself, and--and that's all that matters!
,All:, Eh.
,Pearl:, I'm a grandma now. Right, Beatrice?
,Beatrice:, Oh, Pearl, I'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point.
,Beatrice:, You're only young once, you see. You don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun.
,Pearl:, I guess you're right. Being a grandma is nice and all, but I do miss being a super hip young person.
,Beatrice:, Go have yourself some fun, my dear. Ah, ah, ah, ah. How 'about a nice, gentle handshake instead? ,[groans],
,Pearl:, Hey, wait up, guys! I want to be friends while I'm still young!
,Beatrice:, I'll see you tomorrow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[appears], You dropped this.

"Frankie Billy:, Excuse me, a patty for the lady please.
,Squidward:, Try reading the sign, Casanova.
,[Frankie tries to read the sign, but he can't],
,Evelyn:, You never learned to read, did you?
,Frankie Billy:, ,[sulks], No.
,Evelyn:, That's all right, neither did I!
,Frankie Billy:, We were meant for each other! ,[they walk away happily],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], Even the illiterate are finding love. ,[takes out a book], Oh, Squidward, why are you torturing yourself with tales of romance? ,[tosses the book away and it lands in SpongeBob's eye],
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes the book out of his eye], Squidward! ,[puts the book on his tongue], You dropped your ook!
,Squidward:, That's no ""ook"". That's just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and likely to remain that way forever.
,SpongeBob:, Don't be sad, buddy. Turn that frown upside down! ,[flips Squidward's head],
,Squidward:, I prefer my frowns in their traditional orientation. ,[flips his head back to normal],
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps in front of Squidward], Just remember, Squidward. You have never experienced true love. BUT that doesn't mean you will never find it! You know the saying: There's a squid for every pot!
,Squidward:, Great, let the tired cliches cascade forward. ,[sarcastically], That'll make me feel better.
,[Squilvia walks inside and Squidward gasps],
,Squidward:, ,[bashes into SpongeBob and picks him up as he looks at her], Who-who is that? She's got da-da-da-da-da... ,[melts], She's, wow!
,Squilvia:, I absolutely adore the decor! Exquisitely minimalist!
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], She speaks art jargon!
,Squilvia:, What culinary delights doth this menu hold?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, she's got it all! Class, style, grace, ,[shows a caricature of Squilvia's face. Elephant sounds are hesrd.], ..and looks only matched by yours truly!
,SpongeBob:, Well, why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?
,Squidward:, My next move exactly! Observe the old Tentacles charm in all its glory! ,[tries to speak to her, but becomes nervous],
,Squilvia:, Is that Salmonese?
,SpongeBob:, Boy, you are floundering up there!
,Squidward:, I don't know what I'm doing! I've never felt like this before.
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Squiddy, you've been bitten by the love bug!
,Squilvia:, Hello! Hello? I'd like to order.
,Squidward:, She's talking to me. What do I do?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, I can help you attract your true love!
,Squidward:, You!? You don't know the first thing about the fine art of romance!
,Squilvia:, Well, since no one wants to take my order, I'll go elsewhere. ,[begins to leave],
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], She's leaving!
,SpongeBob:, Oh no she's not! Hang on, buddy! ,[cranks up the boat and it moves in front of Squilvia],
,Squilvia:, Finally, some service around here.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Idward Squay. 'Emeber ray the eat day. ,[Squidward falls over], I believe Squidward here is trying to ask you on a romantic date, ma'am. Right, Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[tries to talk, but is constantly feeling romance],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Squidward. Shake the nice lady's hand and say ""Hello.""
,Squilvia:, Hello. ,[shakes Squidward's hand], My name is Squilvia. Uh... is he okay?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yes. He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic. ,[Squidward falls over again], So, what do you think? You want to date him?
,Squilvia:, Uh... I don't know. I'm not too sure...
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute! Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend, Squidward. Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know.
,Squilvia:, Intelligent?
,SpongeBob:, That's right! We are talking some serious credentials.
,Squilvia:, ,[reads off certificate], L.A.M.E.? What school is that?
,SpongeBob:, The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress.
,Squilvia:, Really? Wow. He really said that?
,SpongeBob:, You betcha! He's such a charmer.
,Squidward:, ,[to SpongeBob], Don't forget artistic and musical.
,SpongeBob:, Not to mention that he's an incredible painter, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too. ,[Squidward shows a painting of muscular Squidward, shows his playing the clarinet, shows delicious fricassee, cleans SpongeBob with a feather-duster, and waters a flower.],
,Squilvia:, Oh, he sounds interesting!
,SpongeBob:, But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward? ,[teary-eyed], It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level. So, how does dinner at 8:00 sound, Squilvia?
,Squilvia:, I think that sounds perfect. I'll come by your place, okay?
,Squidward:, Uh-huh.
,Squilvia:, See you at 8:00, Squidward. ,[walks away. Squidward floats away and SpongeBob grabs him],
,SpongeBob:, You okay, buddy. You froze up there, buddy.
,Squidward:, ,[Head is in a block of ice, which breaks], What do you mean?
,SpongeBob:, I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?
,Squidward:, ,[remembers his last date], SpongeBob, you've gotta help me! It's been so long! What do I do?
,SpongeBob:, You, my friend, are in desperate need of a practice date.
,Squidward:, That's it! I'll go on... ,[voice quiets down], a practice date? I don't get it.
,SpongeBob:, Just meet me at my house at 5:00, Squidward.
,[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's house. Squidward rings the doorbell],
,SpongeBob:, ,[female voice], Just one minute, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[sulks a little a look at his watch], Sometime today would be nice.
,SpongeBob:, ,[dressed as Squilvia. female voice], I'm ready!
,Squidward:, ,[screams], Dear Neptune!
,SpongeBob:, Oh! ,[smacks his nose, making it bigger, and tilts it down], Missed a spot! ,[regular voice], Aren't you going to compliment my outfit?
,Squidward:, Um...You look...stunning?
,SpongeBob:, ,[female voice], Oh, you're so sweet! Where are my flowers?
,Squidward:, What! Oh! Um. Did you drop your lip balm!
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks down as Squidward buys some flowers], I don't think I've dropped anything... Ooh! You shouldn't have.
,Squidward:,  Oh, but I wanted to!
,SpongeBob:, No, you really shouldn't have. It's just that I'm very... I'm very aller... ,[sneezes on Squidward], ...very allergic to tulips. Anyway, are you ready to go?
,Squidward:, Go where?
,SpongeBob:, To dinner, silly.
,Squidward:, Oh, right! I'll get my car. ,[arrives with his boat], Hop in! ,[SpongeBob clears his throat], What?
,SpongeBob:, ,[regular voice], A gentlemen always opens a door for a lady.
,Squidward:, ,[opens the door], Oh, where are my manners!? ,[SpongeBob gets in, and Squidward buckles his seatbelt], Alrighty, so... ,[SpongeBob is struggling with his seatbelt], Can I help you with that?
,SpongeBob:, No, no, I've got it!
,Squidward:, ,[takes the seatbelt and buckles it], Would you get- There!
,SpongeBob:, Ah, snug.
,Squidward:, Uh-huh. Can we go now?
,SpongeBob:, Yes.
,Squidward:, Great.
,SpongeBob:, Right after I tinkle. ,[unbuckles seatbelt, walks inside, and rings a bell before returning to the car], Oh good thing i went, i don’t think i would’ve made it to the restaurant. Is something wrong Squidward?
,Squidward:, No! Just hungry that’s all.
,SpongeBob:, Great, well I know a fabulous place! Just head this way.
,Squidward:, Wonderful.
,SpongeBob:, Okay now at this stop sign turn right.
,Squidward:, Okay.
,SpongeBob:, Now at this light make a right.
,Squidward:, Gotcha.
,SpongeBob:, Now at this street here make a right. And at this intersection here make a right, and then park right near the orange building just up ahead. Ooh! We're here!
,Squidward:, You're a real piece of work, you know that?
,SpongeBob:, Oh why, thank you, Mr. Squidward! ,[regular voice], Way to compliment the date, Squidward.
,[Bubble transition],
,SpongeBob:, Now, it's the chit-chat part of the date. Amuse her with an interesting conversation.
,Squidward:, Oh... Um... Chit-chat... Can you believe this weather we're having?
,SpongeBob:, Okay, good effort, but you might want to start with something more personal. A woman may like to talk about her day, for example. She may want to talk about her promotion at work, or the wacky antics of her pet snail, or talk about how I was nearly late for our date because I couldn't decide what to wear, and then I didn't really have enough cash to give the lady at the nail salon. ,[shows SpongeBob's red painted nails],
,Squidward:, Urrgh!
,Patrick:, ,[clears throat], Dinner is served.
, ,SpongeBob: ,Oh! I'm famished! ,[Patrick gives SpongeBob and Squidward a plate of meatloaf.],
,Patrick:, ,[to Squidward], Don't try to eat it. It's plastic.
,SpongeBob:, Now this is the perfect opportunity to work on your table etiquette.
,SpongeBob:, ,[female voice], Squidward, could you please pass the roasted kelp? ,[Squidward tries to pass the kelp, but Patrick gives it to him],
,Patrick:, ,[Passes kelp to SpongeBob], Here you go, ma'am!
,SpongeBob:, Oh thank you, sir!
,Patrick:, Hey, Squidward, who's the lovely lady sitting across from you? I think she's giving me the cutesy eye!
,Squidward:, Oh, no you don't, Patrick! You cannot just barge across like this! SpongeBob and I are in the middle of a practice date!
,Patrick:, ,[to SpongeBob], So, do you hang out here often?
,SpongeBob:, Well, this is my home, silly. ,[giggles],
,Squidward:, Excuse me, but how is this supposed to help me with my real date? ,[looks at watch], Which, by the way begins in five minutes. ,[walks down stairs angrily mumbling],
,SpongeBob:, ,[regular voice], Squidward, wait! We haven't covered... ,[gets lipstick], We haven't covered all the tenants of ,Dating 101, yet! ,[trips and falls downstairs, and bumps into Squidward, causing his head to get stuck in the door], As I was saying... I, I would like to go over just a few more crucial aspects of the first date. ,[The door melts off Squidward, who becomes angry], Such as...
,[Squidward grabs SpongeBob’s mouth],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! Would you please just shut it and leave me alone?
,SpongeBob:, Um, Squidward..
,Squidward:, Don't ""um, Squidward"" me, you, you annoying, insignificant, waste of my time!
,SpongeBob:, Um, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Don't interrupt me! And don't call me, look at me, write me, or even think of me! ‘Cause you and I, we are not friends! And never will be.
,SpongeBob:, Does this mean there won't be a second date?
,[Squidward walks and sees Squilvia],
,Squidward:, Um, you saw that, didn't you?
,Squilvia:, Oh, only all of it.
,Squidward:, And you probably think I'm a mean-spirited brute, which, ironically, is the exact opposite of what you were expecting, right?
,Squilvia:, Not exactly.
,Squidward:, Huh?
,Squilvia:, I think a guy who doesn't suffer fools lightly is totally dreamy. Let's go eat!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I'm dreamy!
,[Squilvia pulls Squidward away so they can go eat],
,SpongeBob:, Have fun, you two! SquarePants, your work here is done.
,Patrick:, ,[dressed as a woman], Not quite! I was promised a movie, and some plastic popcorn.

,Squidward:, ,[singing his vintage, ""la-da-dee, la-da-do, la-da-dum], 20 minutes in the bath seems like enough. ,[has wrinkly hands], ,[sighs in excitement], Another day! ,[groans], Another day.
,SpongeBob:, ,[falls down the stairs like in "",Missing Identity,""], Ready for work! ,[walks to Squidward], Good morning, Squidward, I... ,[spots he's still wearing his underwear], ,[gasps], Not ready for work! ,[falls down the stairs again like in "",Missing Identity,""],
,Squidward:, Whatever.
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up to Squidward], Thanks for waiting, Squidward.
,Squidward:, I wasn't waiting.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.
,Squidward:, Yes, I saw that.
,SpongeBob:, I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?
,Squidward:, Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!
,SpongeBob:, I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut! ,[Squidward stops moving] [SpongeBob gasps], Squidward, what are you doing?! ,[SpongeBob tries to get Squidward to move, and falls onto the ground trying to do so],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, look. ,[pointing to the Krusty Krab], We're walking in a straight line.
,SpongeBob:, I don't follow.
,Squidward:, A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!
,SpongeBob:, Speak English, brainiac! ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, Well, see, you have point A ,[draws a red A in the sky],, where you start, and then there's point... ,[Squidward draws curved lines in the sky], point...,[erasing everything he wrote], I don't even know what I'm talking about!
,SpongeBob:, ,[the A falls on SpongeBob's tongue], Mmm, strawberry!
,[bubble transition], ,[SpongeBob looks down on his clock],
,SpongeBob's Clock:, Tick!
,SpongeBob:, Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work! ,[running in circles frantically], Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!
,Squidward:, Oh, for the last time ,[drawing the straight line again], straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!
,SpongeBob:, There is always a shortcut!
,Squidward:, What moron told you that?
,Patrick:, ,[walking by], There's always a shortcut!
,Squidward:, ,[Realizing Patrick told SpongeBob that statement],Huh.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob puts on an explorer hat], Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!
,Squidward:, Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!
,[exterior shot of the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs outside],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yoo-hoo!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], You're not going to come with me?
,Squidward:, No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there! ,[laughs], That's the face! That's the look! ,[laughs as Squidward walks to the Krusty Krab], ,[SpongeBob runs off the road to find the ""shortcut""], ,[singing while going through many landmarks], First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut! ,[notices Squidward], Huh?
,Squidward:, Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged! ,[singing again, going through more landmarks], First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut! ,[laughs], There, that's better. ,[SpongeBob notices he's in a darker part of town], ,[laughs nervously], Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost! ,[SpongeBob imagines of what Sandy said to him],
,Sandy:, ,[in a thought bubble], First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!
,[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears],
,SpongeBob:, Local landmarks... ,[SpongeBob looks left and right spotting local landmarks], A-ha! ,[pointing to a large and unusual shell], Right at this large and unusual shell. ,[the creature under the shell emerges and walks away], Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant. ,[SpongeBob spots what appears to be the sign to the Krusty Krab], There it is, the Krusty Krab! ,[SpongeBob climbs over the fence to see it],
,[the scene transitions to the real Krusty Krab, where we see various still images of the inside of the restaurant until we see Squidward relaxing],
,Squidward:, Ahhhh.... ,[Mr. Krabs appears],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, look at this. Lazing about. ,[in a mocking voice], Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?
,Squidward:, No thanks, I got one! ,[Squidward pours himself a mug of cappuccino with an image of his face in it], Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.
,[the scene transitions back to SpongeBob, where SpongeBob finds what he thinks is the Krusty Krab. He comes right up to it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], The Krabby Krust?! ,[SpongeBob notices a guy painting signs], Is that the name of a restaurant?
,Sal:, No, it's a typo.
,SpongeBob:, Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?
,Sal:, Never heard of it.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom! ,[SpongeBob hands the fish coupons], Here, take this coupons!
,Sal:, Thanks! I'm going to go there right now! ,[the fish hands his paintbrush to SpongeBob and drives away in his truck],
,SpongeBob:, I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now? ,[cries], ,[SpongeBob imagines Sandy again, who is hammering a tent to the ground. When Sandy talks to him, SpongeBob stops crying],
,Sandy:, ,[in thought bubble], Remember, your landmarks!
,[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money! ,[SpongeBob goes back the way he came], Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came... ,[running in circles], I'M LOST! ,[screams, until he spots the broken fire hydrant he previously saw], Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant! ,[sits down near the hydrant], Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant! ,[SpongeBob notices many broken fire hydrants], So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out. ,[sees a payphone], Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone. ,[walks to it], Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it. ,[shakes himself upside down; a dime falls out], My last dime. ,[picks up phone], I hope this works. ,[puts dime in coin slot. The cash register phone rings at the Krusty Krab. Squidward groans and answers it],
,Squidward:, Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?
,SpongeBob:, It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone.
,Squidward:, You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?
,SpongeBob:, Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?! ,[beep from the phone],
,Operator:, If you'd like to continue this call, please insert another dime.
,SpongeBob:, I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?
,Operator:, If you'd like to know where you are, please insert another dime.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, hold on! ,[SpongeBob runs to the abandoned sofa, where three tough-looking fish are sitting on it drinking sodas (the main one sitting in the center, Scott, resembles ,Harold,). He digs his hands under the cushions, and finds two nickels], Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!
,Scott:, What are ya doing?
,SpongeBob:, Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!
,Scott:, This is our abandoned sofa, pal!
,[Scott and the fish to the left of him, who resembles ,Scooter,, give off mean looks to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, What ya doing there, drinking soda?
,Scott:, What's it tooya!
,SpongeBob:, Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?
,Scott:, ,[he and the fish to the right of him, who resembles ,Charlie,, give off surprised looks. Scott gets off the sofa and approaches SpongeBob], Hey, listen! I know this gigantic soda isn't good for me, but sometimes it gives me the kick I need to start my busy day as a pedicab driver!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, you drive a pedicab?
,Scott:, Yes, sir! ,[Scott puts on a pedicab driver's hat and grabs his pedicab, which SpongeBob gets into], You need a ride somewhere?
,SpongeBob:, Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it! ,[Scott drives away],
,Scooter:, Way to go, Scott!
,Charlie:, Yeah, he's almost saved enough to attend a community college next year! ,[he and Scooter clench their soda together and continue to drink them],
,[Scott drops SpongeBob off at what appears to be the Krusty Krab again],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets off of the pedicab], Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school! ,[SpongeBob notices the sign], Krusty Klam?! ,[gasps], Wait, Scott, come back! ,[Scott drives away, leaving SpongeBob behind], Tartar sauce! ,[SpongeBob begins frantically running, and checks his clock],
,SpongeBob's Clock:, Tock!
,SpongeBob:, No! Over the cliff! ,[jumps off the cliff into the muck], Through the toxic runoff! ,[runs through a sewer pipe], Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe! ,[SpongeBob slides out of the sewer pipe], Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire! ,[SpongeBob falls down with wires attached to him], Up this massive hill! ,[SpongeBob grows so tired he falls down flat on his face], That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early! ,[SpongeBob crawls his way to the Krusty Krab], ,[SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab],I made it! I made it! ,[SpongeBob hugs two customers], Oh, random Krusty Krab patrients! How I've missed out! ,[SpongeBob jumps onto an old fish's lap and kisses her], Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces! ,[the scene then cuts to outside the bathroom with SpongeBob in it], I missed the bathroom, too! ,[two fish come running out screaming], ,[SpongeBob approaches a fish choking on his Krabby Patty], But most of all, I missed you, choking guy! ,[SpongeBob hugs the choking fish who spits out his chewed-up Krabby Patty, which lands on Patrick's Krabby Patty], ,[SpongeBob notices Patrick], Patrick? How did you get here?

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pushes SpongeBob off of him], Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that! ,[shot of SpongeBob looking like a wreck], You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath! ,[Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob outside],
,SpongeBob:, Aye-aye, sir!
,Squidward:, What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!
,Squidward:, I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin! ,[Squidward runs outside, and gets himself dirty by rolling in dirt, ripping off his shirt, and pouring dirt on his head], Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?! ,[Mr. Krabs sprays Squidward with a hose],
,Mr. Krabs:, There you go! ,[a truck passes by and drives over a puddle, spraying Squidward, who is already laying in the puddle, with more water], Now get to work! ,[Sal exits out of his truck],

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A customer is giving a creepy smile at Squidward.],
,Squidward:, Hmm.
,[The customer makes an even more creepier smile.],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! Where are those patties?
,SpongeBob:, Coming right...down, Squidward. ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, What are you talking about, SpongeBob? Don't you mean coming right up?
,SpongeBob:, Mmm...,[points to the ceiling],
,Squidward:, I don't see what you're— ,[looks up and sees a patty stuck to the ceiling],
,[The patty falls down from the ceiling and lands onto Squidward's eyes, burning them and he screams.],
,SpongeBob:, Nice catch, Squidward! ,[scoops the patty of Squidward's eyes and makes it into a Krabby Patty],
,Squidward:, Thanks...
,[Suddenly, SpongeBob hears a little boy crying in the dining room. He goes out of the kitchen and hands the customer a patty.],
,Customer:, Whoo! ,[chortling and gibbering],
,Little Boy:, I want my teddy fish! ,[sobs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha, ha, all right, don't worry, little boy, we'll find it! ,[to SpongeBob], This kid lost his toy. SpongeBob, I need you to check the Lost and Found.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! I didn't know we had a Lost and Found.
,Little Boy:, I love my teddy fish! ,[sobbing],
,[An angry customer gets up and leaves with her sandwich.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You better find it quick, SpongeBob. The kid's bawlin' is chasing me customers away. Follow me, boy-o!
,Little Boy:, ,[bawling continues],

,Mr. Krabs:, Nice catch!
,[SpongeBob struggles to get up but falls over the ladder.],
,SpongeBob:, Ow!
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, try not to get a bit of anything poisonous!

,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, nothing, nothing. Good luck!
,[SpongeBob sees a box and starts to dig around in it.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, this must be the Lost and Found! ,[looks through the box], It's not in here!

,[SpongeBob turns on the lights and sees a huge collection of lost stuff in the Lost and Found.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Lost umbrellas! Lost flip flops! Lost keys! Lost remotes! Oh! A whole, entire shelf of lost ""cool guy"" shades! Now, that's a sight for more eyes. ,[laughs as dozens of eyes appear in his holes],
,[SpongeBob takes a pair of shades and puts them on.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no pictures, please. Did you get my good side? ,[laughs],
,[A giggle echoes in the background.],
,SpongeBob:, What a funny echo. Ha...ha.
,[Another giggle echoes in the background.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gulps], Hey! ,[laughs], There's bric-a-brac and gee-gaws! ,[gasps], I wonder if there's tchotchkes! Oh! Oh! Tchotchkes! Lost novelty items! Wow! ,[his eye widens and covers his entire face], I love lost novelty items! ,[takes out false teeth], Ooh!
,[The teeth chatters in his arms and shakes SpongeBob, making him step on the whoopee cushions on the floor.],
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me! Oh!
,[The chattering teeth make SpongeBob bounce up and down until he grabs a rubber chicken.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah!
,[SpongeBob performs a Latin dance with the rubber chicken while stepping on the whoopee cushions. He throws the rubber chicken away.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams and hides in his pants as a real chicken flies over him],
,[SpongeBob finishes his Latin dance and cymbal-clapping sea monkeys clap their cymbals.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, thank you, cymbal-clapping sea chimps! ,[notices a snow globe], What is this? Looks like Bikini Bottom.
,[SpongeBob shakes the snow globe. Suddenly, the entire place rumbles and the people in Bikini Bottom scream as if they are having an earthquake. The shaking stops and SpongeBob nervously puts the snow globe down.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew! ,[gets hit by a falling box], Whoa!
,[Another giggle echoes in the background. Meanwhile, upstairs in the kitchen, Mr. Krabs waits just as Squidward walks in.],
,Squidward:, Hey, Mr. Krabs, you know that crying kids?
,[The little boy continues his crying.],
,Squidward:, He's still crying...and it's still annoying!
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, I'm glad you're here. I think SpongeBob may be lost in the Lost and Found.
,Squidward:, And this concerns me how, exactly? ,[gets grabbed by Mr. Krabs], Wait—what?! ,[screams as he is thrown into the Lost and Found],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry. There's a ladder.
,[The little boy's constant crying begins to drive all of the customers crazy.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And find that toy...pronto!
,[Meanwhile in the Lost and Found, SpongeBob wakes up and sees four elderly kids hovering over him.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Are you the people of the too-small clothes?
,Ginger:, No. We were the children, lost in the Krusty Krab over 60 years ago, and we were never claimed.
,SpongeBob:, Did you drop a box on my head?
,Ginger:, Of course! It's how we say hello.
,SpongeBob:, Oh! ,[throws a box on one of the older kids], Hello!
,Old Kid #1:, ,[weakly], Hello. ,[moans as he drags away],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no...looks like I'm lost now too.
,Ginger:, Don't worry. You are found and can live with us now.
,SpongeBob:, How did you survive down here all this time?
,Ginger:, People leave all kinds of things behind. Like gum. And mints. They leave lots of mints. ,[eats a mint and belches out a horrible breath, which makes SpongeBob dizzy],
,SpongeBob:, Your breath is delightfully fresh.
,Ginger:, ,[claps twice], Bring on the welcoming feast!
,[The three older kids runs away and come back with a table filled with stuff made out of candy.],
,Old Kids:, Welcoming feast!
,[The candies are shaped like a turkey, a suckling pig, a bottle of wine, and a  cornucopia with fruit.],
,Ginger:, Dig in!
,[The older kids eat the candied-shaped food. Some of them blew bubbles with the bubble gum while others stuff candy in each others mouth. Ginger goes to give candy to a teddy bear with fins on each side.],
,Ginger:, Hey, little dolly. You must be getting hungry! ,[she squeaks the toy],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey! That's the teddy fish! My boss, Mr. Krabs, told me to grab that. Thank you!
,Ginger:, Grr! This? I found it, so...finders keepers.
,Old Kids:, Finders keepers. Finders keepers.
,[SpongeBob taps Ginger's shoulder.],
,Ginger:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs the toy], Yoink! Losers weepers! ,[runs away],
,Old Kid #2:, He is using our sacred words against us!
,Ginger:, That's my teddy fish! Get him!
,[The four older kids chase after SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, but this has to go back to its rightful owner!
,[SpongeBob continues to run. The four older kids try to catch up, but because they are old, they walk slowly gasping and wheezing.],
,Old Kid #2:, Run...like the wind...
,[Meanwhile, Squidward is going around the Lost and Found, looking for SpongeBob.],
,Squidward:, Moron! I mean, SpongeBoooob?! I can't believe Old Man Krabs has held on to all this stuff. ,[notices a box of kazoos], Oooh! Kazoos! Why, I had a kazoo when I was a child...
,[A flashback of a younger Squidward is shown.],
,Squidward:, Everybody loved it!
,[Little Squidward blows threw the kazoo, making music that is off-key. All of the children run out of the school, screaming.],
,School Kid:, Oh! Ow! My ears! ,[sobbing],
,[The flashback ends. Squidward looks through a box and sees clarinets in it.],
,Squidward:, These are clarinets! In fact, these are all my clarinets! Wait a minute—these weren't lost! They were all in my locker! Mmm.. ,[hears SpongeBob's panting], Now what could that possibly—,[gets run over by SpongeBob],
,[In slow motion, SpongeBob steps onto Squidward's old clarinets and breaks them as his runs.],
,Squidward:, ,[groans and sees the broken clarinets], Typical.
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs looking through the Lost and Found door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward? SpongeBob? It's the curse of the Lost and Found: no one ever gets found. They just stay lost. ,[closes the door], Oh, well, back to work.
,Little Boy:, Waaah!
,Customer:, The ambiance in this place stinks! ,[leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Stinky ambiance? Oooh, it's a dark time for the Krusty Krab.
,Little Boy:, Waaaah!
,Mr. Krabs:, Waaaaah!
,[SpongeBob continues to run away from the older kids.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Lost toys! ,[almost gets hit by a toy arrow and screams, then he pants as he jumps on a scooter],
,[The older kids ride on tricycles and skateboards as they chase SpongeBob.],
,Ginger:, Get him!

,SpongeBob:, Lost Toilets? ,[hops on a toilet and rides off],
,[The older kids ride on toilets as they chase SpongeBob.],
,Ginger:, We need more speed!
,[The older kids flush the toilets to go faster. SpongeBob manages to slow them down by getting them tangled with toile paper, causing them to crash into each other.],
,SpongeBob:, Lost Pets! ,[gasps and whimpers],
,[SpongeBob continues to run as the older kids chase him on snails.],
,Older Kid #2:, Hyah! Hyah! Mush! Mush!
,[SpongeBob and the older kids ride through a mine as miners dig up jewelry.],
,SpongeBob:, Lost Mine!
,[The older kids throw diamonds at SpongeBob, but he deflects them back with his spongy body. Then, SpongeBob is seen riding on a Tylosaurus  in the prehistoric lost world.],
,SpongeBob:, Lost world!
,[The older kids ride on the back of a Tanystropheus as they chase SpongeBob. The scene changes to Squidward continuing to look for SpongeBob. However, he looks up and sees a hatch on the ceiling.],
,Squidward:, A hatch! Maybe that's the emergency exit! ,[opens it and grease rains down on him], Grease trap!?
,[Squidward gets caught in the torrent of grease and screams helplessly. SpongeBob is still being chased by the older kids until he reaches a dead end.],
,SpongeBob:, Lost dead ends?! ,[mutters and whimpers],
,[The older kids corner SpongeBob.],
,Ginger:, Give us the teddy fish!
,Old Kids:, Teddy fish! Teddy fish!
,SpongeBob:, No! This teddy fish belongs to a poor, sweet child! ,[notices grease on the floor], Huh? ,[licks the grease], Patty grease? Oh, no! I haven't cleaned the grease trap in years!
,Old Kids:, Oh, no.
,Ginger:, Quick! Get on each other's shoulders.
,[The older kids make a ladder as they climb on their shoulders.],
,Ginger:, ,[climbs on them], At least some of us will survive.
,Old Kid #1:, Aw, come on!
,SpongeBob:, Wait! I have a better idea! ,[whistles],
,[Upstairs, Mr. Krabs and the little boy continue to wail.],
,Mr. Krabs:, No SpongeBob, no teddy fish, no customers! ,[sobbing], All is lost!
,[A knock is heard on the door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffles], Who is it?
,SpongeBob:, Tylo!
,Mr. Krabs:, Tylo who? ,[gasps as SpongeBob opens the door with a Tylosaurus],
,SpongeBob:, Tylosaurus!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! Thank Neptune you're back, son!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, good to be back Mr. Krabs, but I'm not the only one. Look who I found!
,[Ginger comes up the door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ack! ,[hits Ginger with SpongeBob], Get back! Get back!
,Ginger's mother:, Ginger? Is that you?
,Ginger:, Mom? What are you doing here?
,Ginger's mother:, We come here every week.
,Ginger:, ""We?""
,Ginger's mother:, Yes. Myself and your father and the other parents of kids who were lost here. Where were you?
,Ginger:, In the Lost and Found!
,Ginger's mother:, ,[stutter], There's a Lost and Found?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hm. Maybe I should put up a sign.
,[Ginger and the older kids hug their older parents as they are happily reunited.],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, all the old people are hugging.
,[Mr. Krabs pats SpongeBob for doing a good job of reuniting the families.],
,SpongeBob:, Dry your tears, little kid. Look! It's teddy fish! ,[gives the kid his toy],
,Little Boy:, I don't want that anymore!
,[The little boy throws the teddy fish. Ginger catches the toy.],
,Ginger:, Huh? ,[hugs the toy], Hmm.
,Little Boy:, I want this! ,[rides on the Tylosaurus], Whaaa-hoo!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I guess we all learned a lesson about being lost and being found today.
,SpongeBob:, What's that, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, speaking of lost, where's Squidward?
,[Squidward, who is still in the Lost and Found, screams as he is being swept away in a river of the lost world. He blows the kazoo and continues to scream and even bawl uncontrollably as the Tylosaurus and Tanystropheus swim and stomp over him respectively.],

"Squidward:, ,[At register], Ah, yes, just how I like it... nice and empty., [looks around at the empty restaurant],
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[Sitting at a table], Hey, I'm still here. ,[Waves],
,Squidward:, Oh, yes, sirree—nice and empty. ,[Looks around then sits down at the register. Presses a button revealing a slot with a pillow. Pulls down a picture of an island and turns on a fan. Drinks a drink and is relaxed],
,Jimmy:, Do you work here? ,[looking over register],
,Squidward:, ,[Spits his drink. Sighs], Welcome to the Krusty-- Wha-What the! ,[Sees the large line of people and gasps], Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! Sponge... Bob! SpongeBob! Where are you! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties. ,[Looking for SpongeBob in the kitchen. SpongeBob starts laughing from inside a barrel. Squidward looks through the barrel hole. SpongeBob is writing in a book. Squidward grumbles and sticks a megaphone into the hole], SPONGEBOB! ,[SpongeBob comes out of the megaphone like liquid], Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers. ,[Customers making monkey noises, chewing on things, and swinging from ropes],
,SpongeBob:, ,[In liquid form, goes to the storage freezer and comes back out with a stack of patties], I got it. ,[Spins like a tornado throwing the patties onto the grill. Presses button on spatula twice that makes it fold out to have triple length. Flips three patties and whistles],

I need a hairpin. ,[Mr. Krabs is in his office writing on paper. Squidward reaches behind him and pulls out a hairpin. Mr. Krabs' hair puffs out into an afro.

,SpongeBob:, ""Dear diary, what an amazing day I've..."" ,[Fades into SpongeBob narrating he story], ...day I've had. ,[Phone ringing], This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward. ,[Answers phone], He had some very important news he was just bursting to share. ,[Phone growls at SpongeBob. Walks to Squidward's house], He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet. ,[Knocks on the door. Squidward answers and holds Gary angrily. Gary is chewing. Squidward shoves Gary to SpongeBob], Specifically, what not to feed them. ,[Squidward holds up a record album that reads ""Sole Jazz"" and throws it at SpongeBob], The list was very thorough. ,[Squidward holds up a torn shirt on hanger, then a picture of his mother with a bite taken out of it], Needless to say, this is all very enlightening. ,[Squidward throws picture on ground and jumps on it], It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique-- ,[Squidward yelling in SpongeBob's face], Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are. '[Squidward points and pokes SpongeBob angrily], Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short. ,[Gary bites Squidward's hand. Squidward punts SpongeBob], And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year, ,[SpongeBob lands at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs unlocks the front door], cleaning day! ,[SpongeBob mopping, Mr. Krabs reading the paper], Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab, ,[SpongeBob scrubbing floor], and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots. ,[Mr. Krabs using SpongeBob as chimney sweep], Ah yes, cleaning day. ,[Narration ends]
,Squidward:, Great Neptune, I had no idea. The depth of his delusion is awe inspiring.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Knocks on door], Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right. ,[SpongeBob is at a dumpster. Gasps], Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward. He can be so gullible. ,[SpongeBob sets the delivery in the dumpster],
,Patrick:, ,[Comes up from inside the dumpster], Oh, boy! ,[Looks in bag], A ketchup packet! That'll go great on this old diaper. ,[Holds up ketchup and diaper],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Back at the Krusty Krab. Chuckles], Oh, Squidward! You are gonna laugh when you hear what I've... been. ,[Squidward crouches down to hide], Squidward? Where are you? Could have sworn I just saw him.

,SpongeBob:, ,[Takes hanger and plunger], Duty calls.
,[Squidward takes diary out from inside his hat. Opens it, turns the page, and laughs. His laugh turns into a cough as he sees a large customer at the register],
,Customer #2:, You laughing at me?
,Squidward:, What? Oh, no. No, no, no. I was just reading what SpongeBob wrote in his diary. It's hilarious.
,Customer #2:, Reading somebody else's diary—that's terrible! Tell me more!
,Squidward:, It says here, when SpongeBob see plaid, he has the uncontrollable urge to cluck like a chicken. ,[Both laugh],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Now at the register], Did somebody say plaid? Why I'm a plaid enthusiast. ,[Wearing kilt], I just got me new kilt today.
,Squidward:, Oh, SpongeBob. Can you come here, please?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Walks out of the restroom with  a tire, umbrella, guitar, anchor, and Old Man Jenkins], I couldn't find that watch anywhere. All I found was this stuff--

,Henry-Bart:, He named his spatula ""Fifi.""
,Nat:, He named his spatula ""Fifi."" ,[Telling customers behind him. Customers laugh], What kind of name is Fifi?

,Nat:, That was that little dude's diary? ,[Door slams],
,Customers:, ,[Overlapping murmuring], That is not okay. That was uncool.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's low, Squidward... even for you. You'd better apologize.

,Squidward:, Oh, boy, let me see one of those papers. Uh-huh, mm-hm. ,[Cover of paper shows a sad photo of SpongeBob. Squidward laughs and tosses the paper on the ground. Citizens stare at him], Taxi! ,[Waving, a taxi car with the model of the boat screeches its tires, approaching him],
,Driver:, Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it, pal. You're that diary reader.
,Squidward:, Yes, I am. ,[Driving away in an angry attitude after hearing tires squeal, Squidward coughs in the exhaust. Then he continues walking],

,Squidward:, ,[coughs], What?
,Quincy:, Take it away, boys! ,[Squidward’s house is lifted away with a crane. Thunder crashes and it starts to rain. Squidward puts up his umbrella and gets hit by lightning],

,[Squidward is locked in a pillory],
,Patrick:, Diary reader! ,[He throws a tomato at Squidward],
,Squidward:, What!? You read it, too!

,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward. How's it going?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, oh, thank goodness. You have to forgive me.
,SpongeBob:, What for?
,Squidward:, For reading your diary.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you. ,[Holds up book titled ""SpongeBob's Diary""], Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary. ,[Holds up a diary titled ""My Secret Personal Diary"" with a unicorn, smiley face, heart, and rainbow on the cover], Now, that would have been really embarrassing.
,Nat:, There he is! That diary reader! ,[Group of fish holding tomatoes show up], Let's get him!
,Crowd:, Yeah! ,[Shouting angrily at Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward.
,Nat:, Oh yeah, did you know he's reading your personal diary? ,[Squidward laughs while holding reading the diary],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! How could you?! 
,[SpongeBob bursts into tears, then runs away once again. After SpongeBob runs away, the crowd throws tomatoes at Squidward yelling at him],

,Man Ray:, The delicious new treat no mortal can resist?
,[The image changes to show Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy heading down the Conveyor belt],

,Man Ray:, ,[Walks onscreen], Ooh, I just love the little pip-squeak patty, ,[He lifts up the box], small fries, and cold juice product.
,Narrator:, Of course you do, Man Ray. ,[The scene changes back to the whirlpool beginning where ""KK"" can be read. It then goes away and shows the Krabby Kids Meal Box, fries in a container that reads ""KK,"" the Krabby Patty, and a juice box that reads ""100% Juice""], ,[Off-Screen Children saying ""Yay""], Everyone loves the new Krusty Kids Meal. ,[The scene pans out and shows a Mermaid Man Action figure. the background light is turned off to show the toy in the spotlight.], And for a limited time, ,[Off-Screen Someone says ""ooh""], get your free toy inside.

,[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Man Ray laugh as the words ""Only at the Krusty Krab"" appear on screen] [The scene changes to show Plankton at the Chum Bucket watching the commercial on the TV setting of Karen],
,Plankton:, Krabs calls that a commercial? Who'd fall for that schlock? ,[He walks to over to where his periscope is and pulls it down], Say...,[The scene changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab full of fish], Something is going on over there. 
,[The scene pans in to the interior of the Krusty Krab where a bunch of kids are having fun and playing in the Krusty Krab while watching Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on a big screen] [The image changes to Squidward in a superhero-like costume holding a plate with 6 Kids Meals.],
,Squidward:, The Krusty Krab welcomes... ,[reads the card in his hand], the Tarpon twins' birthday party. Here are your Krabby Kids Meals. ,[all the kids dive in and take Squidward with them],
,Plankton:, ,[The scene returns to the Chum Bucket and Plankton still looking through his periscope], Never trust kids, Squidward. Never trust kids.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[The scene goes back to the Krusty Krab where it shows SpongeBob in a Superhero-like costume (not his Mermaid Man Costume) at the register and Mr. Krabs holding a bag of Money], Gotta hand it to ya, boy. ,[The image changes to just show Mr. Krabs with the money], Gettin' Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to shoot for me restaurant was a stroke of genius.

,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but it's ,so, worth it when you get to work in these. ,[shows his uniform which consists of red underwear and a disguise mask around his eyes, and you hear a five-note poorly played trumpet fanfare],
,Plankton:, ,[The scene returns to the Chum Bucket and Plankton still looking through his periscope], Stupid kid. Wait a minute, what's this? ,[The scene returns to the Krusty Krab where it shows Karen and Mr. Krabs talking and laughing (Plankton's voice is blocking what they say)], Karen? ,[The image changes to show (through the Krusty Krab window) the exterior of the Chum Bucket with Plankton's Periscope, which shows his eye], My own wife?! ,[The scene changes to show Plankton inside the chum bucket; the door is also shown], Oh, how Krabs mocks me. ,[He pushes his periscope back up],
,Karen:, ,[opens doors to Chum Bucket], Hi, honey.
,Plankton:, ,[He turns around], What's that? A souvenir from your boyfriend Krabs?
,Karen:, ,[The image changes to show Karen's face], Oh, pipe down. I just went to get you this ,[The image changes to show [Plankton looking mad and Karen's hand putting down the Kids Meal box], happy hero box.
,Plankton:, Wha...?! ,[jumps on top of the box], Thanks, babe. You're too good to me. ,[opens the box and gasps], A Mermaid Man action figure...And a Barnacle Boy eraser?! ,[Jumps down and plays with the toys], Look at me. I'm Barnacle Boy. Look at me. I'm Mermaid Man. ,[The scene pans out to show Mr. Krabs on the box], Krabs! ,[hits the side of the box with Krabs' picture on it with his new toys while laughing. He jumps on top of the box and continues to laugh. He jumps off of it. The crushed box is shown.], Sure! Why didn't I think of this before? If Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy can build Krabs up, they can tear him down, too. ,[maniacal laughter. The scene changes to show the exterior of Shady Shoals Rest Home. Snoring can be heard. The scene changes to show the bottom of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's room door. The snoring continues], Ding dong. ,[door opens. Plankton is wearing a plaid, yellow shirt, a red bow tie, and a boater hat with a yellow stripe], Hello, boys. ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are the ones snoring, they wake up],
,Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy:, What? What? What?
,Plankton:, I'm Down Here, Fellas!
,Mermaid Man:, Who are you?
,Plankton:, ,[Hops onto Mermaid Man's foot], Oh, Professor Plankton, Door-to-door salesman. ,[gets out a card], My card.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[takes card and reads it], ""Professor Plankton's Personal Products?""
,Plankton:, ,Say,, you two look like a couple of ladies' men, am I right? ,[An ugly image of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy is seen. A scream and glass breaking can be heard.], I knew it! Just look at that heroic chin. ,[Barnacle Boy's chin has zits and bumps in it and you hear a horse neigh], Those chiseled features. ,[Mermaid Man's ears has hair growing out of it and zits all over and you hear a monkey scream], That bra. ,[An elephant is heard. He then jumps to his neck.], But what's this? Dandruff?
,Mermaid Man:, I've got dandruff?
,Plankton:, You sure do. ,[pours laundry soap around his neck], See?
,Mermaid Man:, Oh, my! ,[looks at soap],
,Plankton:, ,[He goes over to Barnacle Boy's head and lifts up Barnacle Boy's hat but sees there is real dandruff under there. The scene zooms in and shows the dandruff in more detail and snow bells jingling is heard], Ew! ,[He then moves back to Mermaid Man's foot], Couple of studs like you can't go around like this. Lucky for you, Dr. Plankton's come prepared with ""Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo"". A little of this stuff and the ladies will be breakin' down your door.
,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:, ,[Barnacle Boy pulls a lever which moves their couch back until it is flat], Sign us up, Professor.
,Plankton:, ,[He moves to the now-flat back of the couch between both Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy], Wise decision, gentlemen. ,[rubs the shampoo into both of their scalps while humming happily], Hey, what do we have here? You fellas look a little peaked. ,[both are now under Plankton's control], Hmm, this shouldn't be. I wonder. ,[tears off the dandruff tag a little on the shampoo bottle], Say, this isn't Professor Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo! It's Professor Plankton's ,[Pulls of the rest of the tag], Mind Control Shampoo! ,[laughs], With conditioner. Time to prepare for your next role, fellas, as my zombies! ,[laughs. The scene changes, through a card that says ""Wipe!"", to the Krusty Krab where there is a gigantic line outside and giant Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy balloons above the building],
,Kids:, ,[chanting], We want Mermaid Man! We want Barnacle Boy! ,[kids throw Squidward into the window, which solidly flattens and Squidward slides away. The kids chant some more while throwing stuff around], We want Mermaid Man! We want Barnacle Boy! We want Mermaid Man!...
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, hey, kids? ,[The kids stop chanting], Uh, well, there's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the ballroom. ,[all the kids run inside the ballroom and Mr. Krabs closes the door behind them to keep them inside], SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[He jogs over], Yes, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Go get those AWOL do-gooders you talked me into hirin', and bring their patoots back here on the double!
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. ,[He runs off-screen],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Grabs a broom], Back, you! Back! 
,[the broom he was using to keep the kids back is eaten. The scene changes to Shady Shoals Rest Home where all of the fish are either running away or hiding in fear of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's destruction of the place. SpongeBob enters the building],
,SpongeBob:, ,[He goes over to the receptionist], Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, please. And I'm kind of in a hurry. ,[The receptionist shrieks and ducks as a chair is thrown and breaks above him. While waiting, SpongeBob whistle-sings a song], Doot, do, doot-do, doot... ,[Mermaid Man taps him on the shoulder. SpongeBob gasps then shrieks. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy growl at him while under Plankton's control], Oh, my gosh. You guys live in a dump! But we don't have time for that right now. We gotta get you back to the Krusty Krab for your special appearance. I'll take ya. ,[Mermaid Man takes SpongeBob's hand and does the Spine Blaster on him while he grunts.], Wow! I haven't seen you do the Spine Blaster since... ,[Mermaid Man does Spine Blaster on SpongeBob again and he again grunts.], ...since episode 647. ,[Mermaid Man does the Spine Blaster on SpongeBob once again and he still grunts], When you blasted that guy's spine. ,[He whimpers while getting up], You still got it. ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drag SpongeBob off. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab],
,Perch Perkins:, Perch Perkins here, live at the Krusty Krab. We're just moments away from an important press conference with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have with me here Eugene Krabs, owner of the restaurant. Any thoughts, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[muttering gibberish because of all the money in his pocket],
,Perch:, ,[chuckles], Oh, okay. We'll come back to you later. ,[SpongeBob comes crashing down through the ceiling],
,SpongeBob:, Ladies and gentlemen, I present Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy crash through the side of the Krusty Krab. All the kids break through the ballroom cage and run up to their heroes cheering. But Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy throw them aside and go up to the press conference booths while the cameras flash. They growl.],
,Plankton:, ,[hiding in Mermaid Man's right ear], Oh, boy! Everyone in Bikini Bottom showed up! This is gonna be so sweet. ,[maniacal laughter],
,Perch:, Mermaid Man, ,[Clearly and slower than normal.], what is your opinion of the Krabby Patty?
,Plankton:, Ooh! This is too easy. Now just tell everyone that... ,[whispers into his ear],
,Mermaid Man:, I, Mermaid Man, think that Krabby Patties are, uh... uh, what?
,Plankton:, They're terrible! You hate Krabby Patties.
,Mermaid Man:, I'm late for ""Snappy Pabbies?"" Barnacle Boy, ,[He Slaps him which makes him come out of the trance],  we're late for... ,[snores],
,Plankton:, Oh, for crying out loud! ,[walks up to his ear drum], Tell them you hate Krabby Patties! ,[Mermaid Man snores then exhales. Plankton gets frustrated and goes through the ear canal],
,Mermaid Man:, Wha?...
,SpongeBob:, ,[Off-Screen], Mermaid Man. ,[now on-screen, whispering], I brought you something to refresh your memory. ,[He pulls out a Krabby Patty],
,Mermaid Man:, ,[Off-Screen], Ooh, a Krabby Patty! ,[now on-screen, he takes the Krabby Patty from SpongeBob.], Would you look at that? ,[He moves back to Barnacle Boy], Barnacle Boy, it's a Krabby Patty. Why, these things are... ,[becomes under the mind control again], ...evil! 
,[everyone gasps. SpongeBob Screams],
,Frank:, Susie, no! ,[slaps her patty away],
,[Barnacle Boy is also somehow now under the mind control],
,Mermaid Man:, I hate these nasty things, ,[spits on it, SpongeBob becomes broken and cracks into pieces],. And furthermore...
,Plankton:, ,[talks through a microphone inside Mermaid Man], ...let it be known that I, Mermaid Man prefer the delicious food available at the Chum Bucket.
,Mermaid Man:, Your new favorite restaurant!
,[The Crowd gasps],
,SpongeBob:, The Chum Bucket?!! Plankton must be behind this.
,Plankton:, Yes. Yes! ,[He is shown in the pupil of Mermaid Man],  It's working. ,[Laughs. The crowd is mumbling disgustedly and exit the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Hold it right there! You forgot your...Krabby Patties!
,Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy:, ,[They get out of the mind control and drool], Krabby Patties. Krabby Patties!
,Plankton:, Oh, no. Those infernal Krabby Patties. Their grease-fried deliciousness could be enough to free Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ,[Plankton turns a switch to slap Mermaid Man from eating a Krabby Patty. They return back to being under the mind control. Plankton makes Mermaid Man throw one away and then stomp on the one that Barnacle Boy had. Then they walk out and walk past SpongeBob, knocking him over. They are stopped by SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Not so fast! You're not dealing with an ordinary fry cook! It's time for you to meet... ,[throws an exploding capsule on the ground], Fry Boy, Defender of... Ow! ,[notices his that his outfit hasn't changed, so, he uses another exploding capsule to put on another outfit], Fry Boy... ,[ He is now wearing a superhero costume that  features two Krabby Patties, two Spatulas, and a cape. His voice becomes deep and he has a large chin.], ...Defender of the Krabby Patty! ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy growl and run after SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws the patties up into the air and hits them with his spatulas sending them to Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy but the heroes duck. SpongeBob jumps. The heroes continue to  run. SpongeBob stretches his arms around some coral and sends the heroes back towards him. He trips them into the ground and eating a Krabby Patty], Yes! You lose, Plankton! Now watch as the Krabby Patties' wholesome flavors work their magic! ,[nothing happens so Plankton sends the heroes over to the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, I did it! I did it! Look at all these customers. ,[evil laugh], In your face, Krabs. Yes!
,Harold:, So, uh, where's the food?
,Plankton:, ,[laughs evil. Gasps], Food? Oh, yeah. Never thought I'd get this far. ,[goes into the kitchen],
,[The Scene changes to show SpongeBob still stomped in the ground],
,SpongeBob:, It doesn't make sense. ,[He pops his head out], They should have been cured once the pureness of the Krabby Patties entered their... That's it! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are elderly. ,[Scene changes to inside Mermaid Man's stomach], Their poor aging tummies must be having a hard time digesting the food. ,[Scene changes back to SpongeBob], I know just what to do! ,[He exits the hole and runs to the Away. He crashes through the Chum Bucket's wall with a ""fiber"" truck and pours fiber into the heroes mouths. Their stomachs digest the food and they go return to their normal selves.],
,Mermaid Man:, I'm back to my old self again! Thanks to you, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, And the delicious power of Krabby Patties. ,[He looks at the ""camera"" almost like it is a commercial.],
,Mermaid Man:, Say, I could use a couple more of those, and an order of Krabby Fries.
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[walks out of the bathroom], And a decent latrine.
,SpongeBob:, Well, then, you guys know where to go!
,SpongeBob, Mermaid Man, & Barnacle Boy:, To the Krusty Krab! Away! ,[everyone goes over to the Krusty Krab],
,Plankton:, Hey, everyone, I made Chummy Joes!, [Plankton screams as he sees everyone at the Krusty Krab],

,SpongeBob:, ,[pulling out a long list from his pocket], We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon.
,Patrick:, Let's do this!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, how are we on snacks?
,Patrick:, Oh, hmm... I don't know. We might be able to pull through... ,[gestures to a wall stacked with ridiculous amounts of junk food], the first hour.
,SpongeBob:, Check. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures? ,[grunts, forcing six different action figures out of his craters], Check. Drapes?
,Patrick:, Check. ,[entering from behind purple drapes with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on them],
,SpongeBob:, Lampshade?
,Patrick:, Check. ,[turns on Mermaid Man lamp he's wearing around his neck],

,Johnny:, For sixty-some-odd years, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have quadruple-handedly kept the sea crime-free. ,[The two heroes pop the Dirty Bubble, releasing the citizen], And in celebration of such longevity, we're kicking off this weekend-long hero fest with the never-before-aired Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Special! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick's skin peels in excitement], And now, without further fanfare, ,[fanfare plays], the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Spe-,[TV turns off unexpectedly],
,SpongeBob:, No... ,[crashing sound, lights go off and windows are shattered], NO! ,[SpongeBob's house is ripped apart and thrown into the air, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick sitting there], No! This is terrible! How will we see the Origin Special now? ,[TV is blown by wind and is pulverized against the side of Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick run to Squidward’s house and pound on his front door],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! Squidward! Let us in! We're missing the Mermaid Man marathon!
,Squidward:, Go away! I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits. ,[Squidward's TV shows a man in a leotard performing ballet; the TV unexpectedly turns off], ...what? Circuit must've blown again. ,[opens door, letting the wind ruin his living room. SpongeBob and Patrick are also swept inside],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward.
,Patrick:, Yeah, we owe you one! ,[Squidward's house is also ripped apart by the wind and is hurled into the air], What now, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Patrick. All the TVs in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind. ,[thinking], Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Thanks for nothing, Squidward. ,[he follows SpongeBob, who is leaving],
,Squidward:, So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans! ,[He screams as he is flung into the air],
,SpongeBob:, ,[both are grunting because they are crawling], We made it! ,[sees a welcome mat in front of the Mermalair secret entrance], Patrick, get up! We have found the Mermalair! ,[they proceed, but plunge into a trapdoor underneath the mat. They plunge into a net and drop onto the ground],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[exchanging glances], Again!
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[spotting the two on the ground], Oh, boy.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[laughing as they are dragged by Mermaid Man to they main control panel of the Mermalair], Again!
,Barnacle Boy:, Do you mind telling us what you're doing here?
,Patrick:, We wanna watch your TV!
,Barnacle Boy:, I hate to break it to you kids, but you'll have to go somewhere else. Our power got knocked out in the storm.
,Patrick:, But, but... now how will we ever learn about their secret ""gorinin""? ,[he mispronounces ""origin""],
,SpongeBob:, Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!
,Patrick:, ...Yeah, so?
,SpongeBob:, So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?
,Patrick:, Whoa! You're like a brain professor!
,SpongeBob:, Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started.
,Mermaid Man:, You wanna go back to the start of it all, eh? Well, you see, in the beginning, it was all dark. And then all of a sudden, an event called The Big Splash formed the seas, and-
,Barnacle Boy:, Not the beginning of time, Mermaid-Brain. They want to know how we became a crime-fighting duo.
,Mermaid Man:, Oh... right. ,[thinking], Well, it all started when I was just a young, handsome muscular lad, ,[A flashback begins, showing a young, handsome Mermaid Man surfing and eating a submarine sandwich], when suddenly, I noticed that my washing machine had stopped. ,[Mermaid Man of the flashback grabs the clothes out of the washing machine on the beach],
,Barnacle Boy:, What are you talking about? ,[flashback ends],
,Mermaid Man:, Huh?
,Barnacle Boy:, You're supposed to be telling the story of how we became superheroes!
,Mermaid Man:, ,[facepalms], ...The story. Yes. I was a young, handsome muscular lad, soaking up the sun's rays on the beach, ,[a new flashback begins, very similar to the first one], when suddenly, I became drowsy. ,[Mermaid Man in the flashback falls asleep instantly], A wave came ashore, and drew me back into the ocean! ,[waves draw Mermaid Man in the flashback into the sea, he is drowning, and he yells ""Help!"" while coughing], Suddenly, I realized I was being sucked under by a violent whirlpool! I was running out of oxygen fast. ,[Mermaid Man in the flashback sinks to the bottom of the sea and gives up trying the struggle], But before I drowned, I was rescued by mermaids. ,[Mermaid Man in the flashback is carried through the ocean by two mermaids], They took me to the ocean floor, where they gave me a magic sea star that allowed me to breathe underwater. ,[Mermaid Man in the flashback inhales and exhales deeply, then falls asleep, the present Mermaid Man falls asleep also],
,Barnacle Boy:, Wake up, you old coot. Finish the story.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[wakes up after being nudged by Barnacle Boy], Huh?
,SpongeBob:, ,[excitedly], Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?
,Patrick:, Yeah, how'd you two meet?
,Mermaid Man:, ,[slapping his temples], Oh, sorry, boys... There I was in the ocean, the only human who could breathe underwater. ,[flashback resumes], Alas, such a life got lonely real fast; I had no other humans to talk to. What was a man to do? Then my question was answered. ,[the bottom of a boat is seen in the flashback, then the port side of the boat is shown, where a very young Barnacle Boy is scraping barnacles off the wood. The captain of the boat appears],
,Captain:, Hey, barnacle boy, make sure you scrape the barnacles underneath, too.
,Young Barnacle Boy:, Aye, aye. ,[he takes a deep breath and lowers himself underwater to get the barnacles under the surface],
,Flashback Mermaid Man:, A boy in trouble! I've got to act fast or he'll drown. ,[he swims to Barnacle Boy], Fear not, young man. I'll take care of this.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[narrating once again], I used my new telekinetic powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's body, where they took the place of his lungs so he could breathe underwater, too. It was at that moment when we decided to team up.
,SpongeBob:, ,[the flashback has ended], Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together.
,Barnacle Boy:, No, no, no... ,[shaking head and crossing arms], The reason I teamed up with this joker is because I was stuck breathing underwater for the rest of my life.
,Mermaid Man:, Oh... yeah.
,Barnacle Boy:, Anyway, from that day forward, we became
,Johnny:, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, superhero crime fighters!
,Flashback Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:, ,[new flashback begins, an alarm is clanging while people are shouting], A crime in progress! ,[A bank robber laughs maniacally as he is stealing bags of cash from the First Nautical Bank],
,Banker:, Stop! Thief!
,Flashback Barnacle Boy:, See if you think this is funny, evildoer. ,[He rapidly spits barnacles at the robber, knocking him down], Who's laughing now, thieving scum?
,Banker:, ,[shaking Mermaid Man's hand], Thank you, sir. And to whom do I owe this debt of gratitude?
,Flashback Mermaid Man:, You can thank me, Mermaid Man. ,[Barnacle Boy is seen shaking in indignity in the background],
,Man Ray:, ,[new flashback begins, Man Ray has the upper hand in a duel against Barnacle Boy. He laughs], You're mine!
,Flashback Barnacle Boy:, ,[shoots web a web of cheese-like material that binds and gags Man Ray], How'd you like to taste my tentacle zapper, Man Ray?
,Flashback Mermaid Man:, ,[dialing a pay phone], Hello... ,[indistinct response], So? What are you wearing? ,[indistinct response], Oh. In that case, can I get a large pepperoni pizza, extra cheese? Thanks. ,[Barnacle Boy slaps his head in disgust],
,Mermaid Man:, ,[flashback has ended], That didn't happen!
,Barnacle Boy:, Oh, yes, it did!
,Mermaid Man:, Oh no, it didn't!
,Barnacle Boy:, Oh, ha ha, like you remember. You don't even remember where you live.
,Mermaid Man:, It didn't happen!
,Johnny:, ,[the Mermalair's large TV suddenly turns on], And now, without any further delays, the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Episode.
,SpongeBob:, ,[standing up excitedly], Oh, this is it!
,Johnny:, The story of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy all started here. ,[The TV zooms in on a series of red apartment buildings],
,Tim:, ,[Barnacle Boy is now a young adult dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans, in front of the television sitting on a couch], Come on, Ernie! The movie's about to start... Where's the popcorn?
,Ernie:, ,[Mermaid Man is now a young adult dressed in a striped shirt and khakis. He is waiting next to the microwave in the kitchen], It's in the microwave, Tim.
,Johnny:, ,[talking very rapidly as the scene he is describing unfolds as he is talking], At that very moment in the apartment directly above, a rogue scientist doing tests on radioactive ants knocks over a jar of his infected specimens, one of which, without any hesitation, crawls down one floor and miraculously lands undetected. It viciously bites our soon-to-be superhero. He screams in pain,...
,Ernie:, Ahh!
,Johnny:, ...stumbling backwards.
,Tim:, What on earth?
,Johnny:, In a split-second, both men find themselves in a freefall that sends them squarely through the roof of a vats of acid factory, and into a vat of acid that is tipped over by an errant alien spaceship, carrying the two blindly on a wave of acid during a solar eclipse on a leap year, precariously careening onto a bomb-testing site, where a cataclysmic explosion exposes our heroes in waiting to highly toxic radium gases. Then, as fate would have it, magical storm clouds move in, zapping both men with a neon-plaid lightning bolt and raining radioactive ooze, which, through centrifugal and electromagnetic turbulence, causes a powerful earthquake deep in the jungle two-thousand miles away, consequently unearthing a magical crystal with wings that flies to Ernie and Tim's exact location, and, powered by super gamma energy currents, pilots them to open skies until, not paying attention, the crystal clips the top of a billboard, flinging the two back to their apartment miraculously unharmed, when... ,[microwave beeps],
,Ernie:, Hey, the popcorn's ready!
,Johnny:, ...they proceed with movie night and eat slightly overcooked popcorn.
,Tim:, Mmmm... I think you overcooked this a little.
,Johnny:, Suddenly, an amazing reaction to the overcooked popcorn hits them with a jolt of cosmic super energy, metamorphosing Ernie into an incredibly strong, seastar-wearing superhero and Tim into a slightly less strong, but also super sailor-looking guy.
,Tim:, I have the sudden and incredibly urge to breathe water instead of air.
,Ernie:, As do I.
,Johnny:, And that is how they became the superheroes we have come to know as... ,[the heroes dive into the ocean from a dock and pose], Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Defenders of the Deep! ,[The End graphic appears on the TV],
,Barnacle Boy:, Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man?
,Mermaid Man:, ...No, not really.
,Barnacle Boy:, Hmm... Oh, so what do you boys think? Boys? ,[realizes SpongeBob and Patrick have left],
,SpongeBob:, ,[programming microwave for 12 minutes], Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!
,Patrick:, This is gonna be so super awesome!
,SpongeBob:, So superhero awesome!
,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:, No! Stop! But you're not superhero material! Look at those shoes! ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy keep on blabbering until the episode ends],

,SpongeBob:, Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
,Patrick:, It's too bad they're old.
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. ,[real life captain gives a thumbs up and triumphant music plays], The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. ,[fireworks appear],
,Patrick:, Ooh! Pretty lights!
,[At Shady Shoals Retirement Home's cafeteria],
,Mermaid Man:, To the meatloaf! To the broccoli! Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
,Cafeterian:, Here you go, son. Haha.
,Mermaid Man:, To the table, away!
,Barnacle Boy:, Careful! Don't run!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mermaid Man.
,Mermaid Man:, Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
,Barnacle Boy:, What do you want from us?
,SpongeBob:, Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
,Mermaid Man:, Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
,Barnacle Boy:, Will you cut... will you stop calling me ""boy""?
,SpongeBob:, Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. ,[jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating], And he globs onto the undersea dome. ,[puts his mouth on the table], And he starts sucking on the glass. ,[an old fish moves his oatmeal away from SpongeBob in disgust],
,Barnacle Boy:, What's your point, kid?
,SpongeBob:, You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
,Mermaid Man:, Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
,Manager:, ,[enters the cafeteria], What is going on in here?
,Mermaid Man:, ,[points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling], You may kiss the bride! ,[SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home],
,Patrick:, Did you re-unite our heroes?
,SpongeBob:, No, but I'm married. ,[Back at the retirement home],
,Mermaid Man:, ,[he and Barnacle Boy are in rocking chairs], Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
,SpongeBob:, ,[dressed up as a woman and speaking in a Southern accent], Oh, mah. This purse is so big and heavy.
,Patrick:, ,[dressed up as a robber], Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that. ,[grabs SpongeBob's purse],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
,Patrick:, It's working.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Barnacle Boy comes over to him], Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup], Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
,SpongeBob:, ,[approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open], Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
,Barnacle Boy:, Confound it, get away from him!
,Mermaid Man:, ,[wakes up], Stop shoutin'! I'm nappin'!
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[close up to his face], It's not me, you ol' coot!
,Retired Elderly #1:, Yes.
,Retired Elderly #2:, That's me.
,Retired Elderly #3:, I'm over here.
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
,Mermaid Man:, What do you want?
,Barnacle Boy:, This better be good.
,SpongeBob:, This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. ,[The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.],
,Barnacle Boy:, Gah! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
,Mermaid Man:, Evil! Where is it?
,Barnacle Boy:, There it is! ,[points at SpongeBob and Patrick], You know what this means? ,[opens up a box with shiny rings],
,Mermaid Man:, Donuts!
,Barnacle Boy:, Oh, brother. ,[puts the ring on Mermaid Man and then they try to put them together, but they miss, so they do it again, but it doesn't work], Say the oath.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[in his young voice], Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! ,[they put the rings together, and this time it works], Throw a waterball at 'em!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Waterballs! Waterballs! ,[Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens],
,Patrick:, Hehehehehe.
,Barnacle Boy:, Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
,Mermaid Man:, He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:, Dogpaddle away! ,[they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick],
,Patrick:, It's the Raging Whirlpool. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them],
,Mermaid Man:, Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
,Barnacle Boy:, Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:, Sea creatures, unite! ,[they summon the sea creatures, but they are retired, so they come slowly],
,Barnacle Boy:, Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
,Mermaid Man:, Sea creatures, attack!
,SpongeBob:, Pinch me, I must be dreaming. ,[sea creatures, now carrying torches and pitchforks, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick], Mission accomplished, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Yeah, we did it. ,[sea creatures throw them out],
,Mermaid Man:, I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
,Barnacle Boy:, We did it, you ol' coot. ,[they shake hands],
,Mermaid Man:, Who are you? ,[Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed],
,TV Announcer:, The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.],
,[Mermaid Man places a black checker on the board. A ""Pow!"" pow-bubble appears. Barnacle Boy replies by placing a red checker on the board. ""Clack!"" appears. Mermaid Man sweats, then places a black checker to the end of the board. A ""King Me!"" appears. Suddenly the phone rings.],
,Mermaid Man:, It's the Aquaphone! ,[he holds the phone upside down], What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello? ,[Hangs up phone. ""HANG UP!"" appears], The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ,[""SIT!"" appears],
,Barnacle Boy:, Remind you of what?
,Mermaid Man:, Remind me of what?
,TV Announcer:, Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
,SpongeBob:, Wow. That was even better than the old show.
,Patrick:, All thanks to you. ,[SpongeBob winks; ""WINK!"" appears],.

"Narrator:, The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ,[we see a long line to the Krusty Krab], In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.
,Frank:, Will you hurry up?
,Narrator:, A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions. ,If, they weren't the ones causing the problem.
,Mermaid Man:, Let's see... I wanna, no. I wanna, uh, no, uh, hmmm...
,Squidward:, Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispering in Mermaid Man's ear], Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
,Mermaid Man:, I've made my decision.
,Line of Customers:, Hooray!
,Mermaid Man:, One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
,Barnacle Boy:, Now, wait just a darn minute.
,Line of Customers:, Awww!
,Barnacle Boy:, I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty. I want an adult size Krabby Patty.
,Mermaid Man:, The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
,Barnacle Boy:, Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child.
,Mr. Krabs:, The boy’s eyes are bigger than his stomach. ,[laughs],
,Barnacle Boy:, And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots. ,[shows a hair popping out],
,Squidward:, ,[snickering], One Pipsqueak patty ,[close up of the patty], and your bib and highchair.
,Barnacle Boy:, I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
,Mermaid Man:, Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
,Barnacle Boy:, Feed this, old man! ,[slaps the Krabby Patty out of Mermaid Man's hand],
,All except MM and BB:,  Ooooooooh.
,Barnacle Boy:, I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!
,SpongeBob:, I respect you, Barnacle Man!
,Barnacle Man:, That's Barnacle Boy, I mean, man! I... Ohh... forget it, people. I say if you're not going to give me the respect I want as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is... evil.
,SpongeBob:, Evil?
,Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick, & Sandy:, Evil? ,[Mermaid Man does nothing but smile, so Mr. Krabs slaps him],
,Mermaid Man:, Evil!
,Barnacle Man:, I am crossing over... to the dark side! ,[points to dark side of Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Why should I waste money lighting the whole store? ,[villain car comes in, and the window opens revealing Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble in the car],
,Dirty Bubble:, Did someone say evil?
,SpongeBob:, Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble! ,[BB gets in villain car],
,Barnacle Man:, Nighty night, you old goat!
,Mermaid Man:, Nighty-night! ,[to Squidward], Will you tuck me in?
,Realistic Fish Head:, We interrupt your bleak and meaningless lives for this news report. ,[Man Ray zaps a building], Man Ray, ,[Dirty Bubble grabs a local bank while snickering], the Dirty Bubble, and now, playing for the dark side, Barnacle Boy...
,Barnacle Man:, Barnacle Man!

,Barnacle Man:, Shh! ,[rings the doorbell and run off, while laughing],
,Senior Citizen:, ,[opens door], I'll get you crazy kids!
,Realistic Fish Head:, These three have named their new alliance: Every Villain Is Lemons, otherwise known as E.V.I.L.! What can we do? When will this crime wave end? How will we defeat the evil? Why am I asking ,[you], all these questions? Mermaid Man, where are you? ,[Mermaid Man does nothing but smile again, so Mr. Krabs slaps him again],
,Mermaid Man:, Huh? I'm right here! Don't worry, good citizens! Nothing will stop me from defeating the E.V.I.L.! ,[runs outside], Nothing! ,[ice cream truck sounds], Ice cream? I love ice cream! A double scoop of prune with bran sprinkles. ,[he receives an ice cream with a lit fuse], Mmm. ,[MM licks it and takes a big bite but explodes, ""KA-BRAN!"" appears, leaving a hole in his stomach], Goes right through me every time.
,Barnacle Man:, ,[E.V.I.L. is shown as ice cream men], You might as well give up, Mermaid Man, because there are three of us and only one of you. You don't stand a chance. ,[drives off],
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs to Mermaid Man with Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward], Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?
,Mermaid Man:, You're right. ,[sits down], I give up.
,SpongeBob:, You can't give up. What if we help you?
,Mermaid Man:, No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?
,SpongeBob:, Okay!
,Mermaid Man:, Who wants to save the world?
,SpongeBob:, I do!
,Sandy:, I do!
,Patrick:, I do!

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[confronts Squidward], Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! ,[runs back to the Krusty Krab; Squidward grumbles], 
,Mermaid Man:, Then it's settled! To the Mermalair! ,[Transition to the Mermalair],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! The Mermalair!
,Mermaid Man:, These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!
,SpongeBob:, Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.
,Mermaid Man:, Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours.
,Sandy:, Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.
,Mermaid Man:, Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?
,Squidward:, I can think of three good reasons.
,Narrator:, ,[SpongeBob is running at lightning fast speed in his costume], The Quickster...with the uncanny ability to run really...quick!
,SpongeBob:, Want to see me run to that mountain and back? ,[doesn't move], Want to see me do it again?

,Sandy:, Does this outfit make me look fat?
,Narrator:, The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.
,Mermaid Man:, So, it's agreed. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives.
,Chief:, Super Acquaintances, we need your help.
,SpongeBob:, Holy halibut! It's the chief!
,Chief:, Thank you for the introduction, Quickster, but we all know who I am! More importantly, we've found information on the whereabouts of E.V.I.L.
,Patrick:, The whose abouts of what?
,Sandy:, You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say ""Salsa Verde.""
,Chief:, Our sources last found E.V.I.L. harassing teenagers up at ""Make Out Reef."" You know, Make-Out Reef? ,[makes out with himself], Whoo hoo hoo!
,SpongeBob:, Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!
,Mermaid Man:, Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!
,Squidward:, Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.
,Mermaid Man:, To Make-Out Reef, ,[chair falls backwards], away!
,Patrick:, Does this mean we're not getting pizza? ,[scene cuts to Make-Out Reef at night],
,John & Nancy:, Stop, please!
,E.V.I.L.:, John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!

,Mermaid Man:, Leave those young lovers alone!
,Man Ray:, Well, if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!
,Mermaid Man:, You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!
,Man Ray:, You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!

,Barnacle Man:, Oh no, please, mercy!
,Squidward:, Krakatoa! ,[lava shoots out onto The Quickster],
,SpongeBob:, Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off! ,[starts running in a circle fast], Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
,Patrick:, I'll save you, Quickster, ahh! ,[stretches his arms to try and save Quickster, but ends up getting caught, and flies out with his arms overstretched. The villains look at each other in confusion],
,Mermaid Man:, I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls! ,[creates a water ball with his hands and concentrates, but targets Captain Magma instead], Aha!
,Squidward:, Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag... ,[gets hit by the water ball], ma... ,[coughs, then melts to pile of ash],
,Sandy:, Well, I guess it's up to me! ,[turns invisible and only her footprints show in the ground], I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise. ,[a boat hits her, sending her through the sign and to the cliff, while still invisible], Ahhhh! ,[land on the ground], Boom!
,SpongeBob:, Get it off! Get it off! ,[eventually stops, but only shown as shoes], Whew...I'm glad that's over!
,[villains look at fallen heroes and Mermaid Man falls backwards],
,Barnacle Man:, We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.! ,[approaches the fallen Mermaid Man], You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands.
,Mermaid Man:, Okay, what do you want?
,Man Ray:, World domination! Tell him we want world domination!
,Dirty Bubble:, And make him eat dirt! Hahaha! ,[Man Ray stares at him], In addition to the...domination thing.
,Barnacle Man:, Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three...
,Man Ray:, Come on, world domination!
,Barnacle Man:, I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.
,Dirty Bubble:, ,[he and Man Ray are shocked], Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?
,Barnacle Man:, Need a hand, superpal? ,[both start to get tears in their eyes as they grab and shake hands. ""FRIEND!"" appears],
,Mermaid Man:, Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty! ,[leaves with Barnacle Boy],
,Man Ray:, Was that it? Oh, that's sickening.
,Dirty Bubble:, Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with the killer shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks...
,Man Ray:, ,[Dirty Bubble continues to waffle], Oh, Neptune, shut up! ,[at the Krusty Krab. Barnacle Boy is eating an adult-sized Krabby Patty],
,Mermaid Man:, How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle ,[winks], Man?
,Barnacle Man:, Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing. ,[Mermaid Man laughs, then Barnacle Boy laughs, SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward come in, all injured and laughing, the guy at make-out reef who was kissing the pillow is laughing, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble are in jail, laughing, and the chief is making out with himself, he turns around and laughs hysterically],

,Narrator:, And also these guys. ,[Barnacle Boy enters the Krusty Krab],
,Barnacle Boy:, I told you I'm not hungry, Mermaid Man!
,Mermaid Man:, N-nonsense, Barnacle Boy, we've got to keep up our strength for the fight against evil!
,Barnacle Boy:, What a dive.
,Mermaid Man:, To the register! ,[runs to the register], Away!
,Squidward:, Can I help you?
,Mermaid Man:, A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me, and a silly meal for the lad.
,Barnacle Boy:, It's not for the toy, I just... I've gotta fit in the tights, y'know? ,[he smiles nervously],
,Squidward:, Whatever. Five dollars, please.
,Mermaid Man:, You got it, bucky. ,[removes his left seashell cup, opens the shell up like a clutch purse and pulls out a metal nut], Will this cover it? ,[close up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard],
,Squidward:, No.
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[confronts Squidward], Listen, big nose, ,[points at Mermaid Man], that guy has been saving your butt since before you were born. Don't you got a living legend discount or something?
,Squidward:, This is a restaurant, not a lending library. ,[pokes Barnacle Boy], And who are you calling big nose, ,[pokes Barnacle Boy again], big nose? ,[both press noses against each other. Barnacle Boy gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward],
,Barnacle Boy:, Well, next time danger threatens, don't expect any help from us.
,Squidward:, ,[grabs the bill. Sarcastically], I'm shakin'. Heh. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[slowly breaks through wall], Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must... get... autograph! ,[stretches arm to pull a pen from Tom's shirt pocket and stretches second arm to grab a paper from the window],
,Mermaid Man:, If you wanna grow up strong like me,... ,[shows his fat belly, shocking Barnacle Boy], you gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes our waiter.
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs while making a weird face], Autograph!

,Mermaid Man:, Quick, lad, ,[pants falls down], to the invisible boat mobile! ,[runs outside, while holding his pants], Away!
,Barnacle Boy:, Where'd we park?
,Mermaid Man:, Uhh...
,SpongeBob:, Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone. ,[gasps], Mermaid Man's belt!
,Mermaid Man:, Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm! ,[he pulls it out, and makes as to press a button. A car flickers in and out of visibility thrice, making beeps as well], There she is! ,[they run over and jump in the car. Barnacle Boy hits the seat divider],
,Barnacle Boy:, Eee-ow! ,[rubs his behind], I told you we shoulda got the automatic!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, guys! Wait up! ,[pulling out Mermaid Man's belt; slow motion], I've got something for you...
,Barnacle Boy:, Floor it! ,[both speed off in the boat],
,SpongeBob:, You forgot your belt! You forgot— ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away], Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it. ,[makes one step in the boat's direction... then sprints back to the kitchen with the belt on], Or not. ,[giggles], I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does. ,[presses the belt, and a pickle barrel shrinks], Whoa. ,[grabs the shrunken barrel], The small ray. ,[he giggles and smiles mischievously],
,Squidward:, Here's your shake, sir. ,[he starts to hand him the shake, but he is startled by a loud noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle, causing him to accidentally drop the shake on the guy's head. The guy punches Squidward in the face and storms out. There are more flashes, noises and giggles from the kitchen. Squidward gets up and he holds his head], Grr.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Hands a tiny Krabby Patty to a cockroach], There you go. Come again, sir. ,[Squidward barges in], 
,Squidward:, SpongeBob. What's going on in here? Huh? ,[SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula, and a cockroach is eating a Krabby Patty while sitting on a shrunken dining table], Why's everything all tiny?
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns the belt around to hide it from Squidward], I don't know.
,Squidward:, What do you got there?
,SpongeBob:, Nothing.
,Squidward:, No, really?
,SpongeBob:, Nothing.
,Squidward:, You've got something, alright. Let's see it. ,[Squidward grabs SpongeBob and sees Mermaid Man's belt],
,SpongeBob:, No, no!
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
,SpongeBob:, Yes.
,Squidward:, Wow. I can't believe he'd lend it to you.
,SpongeBob:, Me, uh... either. ,[chuckles nervously],
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], He didn't lend it to you, did he?
,SpongeBob:, Please don't tell!
,Squidward:, ,[angry], You stole it!
,SpongeBob:, Please don't tell!
,Squidward:, Oh, I'm telling.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
,Squidward:, Uh-oh! ,[points at the phone hanging on the kitchen wall], There's the phone.
,SpongeBob:, Don't!
,Squidward:, I'm walking towards the phone! ,[slowly walks towards phone],
,SpongeBob:, No!
,Squidward:, ,[slowly reaches for the phone], I'm getting closer to the phone.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sobbing], Do-o-o-n't!
,Squidward:, ,[picks up the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man], And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
,SpongeBob:, ,[wails and tears himself], I'm begging you!
,Squidward:, Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid... ,[SpongeBob shrinks Squidward.  He lands on the table], What the? What? ,[phones hits Squidward on the head], Ow!
,Mermaid Man:,  ,[on phone], Hello? Hello?
,Squidward:, What did you do to me?!
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!
,SpongeBob:, Uh... uh, okay, uh...
,Squidward:, I said now!
,SpongeBob:, Uh... ,[belt is shown to have several complicated buttons], Uh...
,Squidward:, Do you hear me?! ,[SpongeBob zaps Squidward and he appears with multiple eyes with hissing snakes], Holy fish paste! Get it off me! Get it off me! ,[takes eyes off him and pants in fear], Don't you know how to work that thing?!
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, I can do it! ,[SpongeBob changes Squidward into a burning mess, then changes him to have an enormous nose, then to have no skin, then cut in half by scissors, then changed into more things off-screen while SpongeBob looks in fright. Squidward screams whenever SpongeBob changes him],
,Squidward:, ,[looks burnt after SpongeBob’s failed attempts to revert him], Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and--
,SpongeBob:, ,[snatching Squidward], No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience. ,[he runs to Patrick's house, where Patrick is sleeping], Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[wakes up due to surprise], Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look. ,[shows Patrick the shrunken Squidward],
,Patrick:, A Squidward action figure! ,[grabs Squidward], Let me play with him!
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Fighter pilot! ,[imitates jet plane diving, machine gunfire and explosion noises], Dive bomb!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[about to punch Squidward], And then comes a giant fist!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
,Patrick:, Oh... ,[about to punch Squidward anyway], And then comes a giant -- ,[Squidward screams], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops Patrick], Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
,Patrick:, Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.
,SpongeBob:, You think so?
,Patrick:, Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size. ,[pulls out a pickle], Like this pickle! See? They like each other!
,Squidward:, N-n-n-n-no. ,[Patrick bangs them together as if to kiss. Squidward is disgusted],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
,Patrick:, Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Patrick:, You got it set to ,[points to the M], 'M' for Mini when it should be set to ,[turns M around], 'W' for Wumbo.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
,Patrick:, Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He, she, me... wumbo! Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!
,Squidward:, ,[while Patrick is saying ""we'll have the wumbo""], I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
,Patrick:, Well, all right, then. Let her rip! ,[SpongeBob uses Mermaid Man's belt and presses something to try and ""regrow"" Squidward. Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk now], It worked!
,SpongeBob:, Oh no!
,Patrick:, Look, SpongeBob's giant! ,[SpongeBob grabs them], Can I be giant next?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
,Patrick:, You're kidding! ,[pulls out his pickle], Good thing I still got this pickle! ,[kisses the pickle three times. Pan over to Squidward],
,Squidward:, Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[yells in Squidward's face], No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise. ,[gets a jar and puts them in], Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.
,Patrick:, You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something. Heheh.
,SpongeBob:, It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it. ,[Sandy suddenly appears],
,Sandy:, Howdy, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Sandy! ,[shrinks Sandy],
,Sandy:, ,[lands on the ground], What did you... For cryin' out... What did y'all do to me?
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and... ,[Larry appears],

,Fish #3:, Hey, SpongeBob! ,[shrinks fish],
,Fish #4:, What's up, Sponge? ,[shrinks fish],
,SpongeBob:, ,[tries to fit everyone in the jar], Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
,Sandy:, Well, you can't leave us small forever!
,SpongeBob:, You don't understand! ,[SpongeBob's mother is seen in the jar],
,Mrs. SquarePants:, ,[gently and soothingly], SpongeBob. You need to admit your mistakes.
,SpongeBob:, Mom?
,Mermaid Man:, Your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand.
,Barnacle Boy:, You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!
,Mermaid Man:, Oh, yeah.
,SpongeBob:, Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
,Mermaid Man:, ,[comforting SpongeBob], Awww, don't worry, son. I understand! ,[SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes], Why, I remember back when I first used the belt, the year was nineteen aught eleventeen twelve, why I believe the president.
,Everyone:, Just tell him how to unshrink us!
,Mermaid Man:, Oh, yes. The unshrink ray. Let's see, uh, uh— Did you set it to Wumbo?
,Everyone:, What?! ,[the jar rumbles from anger and everyone flies out of the jar, spells out and form GET SPONGEBOB!], Get SpongeBob! ,[climbs up SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head],
,Squidward:, Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom... in my own home! ,[kicks SpongeBob's stomach],
,Sandy:, And I need an elevator to climb one stair! Hi-ya! ,[punches his brain],
,Mermaid Man:, We've been shrinking for years!
,Barnacle Boy:, But this is ridiculous! ,[both kick his eyeballs. Dale kicks his pelvis, Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging on to his spine, Larry kicks his knee. SpongeBob is shown getting hurt from the outside],
,Everyone:, Everything's too big!
,SpongeBob:, I've got it! ,[Squidward saws a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone, but stop when SpongeBob shrinks the city], Ta-da! ,[everyone looks outside through his holes], Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small! ,[everybody leaves SpongeBob's body], And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese! ,[turns the shrink ray into W and towards him like a camera and shrinks himself],
,Squidward:, I guess this is okay.
,Larry:, Yeah, what's the difference?
,Nancy:, Good idea, SpongeBob. ,[everyone cheers, balloons and other party items are flying, as a bus comes back and Plankton gets off of it],
,Plankton:, Well, it's great to be back! ,[notices small Bikini Bottom], Huh?

"TV Announcer:, The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join Bikini Bottom's noblest, boldest, oldest superheroes as they bravely prepare for vacation. ,[both pack their clothes into their bags while the words “FOLD” and “PACK” come up], But wait! While our heroes relax at Leisure Village, who will watch the Mermalair? ,[Barnacle Boy opens the doors and SpongeBob and Patrick jump in],
,SpongeBob:, ManSponge...
,Patrick:, ...and BoyPatrick
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Reporting for duty.
,Barnacle Boy:, Yeah, yeah, follow me.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Up, up, and away!
,Mermaid Man:, Evil!
,Barnacle Boy:, Now, we want you boys to keep an eye on the place. Water the plants, and make sure that...
,SpongeBob:, Oh my gosh, Patrick. This is the greatest wall of superhero super gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
,Patrick:, I'll get the Aqua-Glove.
,Mermaid Man:, Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff.
,SpongeBob:, What about the Orb of Confusion? ,[turns the orb on and makes confused faces],
,Mermaid Man:, ,[turns it off], No, no! Prolonged exposure to the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!
,Patrick:, ,[opens the boat's door], What about the Invisible Boatmobile?
,Barnacle Boy:, Especially not the Invisible Boatmobile. ,[closes the boat's door], When we say don't touch anything, we mean ,don't touch anything,. Do you understand?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Loud and clear, trusted boy companion!
,Barnacle Boy:, Well, great. Here are the keys. ,[SpongeBob takes the key from his hand], We'll see you in a week.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[both run out the door], Up, up, and away!
,SpongeBob:, Come Boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay. ,[both flip into the other room while letting out battle cries],

,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?
,SpongeBob:, Looks like he's frozen or something.
,Patrick:, FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO.
,SpongeBob:, It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... ,[licks the chamber], ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him. ,[Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE], Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!
,Patrick:, But you said you had a question.
,SpongeBob:, We could get in trouble.
,Patrick:, Well, that's not a question. ,[they both argue when Man Ray's eyes start to light up],
,SpongeBob:, He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! ,[pulls level up back to FREEZE],
,Man Ray:, I'm free! Hahaha!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
,Man Ray:, By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once.
,SpongeBob:, Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.
,Man Ray:, Why... ,NOT?!,
,SpongeBob:, Because you're evil!
,Man Ray:, You mean, if I was good, then you'd let me go?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, sure, why not?
,Man Ray:, Then, uh, in that case... I am good.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Man Ray:, Yes, really.
,SpongeBob:, Really, really?
,Man Ray:, Yes, yes, really, really.
,SpongeBob:, Really, really, really?
,Man Ray:, Yes, yes, already! I'm good! I'm good! Now let me out of here or you'll suffer dire consequences.
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's good enough for me. ,[SpongeBob pulls the lever back to ""UNFREEZE"" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground],
,Man Ray:, You fools, prepare to be eradicated. ,[tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs], What's wrong with me? Hahaha. What is this...Hahaha...infernal contraption?!
,SpongeBob:, Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17.
,Narrator:, ,[showing a picture of the belt], As seen in episode #17!
,Patrick:, Oh, I love that episode.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, me too, me too.
,Man Ray:, I'll never get out of here wearing this belt. ,[chuckles], I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. ,[chuckles again], Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
,SpongeBob:, Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
,Man Ray:, Oh, sob! Oh, cry. ,[opens and closes his eyes], Oh, woe is me. You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp],
,SpongeBob:, We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go.
,Man Ray:, ,[turns around], Ahh, that would be fantastic! ,[chuckles], I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready for your first day at goodness school? ,[Man Ray puts an apple on his desk], Pat, get your wallet out. ,[Patrick gets his wallet out of his pocket], Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. ,[Patrick tosses it on the ground], Now, what do you do?
,Man Ray:, Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.
,Patrick:, Doesn't look familiar to me.
,Man Ray:, What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
,Patrick:, Nope, it's not mine.
,Man Ray:, It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
,Patrick:, Return what to who?
,Man Ray:, ,[facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID], Aren't you Patrick Star?
,Patrick:, Yup.
,Man Ray:, And this is your ID.
,Patrick:, Yup.
,Man Ray:, I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.
,Patrick:, That makes sense to me.
,Man Ray:, Then take it.
,Patrick:, It's not my wallet.
,Man Ray:, ,[in anger and frustration], ,You dim bulb! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off!, ,[SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs],
,SpongeBob:, No. Wrong. ,[SpongeBob pushes button], Good people don't rip other people's arms off ,[Man Ray chuckles], Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?
,Man Ray:, Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help with... ,[Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot], Ow!
,Patrick:, Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
,Man Ray:, I noticed you was... ,[Patrick drops package again], Ow!
,Patrick:, Oops. Gotta start again.
,Man Ray:, Would, ,[Patrick drops package again], Ow!
,Patrick:, Oops!
,Man Ray:, ,[Growls in anger], You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?
,Patrick:, My wallets.
,Man Ray:, ,[Screams in fury. He grabs Patrick's head],
,Patrick:, No! SpongeBob, tickle him! ,[Man Ray slams Patrick into the ground. SpongeBob presses the tickle button],
,Man Ray:, ,[laughs], It tickles, but it's worth it. ,[continues slamming Patrick into the ground, while still laughing],
,SpongeBob:, Alright, goodness lesson number three. ,[Patrick is shown angry and severely injured], Uhh, let's see. ,[Patrick grabs the remote],
,Patrick:, I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
,Man Ray:, Umm... 62?
,Patrick:, Wrong! ,[pushes button],
,Man Ray:, Haha. Stop.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
,Patrick:, Let go of it, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad.
,Patrick:, Let go!
,SpongeBob:, No, you let go!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Let... GO! ,[remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire],
,Man Ray:, Frequency rising. Belt out of control. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Belt on too hard. ,[he continues to laugh], It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop! ,[tears come out as he laughs], Haha. Please!
,SpongeBob:, Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
,Patrick:, Peanuts?
,SpongeBob:, No. Please.
,Patrick:, Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
,SpongeBob:, Rehabilitated.
,Patrick:, Gesundheit.
,SpongeBob:, It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. ,[unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops], Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. ,[Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons], Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. ,[Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it], We're not supposed to touch that, either. ,[Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove], We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. ,[He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick], Good people have no use for weapons such as... ,[Man Ray zaps them into dust], THOOOOSE!
,Man Ray:, ,[laughs], The only thing I'm good at is being evil. ,[door opens and Man Ray runs], So long, suckers.
,Patrick:, What's that smell, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
,Patrick:, Good, I thought it was my skin.
,SpongeBob:, Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...
,Patrick:, ...and Barnacle Boy! ,[both slide down the poles and get their costumes on],
,SpongeBob:, To the Invisible Boatmobile! ,[both stop in the invisible boat],
,Patrick:, Ignition, on!
,SpongeBob:, Wait! I don't have a license.
,Patrick:, Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. ,[shapes hand into a rectangle],
,SpongeBob:, You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. ,[they scream as the boat rams through the wall and into a street light],
,Patrick:, Thank goodness for invisible seat belts.
,Man Ray:, Out of my way, fools. You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to Man Ray!
,SpongeBob:, Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the Orb of Confusion. ,[Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion], Take this! ,[turns it on and gets all confused], Doy. Duh.
,Man Ray:, Well, that was easy. ,[heads to the bank where he kicks in the door], Hahaha. All right, people! Everybody, stand right where you are.
,[citizens gasp],
,Man Ray:, I want you to, uh... ,[Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too], No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... ,[chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling], STOP LAUGHING, YOU FOOLS.
,Bank Lady:, What can I do for you, sir?
,Man Ray:, Well, I'll tell you what you can do. ,[points glove at the lady], Gimme all of your... ,[Man Ray chuckles again], G-gimme, gimme all of your... ,[Man Ray is still chuckling], Give me... ,[he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on], Ahh! The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle. The urge to do bad is gone! ,[sighs], I guess I'll just open a checking account. ,[Man Ray returns to SpongeBob and Patrick and turns the Orb of Confusion off],
,SpongeBob:, Doy. ,[gasps], Man Ray!
,Man Ray:, No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! ,[Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob], I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. ,[walks off], 
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Man Ray! Wow. We did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. We saved the day. Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?
,Patrick:, Uhh... ,[still has a confused look on his face],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick?

,Mermaid Man:, That's right. The conch signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.
,Barnacle Boy:, But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll ,be, trouble. You got that?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sirs!
,Mermaid Man:, Good boy.

,Barnacle Boy:, ,[Crushed], Coming!
,[Mermaid Man jumps onto the couch. Barnacle Boy, holding his swimsuit, wobbles onto the chair.

He is laying on the ground with his eyes shut and his tongue out. Gary is next to him. There is also a spot light on him. The tire squealing and the cat shrieking is heard. The angle changes.

,SpongeBob:, But...
,Barnacle Boy:, But nothing! We can't go around socializing. We have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies.
,Mermaid Man:, Barnacle Boy, think about it. Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to.
,Barnacle Boy:, Alright, okay. You can blow the conch every once in a while. Just give us ,[He takes the jar of mayo.], something to do when we ,[while he struggles to open the jar of mayo.], show up.
,SpongeBob and Mermaid Man:, ,[While jumping in the air.], Yay!
,[The bubble transition goes to the Shady Shoals' cafeteria, where Barnacle Boy is eating soup. The conch signal blows as he grabs a spoon full of soup. He blows on it and Mermaid Man grabs Barnacle Boy's arm, while running, which causes him to drop the spoon.],
,Mermaid Man:, Danger!
,[At SpongeBob's house, in his bathroom, Mermaid Man fixes SpongeBob's sink and Barnacle boy unclogs SpongeBob's shower drain. SpongeBob is shown blowing the conch signal.

It cuts to the living room, where he is in a barber's chair, reading the newspaper, Mermaid Man is shining SpongeBob's shoes, and Barnacle Boy is giving him a head massage. It then cuts to SpongeBob, at night, on his house, using the conch signal. It then cuts to SpongeBob, in bed, next to a teddy bear. Mermaid Man is reading a book and Barnacle Boy is holding milk and plate of cookies. It cuts to SpongeBob blowing the conch signal three different times. On the last time, Barnacle Boy takes it out of SpongeBob's mouth.],

He tries again, but he still doesn't succeed.], I'll destroy it when I get back to the ,[Puts the conch in his pocket], , uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...
,Mermaid Man:, Barnacle Boy, ,[While getting up.], don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow. Or the villain. Besides, I remember another ,[He takes out a picture.], young ,[The image shows Barnacle Boy as a kid.], whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.
,[Mermaid Man chuckles.],
,Barnacle Boy:, You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot.
,[Mermaid Man walks up to SpongeBob, still crying],
,Mermaid Man:, Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility. ,[SpongeBob stops crying.], But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?

,[At The Diner],
,SpongeBob:, I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow.

,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[goes to the jukebox],

,Patrick:, Don't! ,[The scene shows an extreme close-up of The candy bar and SpongeBob's mouth. SpongeBob moves his tongue closer, almost touching the bar.],Stop it! ,[As SpongeBob chomps lightly on the bar], Don't! ,[The scene shows a close-up of Patrick.], Oh!

I should have expected this after the way you stole that balloon!
,SpongeBob:, Did I, Patrick, did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it?!
,Patrick:, Oh, that's it! ,[Patrick stomps his foot down on the firewood. The fire lights up again.], Yow! ,[Patrick screams and hops around holding his foot in pain.], First the balloon, now my candy bar... you're out of control! I'm... ,[menacingly], ...I'm telling on you.
,SpongeBob:,  [,gasps,] Not if I tell on you first!

,Patrick:, I'll beat you there!
,[He runs off-screen. The two are shown in running next to each other. The two are shown running from a worm's eye-view],

,Patrick:, No, you are!

,[The scene then shows a worm's-eye-view of the desk],
,Officer Rob:, What can I do for you, boys?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[they look at each other], We stole a balloon! ,[both start sobbing],
,Patrick:, ,[off-camera], I'm not good.
,SpongeBob:, ,[off-camera], We stole a balloon.
,Officer John:, ,[While walking into frame], What's the problem here?
,Officer Rob:, Well, it appears these two stole a balloon.
,SpongeBob:, ,[As he and Patrick hold back tears], What are you going to do to us?
,Officer Rob:, ,[Officer John whispers in Officer Rob's ear], Okay, follow me. ,[The scene changes to show a wide shot of Cell 1B.] [As SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the cell], If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. ,[closes the cell door and waits for a moment], Okay, time's up. ,[opens the cell], Now, get out.
,SpongeBob:, But...But...we stole a balloon.
,Officer Rob:, Yeah, on Free Balloon Day.
,[The two officers laugh. The scene changes to a medium of the exterior of the Police Station. Officer Rob has some lollipops in his fin.], How about some lollipops for the roads, boys?
,[SpongeBob takes the lollipops. He gives one to Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, Let's vow never to borrow anything without permission again.
,Patrick:, You said it! ,[The two put both their lollipops together, but Patrick's is already eaten. The scene shows a close up of Patrick's face. Patrick's mouth is covered with some lollipop residue.], All right! Which one of you flatfoots stole my lollipop? ,[The scene shows a wide shot of the four. SpongeBob and the two officers start laughing. Patrick joins in. The scene then shows the island with the moon and the laughing stops.], I mean it.

,[SpongeBob walks while brushing teeth, walking in mid-air after the first step down the stairs. SpongeBob suddenly falls and crashes on the wall. A barrel tosses the table, which tosses him into a toaster. The toaster ejects the sooty SpongeBob and he crashes onto his TV],
,Gunther Fitz:, Hey there! Have you recently been involved in an accident? Well, have you?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets up], Well, yes. Yes, I have.
,Gunther Fitz:, Well, then you need life insurance!

,Patrick:, Oh boy, life insurance! ,[jumps around joyfully], Life insurance, life insurance, life insurance, life insurance! ,[suddenly stops moving in mid-air], What's life insurance?
,SpongeBob:, I'm not sure, but I think that means for the rest of our lives we are protected. We can't get hurt.
,Patrick:, ,[stares at the contract, closely chews the contract, then spits out the contract], This contract tastes legitimate, but I don't believe it! ,[squeezes moist contract],
,SpongeBob:, Well, let's try to get hurt and we'll see.
,Patrick:, Huh. Well finally, something I'm good at!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick playfully pillow-fight],

,Squidward:, Well, you're not gonna do any damage with soft pillows! ,[throws pillow at Patrick and gives them a rake], Here, try this.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[hits Squidward with the rake and sends him flying into his house], Squidward was wrong. Didn't hurt him, just made him disappear.
,[Patrick throws the rake into Squidward's house. Squidward gets up and looks in the mirror. His toupee is on his nose.],
,Squidward:, Ah! Sea spider! ,[hits himself with a rake until he falls backwards],

,Squidward:, Ah! My baby!
,[Squidward retrieves his toupee from the toilet and growls. He stomps over to Patrick's house.],
,Squidward:, Once again, I'm asking, what are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, It's our final test. We're trying to get jellyfish to sting us to prove we can't get hurt.
,Squidward:, What?
,[Patrick takes out his megaphone, puts his jellyfish whistle in the mouth, and blows it. A large jellyfish appears above them.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Oh! Me! Me! Sting me! Over here!
,Patrick:, Sting me, sting me, sting me!

,SpongeBob:, Gee, Squidward, ,[puts out flame on his toupee], maybe you should get some life insurance.
,Squidward:, What are you yammering about?
,SpongeBob:, I bought some life insurance for Patrick and myself and now we can never be hurt.
,Patrick:, Yeah! To test out the life insurance, we even built a super dangerous obstacle course across the street! ,[points to the obstacle course],
,SpongeBob:, We call it, ""The Sushi Maker."" ,[thunder claps], Squidward, I think you need this more than I. I would like to present you with my life insurance policy. ,[hands him his life insurance contract],

,SpongeBob:, Uh, Squidward, I don't think you should lick that. It's got germs.
,Squidward:, Ha! Germs can't hurt me. Nothing can hurt me!
,[Squidward licks the germ-infested sherbet, which grosses out SpongeBob. Squidward throws the sherbet on the tough guy's head.],
,Squidward:, As a matter of fact, do you know what I'm gonna do now? I'm gonna run your super dangerous obstacle course. You know why?

,Mr. Krabs:, What goes on, boyos?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward is gonna try out The Sushi Maker.
,Mr. Krabs:, Why does he want to do that?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. He's got life insurance. He can't be hurt.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's not how life insurance works.
,Patrick:, It's not?
,Mr. Krabs:, Course not! ,[shows chalkboard that demonstrates life insurance], Life insurance is money the beneficiary gets when a person dies. By the way, who gets the money?
,SpongeBob:, Well, let's see. ,[swipes the life insurance from Squidward's pocket], No name here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hooray! ,[takes out pen and signs the contract], Eugene H. Krabs. Go, Squidward! ,[switches to cheerleading outfit], Yay! Fly high! Do or die! Preferably the latter. ,[chuckles],
,SpongeBob:, D-d-d-d-do or die?! Squidward, come down! You're not invincible! Life insurance is not what you think! You were right! Oh, it was just dumb luck!

,Squidward:, Oh, what are those ninnies going on about now? I can't hear you! Just shut up and watch me! ,[puts on toupee just as SpongeBob and Patrick shake the latter], Nah—hey!
,SpongeBob:, Come back, Squidward! Don't do this!
,Squidward:, Will you stop shaking it?
,[Squidward falls off the diving board and lands into the tub of boiling lava. He jumps out in pain, hits the spring and flies into a steel wall. He falls onto the spiky conveyor belt's lever, which it turns on. Squidward falls onto the conveyor belt and it takes him to the rolling wheel with sharp corals on it.],
,Squidward:, No, no, no, no, no!
,[Squidward gets rolled on by the sharp corals, leaving his face bruised. Squidward gets pummeled by boxing gloves until he becomes liquid. The liquefied Squidward falls onto a chair. Four robotic arms grab him, stretch him and roll him up into a ball. He is placed into a cannon and it fires Squidward far off into the distance until he hits the high school bell. He falls in front of the front doors just as the high school students march out and trample on top of him.],
,Squidward:, Ow...
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, guess what I learned today. Apparently, a life insurance policy doesn't protect a person from injury. Heh, how about that?
,Squidward:, Ha, how 'bout that? ,[spits out a tooth],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, how did you survive The Sushi Maker?
,Squidward:, ,[takes off his toupee], It had to be this.
,SpongeBob:, Ah!

,Police Officer:, Why? What he'd do? Rob a bank?
,Frank:, Worse! He'd tried to steal the Krabby Patty formula.
,Police Officer:, Oh-kay.
,Frank:, So that's why we keep him behind these impenetrable 6-inch steel doors. ,[knocks on the door and the door opens], Of course, it helps to lock it. ,[They both run into the cell], He's gone! He's so small, he could be anywhere!

,SpongeBob:, Would you help us by joining our band?
,Squidward:, ,[gets up], Well, I could help you, but I wouldn't soil my art playing Rock-N-Roll; dressing all in black, wearing boots covered in spikes… ,[as he continues, he imagine that it's worth it, and slowly changes his mind], playing enormous stadiums filled with screaming, adoring fans… ,[Squidward smiles to the idea], clapping, demanding encores, cheering me… ,[He imitates cheering, stops after a few seconds], Oh, uh, changed my mind.

,Plankton:, ,[Starts to sweat maniacally], Uh, if you guys don't like the name, uh…
,SpongeBob:, I… LOVE IT! It's kind of vague and mysterious.
,Patrick:, Can I get mine in pink? ,[Plankton growls. The scene skips to where they're wearing the shirt and Patrick laughs. Patrick's shirt color matches his skin perfectly], It looks like a tattoo!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Plankton, can our first song go like this? ,[makes a loud bass sound], And then turn into one of those songs that goes… ,[makes a high pitched screech],
,Plankton:, ,[covers his ears, and then resumes to his normal attitude], Yes, perfect, now all we need are the lyrics. You know something personal. Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?
,SpongeBob:, Or… One about my new friend Plankton?
,Plankton:, Stop it! ,[growls after SpongeBob stops],
,SpongeBob:, Or the adventures of…
,Plankton:, ,[clips SpongeBob's lips with a tool], The best kind of lyrics are the ones that are deep and revealing. Something only you know… ,[coughs], Secret recipe.
,Patrick:, I once searched for my innermost secrets. All I found was this. ,[Shows that he is holding his heart],

,Plankton:, It's my… uh… recording equipment. ,[Laughs evilly],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Excited], Oh, my gosh! What do I do?
,Plankton:, ,[scoots a chair next to SpongeBob], Just take a seat here, and I'll strap you in. ,[SpongeBob sits down, Plankton straps SpongeBob's arms on the chair and puts a pair of headphones on SpongeBob], Now just relax and let the equipment do its job. ,[The machine starts to beep and make sucking noises. SpongeBob's brain is seen going through the headphone wire into the machine],let's see what's locked in his subconscious. ,[The machine makes static crackles. When Plankton finds a ""station"" on the radio, SpongeBob is the speaker. SpongeBob sings songs just like a radio],

He smacks the machine], What's going- ,[Screams only to realize that Patrick is wearing the headphones, groaning, and the machine explodes. Plankton starts crying], I'm a failure.
,SpongeBob:, Cheer up, Plankton. We've still got a whole week before our first gig at the Krusty Krab.
,Plankton:, ,[stops crying], At the Krusty Krab?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh, but old man Krabs doesn't want us bugging the customers. So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there.
,Plankton:, When nobody's there? ,[makes a purring noise with drool coming out of his mouth at the thought of it],
,[The scene is skipped to where they start practicing. SpongeBob is playing Plankton's guitar, Patrick is doing his drums, and Plankton, not very excited, plays only one note on his mini-keyboard. The scene cuts to outside in front of Squidward and SpongeBob's houses, then the scene cuts to Squidward exercising. He makes one more and he has huge muscles],
,Squidward:, My perfect dream-body. ,[runs out of his house with his bass guitar and goes into SpongeBob's house to practice. They then make noises that sound like they're practicing, causing SpongeBob's house to dance],
,Narrator:, One week later…
,[Cut to the street where the four are heading towards the Krusty Krab at nighttime. They're all wearing their Rock-N-Roll outfits. From a distance, a tire screeching sound is heard, and the noise is later revealed to be from a police car],
,Plankton:, Oh, no, it's the cops. I can't let them see me!
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Plankton:, Why? Uh, cops are autograph hounds. Yeah, they're always after me.
,SpongeBob:, Mm, that's tough. Don't worry, I'll hide you. ,[Sucks Plankton into his nose. The police car stops in front of them],
,Officer John:, Hey, what are you kids up to this late?
,SpongeBob:, We're on our way to our first gig. We're in a band.
,Officer John:, A band, huh, well, that's, uh… Oh. ,[notices a green thing on SpongeBob's nose], Uh, you've got a, uh…
,SpongeBob:, Got a, uh, what? ,[laughs],
,Officer John:, Uh… It's right… ,[points to a nostril on his face],
,SpongeBob:, Yes? ,[Laughs again],
,Officer John:, ,[motions to wipe it off. Something, which is actually Plankton's legs, comes out], Just keep your nose clean, kid. ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, officer. ,[blows his nose, and blows out Plankton], They're gone.
,Plankton:, You will never speak of this to anyone. ,[Scene skips to in front of the Krusty Krab.],  Come on, come on, hurry up.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, I just need to get the key out. ,[hums while opening the door, but fails twice to get the key in the key hole. Plankton grabs the key],
,Plankton:, Give me that, you incompetent fool. ,[opens the door and drops the key on the ground, then goes on the ground], Yes, the Krabby Patty Formula is mine! Uh, I mean, we'll have a great time! ,[goes inside and whispers to himself], Now where does Krabs keep that formula?
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams as he goes inside], Whoo, let's rock!
,Patrick:, Yeah!
,Squidward:, We're gonna be stars!
,[The three enter the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob hooks up the speaker set. Plankton is nowhere to be seen],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Starts out by acting all excited like a rock stars], All right! Squidward, are you ready?
,Squidward:, ,[makes a loud bass guitar strum], I'm ready!
,SpongeBob:, Okay! Patrick, are you ready? ,[Patrick answers by laughing while beating his belly], Plankton, are you ready? ,[Crickets are chirping in the background], Plankton? ,[Plankton is carrying a bottle containing the formula. SpongeBob gasps], PLANKTON! ,[The bottle is broken as SpongeBob says Plankton's name in the mic loudly. The formula is shown to the audience, but all of it is in gibberish],
,Plankton:, Uh… I'm ready?
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute… Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?
,Plankton:, What? No, I was in it for the music, man!
,[The camera changes to outside the Krusty Krab and twelve police cars circle around the Krusty Krab. The scene cuts back to the Bikini Bottom Jail. Plankton, in a caged box, sighs],
,Plankton:, Well, at least I'm back to my old cell.
,Police Officer:, Oh, no, you're not. We've got a special cell for you. ,[Frank moves a small painting out of the way, unlocks a safe, and both of them put Plankton in there],
,Plankton:, But I liked my old cell.
,Police Officer:, Then you're gonna love this one. ,[closes the cell],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Opens the small window on the other side of Plankton's cell, and only SpongeBob's eye is seen through], There's no time to waste, Plankton. ,[Plankton looks outside, then the scene cuts to the yard outside, with SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward being there], We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig. A one and a two…

,Fish 2:, ,[Turns into a jerk], Hey, I want to sing “Randolph the Red-Nosed Seahorse”!
,[They all continue to argue],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Driving away, unaware that they have been poisoned with Jerktonium], Great to see people so passionate about the holidays.
,Plankton:, ,[Emerges from the Chum Bucket on a unicycle], What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting.
,[Cut to a shot of a Christmas parade in town],
,SpongeBob:, Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy. ,[Singing], Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout “Hooray!”!

,Plankton:, Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy.
,[Cut to Plankton's lab],
,Karen:, Once again your master plan is fatally flawed. ,[She brings up a diagram], It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium.
,SpongeBob Diagram:, Dahahaha! That tickles.
,Plankton:, Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B. ,[He pulls a lever and a giant SpongeBob robot drops from the ceiling], Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen.

,Plankton:, Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!
,[The mail truck is still spinning out of control and finally comes to rest. The bound and gagged mailman escapes and jumps away],
,Patchy:, I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch. ,[He gets out of the truck and slips on the ice], Ow! ,[He notices the fork in the tire], Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire?
,[End of part one; now to part two with a scene of Potty and Patchy huddled around a fire],
,Patchy:, ,[Shivering] ,Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water or food or food for over 20 minutes. ,[Coughs], Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty? ,[He looks at Potty, imagining him as a plate of buffalo wings], With a side of blue cheese dressing. ,[He grabs a fork, licks his lips, and lunges at Potty who flies up and Patchy bites on the log Potty is sitting on],
,Potty:, Squawk! What are you doing?
,Patchy:, I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry!
,Potty:, It's okay, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you. ,[He imagines Patchy's head as a suet cake and licks his beak],
,Patchy:, Why are you looking at me like that, bird? ,[Potty pecks at his head], What are you doing?
,[Cut to SpongeBob's storyline; SpongeBob is riding the dispenser through Bikini Bottom and comes across the 3 carolers he first gave Plankton's fruitcake to],
,SpongeBob:, Merry Christmas, fellas!
,Bill:, Ah, go stuff a stocking!
,SpongeBob:, Gee. That wasn't very nice. ,[He drives past Mr. Krabs, who is mending the Krusty Krab sign], Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary!
,SpongeBob:, What's that all about? ,[He drives up to Patrick, who is setting another trap,] Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?
,Patrick:, I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob!, [He eats a slice of fruitcake], I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now.
,SpongeBob:, Yeesh, okay. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters.
,Patrick:, Nosybody. ,[He falls into his own trap] ,Yay, it works! Oh. Hello, big, striped shrimp. [,He screams as it attacks him],
,[The next morning, SpongeBob steps outside],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will.
,Johnny:, Merry Christmas, Frankie.
,Frankie:, Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny. ,[Throws a snowball in Johnny's face],
,SpongeBob:, More like ,bad, will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help. ,[He knocks on Squidward's door], Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[From inside], I'm not home!
,SpongeBob:, Oh gosh, what do I do now?
,Squidward:, Why don't you go bother Sandy?
,SpongeBob:, Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home. ,[He leaves, and ToyBob walks up to Squidward's house, pounding on the door],
,Squidward:, I said I'm not home! ,[ToyBob wrenches the door off its hinges], SpongeBob, give me back my door! ,[ToyBob smashes it over Squidward's head],
,[Cut to Sandy's treedome],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why.
,Sandy:, ,[Turns around and bares her teeth, scaring SpongeBob, except that she isn't a jerk after all], Why should I help all them jerks?
,SpongeBob:, Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem.
,Sandy:, Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts. ,[She throws one at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own. ,[He turns to leave and slips on a nut, accidentally throwing the fruitcake into Sandy's Christmas analyzer], Whoa!
,Sandy:, Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyzer! ,[An alarm sounds], Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake! ,[She looks at the reading and gasps] ,This is terrible!
,SpongeBob:, What is it, Sandy?
,Sandy:, The fruitcake is contaminated with jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?
,SpongeBob:, From Plankton, he baked it.
,Sandy:, You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,Sandy:, You're an idiot.
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,Sandy:, No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie.
,SpongeBob:, Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!
,Sandy:, ,[Pokes him], Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason it's not affecting you. ,[She puts a scanner in front of him] ,It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula. ,[She pulls a switch and a music score pops out], Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!
,SpongeBob:, Hmm… That's no formula! It's a song! ,[He hums it, and Sandy becomes her normal self], Sandy, The song is the antidote!
,[Cut to downtown Bikini Bottom, where people are still rioting],
,Fish 6:, Oh yeah? Well your fins are fat!
,SpongeBob:, Ahoy, everybody!
,[He clicks his fingers and mistletoe appears over the heads of the two fish he fed Plankton's fruitcake to, curing them of Jerktonium poisoning. He clicks again and a pile of presents appears, curing two other fish. A little boy begins to play Christmas baubles like bells],
,SpongeBob:, ♪Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! ,[Throws a snowball at Mr Krabs and cures him] ,Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas!,[Hands a gift to Pearl, who continues to pass it down a line, curing people as they receive it, except for Squidward, who is unaffected], When others are talking, never interrupt. Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up. It's the time for families and holly and turkey. 'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!♪

,Mr. Krabs:, You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now!
,[They all clear the way as Santa Claus' sleigh and reindeer land in front of the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, boy! Santa! You made it!
,Santa:, Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho! Cool your jets there, son. I'm afraid I'm the bearer of ,bad, tidings.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no!
,Santa:, Oh, ,yes,. It seems you're all on my naughty list this year.
,SpongeBob:, Naughty list?!
,Santa:, No buts about it. You've all been a bunch of ,jerks,.

,Santa:, I'm just as surprised as ,you,, but compared to the ,rest, of you, he's been a ,saint,.  ,[Hands him the Krabby Patty formula] ,Here you go, Sheldon, I believe ,this, is what you asked for.

,Santa:, On the contrary, SpongeBob, ,you're, the ,worst, of all. There you go, right now—wreaking ,havoc,!

,Plankton:, Uh-oh.
,ToyBob:, ,[Focuses on SpongeBob, Plankton and Santa] ,I am ready to destroy Christmas. ,[transforms into his mega mode], Destroy Santa.
,SpongeBob:, If you want Santa, you gotta get through me!
,Mega ToyBob:, Okey-dokey. ,[Karate chops SpongeBob],
,Santa:, Oh, my.
,SpongeBob:, Is that all you got?
,[Mega ToyBob picks him up and flings him far away and releases a flame],
,Santa:, I'm outta here. ,[He hides in the Krusty Krab, but ToyBob finds him and picks him up], You do realize ,this, counts as, ,naughty,.
,SpongeBob:, You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter! ,[Fires fruitcake at Mega ToyBob], Hot from the oven, full of lovin'! ,[Rushes back to rescue Santa] ,Hurry up, Santa, hop on!
,[Mega ToyBob shorts out and explodes],
,Santa:, Thanks again for saving my keister.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it was nothing.
,Santa:, You're ,clearly, a very ,good, lad, unlike the owner of that ,wind-up monstrosity,. ,[An elf hands him the wind-up key], What have we got there? ""If found, please return to the Chum Bucket""? Plankton!?
,Plankton:, Uh-oh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hand it over, Sheldon. Don't make it any worse. ,[Takes the Krabby Patty formula. Plankton gets flung at Santa's sleigh, and he splatters all over it. He falls off, leaving squish marks on the sleigh],
,Santa:, O.K., boys, let's give Plankton what he ,deserves,. ,[The elves pour coal onto Plankton], So long, kiddies! Ho-o-o-o, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! ,[He flies away as everyone [except Squidward] waves goodbye to him],

He stops just in time to see SpongeBob wearing his red swim suit and Patrick wearing a just light green swim suit and red swim cap pass by him. The scene follows Patrick and SpongeBob until they stop. They give each other excited faces and start laughing with excitement. They Run away from an oncoming tide. They chase the receding tide. They go back and forth two times. The scene zooms into show just their faces. They continue to laugh. The giant shadow of a giant wave emerges],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Uh-oh.
,[The scene pans out to show the giant wave. The two get submerged in the wave. The scene changes to the open lagoon. SpongeBob and Patrick's bottom half float into the scene. SpongeBob gets up and gasps. He turns Patrick right-side-up],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Do you know how to swim?
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Patrick:, Me neither.
,SpongeBob:, Hmm, I wonder why we're not sinking to the bottom of Goo Lagoon. ,[A big round purple object lifts Patrick into the air. Patrick screams], Patrick, you're floating!
,Patrick:, Oh. ,[another one lifts SpongeBob in the air], Hey, you're floating too! What happened?
,SpongeBob:, ,[He looks down at his object], These weird bubbles saved us.
,Patrick:, ,[He pokes on his bubble], It's all purple and sticky.
,SpongeBob:, ,[He sticks his hand on the bubble and stretches it a little], And it's really stretchy. It's some kind of goo bubble.
,Patrick:, ,[He smells the goo bubble], Well, the smell makes my nose tickle. ,[He sneezes which causes the bubble to bounce on the lagoon's surface. He giggles.], Hey, it bounces! 
,[SpongeBob and Patrick smile at each other signifying that that are thinking to do the same thing. SpongeBob and Patrick bounce on the lagoon's surface like they're playing on hopping balls while laughing. SpongeBob bounces above Nat, who is is a doughnut-shaped pool floaty that has red and white stripes on it. Nat sighs. Patrick bounces on him causing him to go under the lagoon's surface. He emerges through the floaty and gasps for ""air""],
,Patrick:, Sorry! 
,[The scene changes to show on a surfer, who is normally the lifeguard, wearing Patrick like pants surfing on a wave. SpongeBob goes through the top of the wave and hits him on the head. This causes him to lose his balance and wipe out. The surfer reaches the surface and gasps for ""air"". Patrick also bounces on him, causing him to go back under the surface of the lagoon. The scene changes to show a group of water ski acrobats and Thaddeus is driving the boat. The group consists of: on the bottom, Blue Fred, Sadie, and an orange fish; in the middle, Sandals and Nazz-Mimi; on the top, Dale, who is holding two red flags. Patrick comes and bounces on the group, knocking them over. The scene changes to show Plankton selling chum in a cart on the beach, while wearing a farmer's hat and a red bandanna],
,Plankton:, Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm, ,[He takes out a calculator with the number ""102682"" on it.], beach-goers should be famished ,[He throws the calculator behind him], and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people! ,[A pole destroys Plankton's chum cart and causes his outfit to fly away], Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood! 
,[The scene widens to show Squidward, wearing a blue swim suit, behind an orange beach chair putting up an orange and yellow umbrella, which was the thing that crushed Plankton's cart],
,Squidward:, ,[opens his umbrella], Ah, a beautiful day beachside. I couldn't think of a thing that could ruin this. ,[lays down on his chair],
,Plankton:, I could think of a few.
,Squidward:, ,[puts tanning lotion on his nose and lays down to tan with his tanning mirror. A big shadow appears above Squidward], Hey, you're blocking my light. ,[SpongeBob appears from the sky, laughing, and crashes into Squidward with his goo bubble. This causes Squidward to go under the sand and to destroy both the umbrella and the chair. Squidward pops out of the sand], SpongeBob. ,[Another shadow appear and Patrick's laughter is heard. Patrick appears and also crashes onto Squidward, who screams, with his goo bubble. Again, Squidward goes under the sand. Squidward pops out of the sand with his tanning mirrors stuck to his head like a flower's petals. Plankton walks up to Squidward],
,Plankton:, Ah, sweet karma. It can come from the most boneheaded of places. ,[He notices SpongeBob and Patrick bouncing on their goo bubbles while laughing], Wait a second. What are those bouncing blobs of goo?
,Squidward:, ,[growls], I don't know and I don't care! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to bounce and laugh on their goo bubbles until Squidward steps in front of them], Hold it! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick stop bouncing and their bubble drop to the ground], What I want to know is why you two have ruined my attempts of having an even tan!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sorry, Squidward. We're riding on these cool ,[He steps off the bubble and lifts it], goo bubbles. They're floating out of Goo Lagoon. 
,[A strange robot comes out of the water and everyone screams and runs away in horror, except for SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward who are too shocked to move. The robot opens itself revealing that it was just a suit controlled by Sandy.],
,Sandy:, Stop! ,[She exits the suit], Those bubbles are dangerous!
,Plankton:, Dangerous?
,SpongeBob:, ,[The scene changes to show Squidward, Patrick and SpongeBob. Patrick and SpongeBob are holding their bubble separately], Fascinating. Tell us more.
,Patrick:, Yeah, but with visual aids.
,Sandy:, O-kay... ,[pushes a button on the front of her suit that opens up a projection screen while her tail holds a projector. The projection says ""DANGER"" (in red letters) ""BENEATH THE SEA FLOOR"" (in gold letters). The visual is of a normal undersea background], My scientific investigation has ,[the camera cuts to the projection screen], revealed that deep beneath the lagoon floor is a volcanic pocket of super goo. ,[The visual changes to show 5 layers: the top is the lagoon, the second is an light orange straight section that is probably the floor of the lagoon, the third is a red straight section that might be lava, the fourth section is straight and light brown and slightly smaller than the second layer, the fifth layer is a blackish straight layer that is about double the size of the third layer. The fifth layer also contains a purple section in the middle that has the words ""SUPER GOO"" in gold letters. The visual aid then shows a zig-zag section that goes from the super goo section all the way to the top of the second layer/bottom of the lagoon], A crack has formed releasing bubbles of the goo to the surface which are toxic and very unstable.,[The visual aid changes to show the crack at the bottom of the lagoon floor releasing super goo that forms a bubble. The bubble starts to morph and then it pops all over the visual aid.], At any moment, it could lose its integrity and boom! It'll explode!
,[The scene changes to show Plankton next to a red bucket with a button panel on it.],
,Plankton:, That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone. ,[lifts the panel's cover and pushes a red button on the bucket and door opens. The exterior is barely shown, but of what is shown, it looks similar to the Chum Bucket's lab interior. He goes inside and the door closes. The bucket sinks into the sand and a purple and light purple clam-shaped sub flies out and dives into the lagoon.],
,[The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Patrick holding their goo bubbles separately.],
,SpongeBob:, It's so gooey. ,[stretches the goo bubble],
,Patrick:, ,[shoves the goo bubble into his mouth; muffled], I can fit it in my mouth. Oh, it tastes like licorice.
,Squidward:, ,[off-screen], You idiots! ,[the scene widens to show him], That goo is dangerous! Weren't you two morons listening?
,Patrick:, ,[muffled], No, not really. I drifted off.
,SpongeBob:, But just look at all the cool stuff it can do. ,[stretches the goo bubble and makes it into a form of a top hat], You can make a hat. ,[put it on his head and spreads the goo around his face], Or a beard.
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick wears the goo bubble on his head in a Elvis Presley hairstyle], Or an awesome toupée.
,Squidward:, Toupée? You mean hair? ,[grabs a goo bubble that is floating towards him and put it on his head. Then, he stretches it and makes it into hair], How do I look?
,Sandy:, What is wrong with you people?! That goo can destroy everything!
,Patrick:, ,[SpongeBob and his goo bubble are stuck on right side of Patrick's head], Seems safe to me.
,Sandy:, That's what they said about microwave ovens, dry cleaning, and corn dogs!
,[The scene widens to show Squidward messing with his ""hair"" and Patrick and SpongeBob sitting on their bubbles],
,SpongeBob:, See you later, Sandy.
,Patrick:, Yeah, these goo bubbles won't bounce themselves. 
,[Patrick and SpongeBob bounce away on their goo bubbles while Squidward continues to mess with his ""hair""],
,Sandy:, You have been warned! 
,[The bubble transition appears and the scene changes to show Sandals playing volleyball with Pilar. Pilar hits the ball too hard, it flies into the lagoon],
,Sandals:, Oh, man, where will we get another ball?
,[The Scene widens to show SpongeBob bouncing on his bubble while holding a smaller goo bubble],
,SpongeBob:, Why not try a goo bubble? ,[He gives them the smaller goo bubble. He bounces away],
,Pilar:, Thanks. ,[the goo sticks to his fin], Hey, it sticks like glue! Go long! ,[Sandals runs off as Pilar throws the goo bubble. But since it was stuck to his fin, it sends him flying into the lagoon. He pops out], Awesome! I still got it! I wish I could swim. ,[sinks back in],
,Thaddeus:, ,[wipes his head], It's so hot. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick arrive, each on their goo bubble, and Patrick makes a beach umbrella out of a passing goo bubble that is smaller than then ones the two are sitting on], Oh, it's so cooling. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick bounce off], Thanks, goo!
,Squidward:, Thanks, goo!
,Pilar:, ,[under the lagoon], Thanks, goo!
,Tommy, Sadie, Orange fish from earlier, Billy, Nazz-Mimi, and Brown girl fish:, Thanks, goo!
,[The scene widens to show that at least the last one was part of a newscast. Johnny is seen on the news anchor set on a TV screen],
,Johnny Erain:, And now we go to Perch Perkins ,[The image of the Bikini Bottomites goes away and is replaced by Perch Perkins in front of some passing goo bubble while light green letters in the upper-left corner of the screen that read ""LIVE"" are shown], at the scene!
,[The scene zooms into the image of Perch Perkins and now fills the whole screen],
,Perch Perkins:, That's right! Perch Perkins here at Goo Lagoon, bringing you the latest on this Super Goo event. ,[walks up to SpongeBob], What do you think of Super Goo, young man?
,SpongeBob:, ,[He looks nervous for a second and remains silent for a moment until he looks at the camera. He smiles], I'm on TV!
,Perch Perkins:, ,[walks up to Patrick], And you, sir, what's your opinion? ,[Patrick doesn't say anything], Uh, sir?
,Patrick:, ,[grabs Perch's suit], It's awesome.
,Perch Perkins:, ,[chuckles nervously], That's great. Let's get some comments from some other beach goers. ,[Sandy runs up and grabs the microphone],
,Sandy:, I have a comment: Super Goo is evil! ,[eye twitches], Stay in your homes!
,Perch Perkins:, ,[angrily grabs his microphone back from Sandy], Yes, siree. The goo bubbles certainly are getting folks excited.
,[The ""LIVE"" in the corner goes away],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[bouncing on their goo bubbles], We sure are excited! ,[laugh],
,[The bubble transition appears and the scene changes to show Plankton's clam-shaped sub in the depth of the lagoon surrounded by goo bubbles. The scene changes to Plankton on the interior. He is sitting on reddish brown seat and holding a yoke with a red button and a green button on it],
,Plankton:, ,[continues his search for the crack formed from the super goo under the lagoon. He lets go of the yoke], I can't find this thing anywhere. ,[pulls out his binoculars and looks to the left of the vehicle], Come on, now. Think, Plankton. ,[he looks up], If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be? ,[he goes back to the left],
,Karen:, ,[pops up], Sheldon, this ship wasn't designed to reach these depths.
,Plankton:, That's great, sweetheart.
,Karen:, If you continue this search much longer, your power supply will deplete and you'll sink.
,Plankton:, All right, Karen. I'll make sure I write that down in my book, titled, ,Insignificant Things My Wife Told Me.,
,Karen:, Whatever. Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon. It's your funeral.
,Plankton:, What did you say?
,Karen:, I said, ""Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon.""
,Plankton:, That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship. ,[Karen cuts the power and the ship starts sinking], Yes! ,[laughs evilly as his ship continues to sink until it finds the crack where the goo bubbles are coming from], Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power. ,[Karen restarts the ship], With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense. ,[the ship lands into the crack as Plankton laughs evilly. Plankton pushes the button and the ship widens the crack], Yes! Yes! Bubble forth, my gooey wrath! ,[the lagoon floor begins to shake], And now to get the ding-dang out of here! ,[Plankton makes his getaway in his escape pod while the remains of his ship get swallowed up by the massive purple goo rising from the crack],
,SpongeBob:, Look! ,[a giant purple goo bubble forms out of the water], Giant goo bubble! ,[Sandy pops out from the sand under SpongeBob],
,Sandy:, See, I told ya! ,[breaths crazily], Run for your lives!
,Patrick:, Sandy's really getting out of hand. ,[cuts to black screen],
,Perch Perkins:, This is Perch Perkins reporting live from Goo Lagoon where I'm standing in front of what appears to be some sort of gigantic gooey bubble rising out of the water into the water. With me is Sandy Cheeks. Miss Cheeks, as Bikini Bottom's resident know-it-all, we look to you for answers. Who, what, how, why, when?
,Sandy:, Well, Perch, I won't really know anything until I run some tests but I can tell you it's pretty serious. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get going. ,[reveals that Perch is sitting in the boat with her along with SpongeBob and Patrick],
,Perch Perkins:, Oh, yes. Of course. ,[Perch jumps into the water and pops up while his microphone is short circuiting], This is Perch Perkins and I'm soaking wet. Back to you.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, it's so big!
,Sandy:, That there is a Texas-sized bubble! ,[picks up one of the oars], First, we'll check its tensile strength. ,[taps on the bubble a few times], Tight as a drum.
,Patrick:, ,[takes the oar from Sandy], Oh, I want to play the drum! ,[attempts to hit it until Sandy grabs the oar],
,Sandy:, No, Patrick, don't! That thing's volatile! There's no telling what kind of damage it'll cause if it pops!
,Patrick:, Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways. ,[jumps into the bubble but bounces back causing him to crash into SpongeBob and fall in the water. Water splashes on Sandy's helmet],
,Sandy:, ,[pulls them out and back into the boat], Come on, guys. We still have more tests to perform. I need a sample. Be a darling and hand me that there bucket. ,[SpongeBob gets up and has a bucket stuck on his bottom. Patrick giggles at that as Sandy takes the bucket and grabs a bit of goo from the bubble], Ok, SpongeBob, put a little bit of that gloop into this analyzer. ,[SpongeBob pours the goo in the mouth of Sandy's analyzer. The analyzer scans the goo but goes haywire as a paper spits out], This is worse than I thought.
,SpongeBob:, Look, Sandy. ,[makes a painting of Sandy out of goo with Patrick and giggles with him],
,Sandy:, How many times do I have to tell you that stuff's dangerous? Now, how are y'all gonna clean that gunk off?
,SpongeBob:, ,[both SpongeBob and Patrick's hand are covered with goo], Oh, yeah. Gross. Good thing I keep a spare set of hands. ,[two extra hands pop out of his head, takes off the goo stained hands off, and throws them in the water],
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah! ,[Patrick rips his arm off but nothing happens],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, I have a better idea. ,[a bottle of bubbles pop out of his head and he mixes the soap with its wand], Hold out your hands. ,[blows bubbles on Patrick's hands and the bubbles clean the goo off],
,Patrick:, Oh, they shine!
,Sandy:, Well, it seems to have stabilized. As long as it doesn't get any bigger, there's not too much to worry about. ,[ground rumbles], That ain't good. ,[the force of the rumble causes a tidal wave which sends SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy flying while screaming and crashing onto the beach],
,Perch Perkins:, So, Miss Cheeks, what's the prognosis?
,Sandy:, Well, Perch, it's my considered opinion that now would be a good time to-- ,[ground rumbles], --run like heck! ,[everyone runs and screams],
,Perch Perkins:, ,[on tv], Well, there you have it. This is Perch Perkins about to be swallowed by a giant wave. ,[the wave crashes onto Perch and the TV goes into color bars screen. Everyone at Goo Lagoon is running for their lives and screaming as the giant goo bubble rolls on the beach.],
,Patrick:, ,[runs to an outhouse], I'll catch up! I've gotta use the can! ,[close the door until the giant goo bubble rolls onto it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[trips over a rock], Whoa! ,[lands on his head in the sand and Sandy pulls him out. The giant goo bubble almost rolls over SpongeBob and Sandy and begins to float in the air above them],
,Sandy:, Phew, that was a close one.
,Patrick:, Help, help! Help! ,[punches through the door], I'm out of toilet paper in here! ,[the outhouse begins to slide off],
,SpongeBob:, Look out! ,[SpongeBob and Sandy run as the outhouse crashes onto the ground. Patrick hangs on for his life but he begins to slip while some of the goo sticks on him. He screams. SpongeBob is reaching out for Patrick while Sandy is carrying him by the feet], Hang on, buddy! Just a little bit more! ,[grabs Patrick by his foot], Gotcha! ,[tries to pull him down but loses his grip], I don't gotcha! Whoa! ,[SpongeBob and Sandy fall over as Patrick, who is still stuck on the goo, stretches up as the goo detaches causing him to fall right on top of the goo bubble],
,Patrick:, Help! ,[sobs as the goo bubble drifts away],
,SpongeBob:, Now what do we do?
,Sandy:, We need to get to my submarine! Fast! ,[Squidward is seen riding on his recumbent bicycle until Sandy grabs him be the arms], Squidward, it's an emergency! I'm gonna need your bike! ,[Sandy lifts Squidward off his bike and gets on], Hop on, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob gets on and rides for a few seconds to Sandy's treedome. They get off and run inside],
,Squidward:, Sheesh, you'd think the sky was falling. ,[goo then splatters on top of Squidward], I am going to learn to keep my big mouth shut. ,[the goo bubble floats by the treedome as Patrick continues to scream until he begins to play with the goo. He then make a goo sculpture of SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, Howdy, SpongeBlob! I'm so glad you could ,stick, around. ,[giggles], Glad. ,[SpongeBob and Sandy arrive in a submarine],
,Sandy:, ,[through her communicator], Hold on, Patrick! We're here to rescue you!
,Patrick:, Oh, go rescue somebody else. Can't you see I'm playing with my friend, SpongeBlob? ,[SpongeBob and Sandy look at each other in confusion. They fly above Patrick and release a grappling hook], Don't worry. I'll never leave you. ,[the hook grabs Patrick's head], Huh? ,[the hook pulls Patrick off the goo], No...! Good-bye, SpongeBlob! ,[Patrick gets pulled safely into the submarine as the hook left a dent on his head], Hi, SpongeBob! Hi, Sandy! ,[the goo bubble flies towards Bikini Bottom],
,SpongeBob:, So what do we do now, Sandy? That thing is headed straight for downtown Bikini Bottom.
,Sandy:, If that thing pops, we can kiss our beautiful town goodbye! ,[the townspeople takes Sandy's words too literally and starts to kiss the streets and the buildings and say goodbye to them. The goo bubble continues to fly above the city and rains goo on the townspeople and buildings. Everyone starts screaming. The bubble bends two skyscrapers. Cuts to the Bikini Bottom City Hall where a bride and a groom are getting married at the steps and the front door while everyone is cheering. A pile of goo splatters on top of the groom],
,Groom:, Help me, my beloved.
,Bride:, Don't touch me, you disgusting freak! ,[a drop of goo stains her wedding dress and she cries], My dress is ruined! ,[Sandy's sub flies underneath the bubble as it splatters goo on Nancy Suzy-Fish after she gasps],
,Nancy's baby:, ,[giggles], Mommy goopy! ,[goo splatters on Nancy's baby. Nancy runs away screaming with her baby while Tyler takes cover in a nearby trashcan. Once its safe, he sighs and climbs out covered in filth. The bubble continues to fly but this time towards the statue of King Neptune],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no! It's headed right for Neptune's trident!
,Sandy:, I was afraid it might come to this. In order to save the city, we must destroy public property. ,[activates missiles at the bottom of her sub],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Sandy, why do you have missiles in your sub?
,Sandy:, You know, in case I get stuck in traffic. Here goes! ,[pushes button and launches the missiles. The missiles make a direct hit on the statue, but they instead make it into a skeleton form], Darn it! ,[the goo bubble approaches and SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick scream. However, the bubble flies above the statue], Huh? What the--?
,SpongeBob:, That's weird. It's like that bubble has a mind of its own.
,Sandy:, Or the mind of someone else. Look! ,[it is revealed that Plankton has been moving the bubble by pushing it from behind while he is inside the escape pod. He sighs], Plankton! I knew it!
,Plankton:, Yeah, it's me.
,Sandy:, What are y'all up to this time?
,Plankton:, Well, that's for me to know and for you to clam up!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Rude!
,Plankton:, Let's just say I've got big plans for this little bubble. ,[laughs evilly as SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick stare at him in disgust], Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go. ,[proceeds in pushing the goo bubble. SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick pursue him until he activates a continuous track on his escape pod. They continue to chase him around the bubble until Plankton laughs and speeds up],
,Sandy:, Dang it! We'll never catch him at this rate!
,Plankton:, Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate! ,[yelps as he sees Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick coming towards him at the front],
,Sandy:, ,[comes out of her sub], Oh, no, you don't! ,[throws a lasso on Plankton's pod and ties the rope on the hook], Come here, you little varmint! You stay right there! Yippee! We got him now! ,[Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick jump out and run towards him],
,Plankton:, That's right, come to Papa.
,Sandy:, When we get you out of there, you've got some explaining to do!
,Patrick:, ,[runs past SpongeBlob], Hey again, SpongeBlob!
,Sandy:, We've got you surrounded, Plankton! Now, come out with your antenna in the air!
,Plankton:, Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second-- ,[pushes a red button], No, you don't! ,[Plankton's pod flies off],
,Sandy:, Retreat! Retreat!
,Plankton:, Aw, don't go so soon. ,[pushes a yellow button. The pod activates a giant plug], I hope you brought your dancing shoes! ,[the plug stabs on the bubble cornering SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy], 'Cause it's time to do the electric goo-boogaloo! ,[pushes a green button and the plug electrocutes SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick which causes the townspeople below to scream in fear as Plankton laughs evilly. SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy are fried and Plankton pushes them off with the wind from his pod's rudder. As they fall, he continues to push the bubble. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy fall and scream until they crash to the ground],
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick and Sandy are shown to be unharmed from the impact of the fall], Good thing we landed on SpongeBob. ,[it reveals that SpongeBob's spongy body saved them but SpongeBob is squashed under them],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, good thing. ,[Sandy jumps off],
,Sandy:, Plankton, you creepy bacteria! Give me back my sub! ,[Plankton throws Sandy's sub at them as it crashes to the ground. Sandy gasps], My sub!
,SpongeBob:, There, there Sandy.
,Patrick:, Plankton, you're-- you're a big meanie-weenie! You won't be such a tough guy without that big old bubble!
,SpongeBob:, Tough guy? Bubble? Patrick! Eureka! Inspiration!
,Patrick:, Really? ,[smells his armpit], Do I need deodorant?
,SpongeBob:, No, but you're close. What we need is ,[pulls out his bubble bottle from his head], liquid soap. It's time to fight bubble with bubble!
,Patrick:, ,[scoffs], Bubbles. That's your answer for everything. ,[cuts to the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thank you, come again! ,[goo splatters onto Mr. Krabs' eyes], Hey, who turned out the lights? ,[wipes off the goo and looks up to see the giant goo bubble in front of his restaurant],
,Plankton:, Hello, down there, Krabs! Look, I brought you a pretty balloon! And in return, you can give me the Krabby Patty secret formula!
,Mr. Krabs:, Why in the world would I want to do that?
,Plankton:, Cause if you don't, ,[his pod pulls out a needle], I'm gonna pop this disgusting thing and destroy Bikini Bottom! ,[then his pod holds out his computer with the picture of the Krusty Krab and Bikini Bottom on it], As you can see, I projected the blast radius of this goo-bomic balloon and it's gonna cover pretty much everything in town.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yeah? Well, I can't see nothing from down here!
,Plankton:, Oh, yeah? Well, look again, you dingus! ,[throws his computer down at Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, I won't be blackmailed! There's no way I'm giving you me secret formula!
,Plankton:, You heard him, Bikini Bottom! It's time to kiss clean goodbye! ,[prepares to pop the goo bubble as he laughs evilly, but is stopped by SpongeBob's voice],
,SpongeBob:, ,[standing on the Krusty Krab sign], Hey, you! Yeah, you! Hold it right there, mister!
,Plankton:, Eh, not again.
,SpongeBob:, Prepare to meet your match, you big, bubble bully! ,[Sandy is standing on the bubble bottle and stirs the liquid soap with a giant bubble wand],
,Plankton:, ,[his pod puts its needle away on its head], Well, this is interesting. Let's see where it goes.
,Sandy:, Thank Neptune for the Barg'N-Mart buck discount! ,[gives SpongeBob the giant bubble wand],
,SpongeBob:, Here goes. ,[jumps off the sign], Geroni-blow! ,[the bubble wand creates a big bubble which takes the form of a bubble giant], Pretty slick, huh? Get him! ,[the bubble giant runs towards Plankton],
,Plankton:, ,[gasps], Uh-oh.
,Patrick:, ,[slides down the pole], Whoo! ,[laughs], Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser! ,[runs up in the middle of the confrontation], Whoo! ,[laughs], You're the man! Yay! ,[the bubble giant steps on Patrick's pointy head and begins to deflate and fly around],
,Plankton:, Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah! ,[grabs the needle and proceeds but the deflating bubble giant flies under and lifts the goo bubble higher and higher],
,SpongeBob:, There goes a real hero. He gave his life so we could stay clean. ,[the bubble giant lifts the goo bubble so high that it flies out of the ocean and into outer space. The bubble giant begins to evaporate as Plankton's face gets distorted a little while he grunts until he reaches space. The goo bubble bounces on the moon and hurdles back to Earth and into the ocean], Oh, no, he's coming back!
,Sandy:, And he's headin' right for us! ,[Plankton parachutes the bubble safely and slowly to the ground. The townspeople flee as SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs scream until the bubble stops on top of them],
,Plankton:, That's it, no more messing around! Give me that formula or I'll destroy this stinkin' town! ,[hold out the needle],
,Mr. Krabs:, But I don't wanna!
,Nat Peterson:, You'd better do what he says or we'll tear your restaurant apart and give it to him ourselves!
,Bill:, Yeah!
,Martha Smith:, I just washed my car!
,Bill:, Yeah!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[growls], Ok, I'll do it.
,Bill:, Yeah! ,[Martha and Nat look at him strangely as Mr. Krabs goes into his restaurant and gets the bottle containing the secret formula],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hands Plankton the bottle], Here. I hope you choke on it.
,Plankton:, ,[retrieves the formula from Mr. Krabs and opens his window], I can't believe it! After all these years, it's mine! ,[cries tears of joy and wipes a tear away], I'm so happy, I could just burst! This bubble that is! ,[everyone gasps and Plankton ruthlessly pops the bubble and the town is covered in purple goo as he laughs evilly. Everyone including SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs are covered in goo],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that dirty little double-timer!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry. He's about to get what's coming to him.
,Plankton:, ,[flies his pod and uses the windshield wipers to clean the goo off the window], Now to see what's inside a Krabby Patty! ""Just one ingredient:..."" ,[rolls down the paper as he continues to read only to find that there is a TNT dynamite attached to it], Darn it, Krabs! ,[the dynamite explodes inside the pod and it crash lands on the roof of the Chum Bucket], Ow. ,[Mr. Krabs laughs at Plankton's failure with joy],
,Sandy:, ,[annoyed], Well, I don't see what you're so gull darn happy about! This is a catastrophe!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, darlin', it's like this: Where you see disaster, I see dollar signs. So, SpongeBob, you got any of that bubble soap left? ,[cuts to a line of people who are waiting to get cleaned up], Please have your money ready! ,[Nat gives Mr. Krabs his money], Thank you! ,[opens up his cashier], Right this way. ,[Nat walks up and gets picked up by the bubble giant. The giant eats Nat and swirls him around and around inside until it spits him out with its foot. Nat is now all sparkly clean. The bubble giant then picks up Martha and gets cleaned as well],

"SpongeBob:, ♪Mop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!♪
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! ,[Frank comes in and brings him a dollar], Why don't you mop your way over the kitchen. ,[points at Frank], We need another Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing. ,[SpongeBob walks to make a Krabby Patty. He puts a patty in a half made Krabby Patty and he puts too much mustard on it. Mr. Krabs opens the hot shelter and smells he that he put on too much mustard],
,Mr. Krabs:, What's that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts on the last bun], Perfection. ,[Mr. Krabs walks to see SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't think so. ,[grabs the Krabby Patty and sees too much mustard. Mr. Krabs gets angry at SpongeBob], You used too much mustard!
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs I...
,Mr. Krabs:, You obviously you didn't use your hydraulic mustard gauge. ,[Mr. Krabs uses a spoon and scoops some mustard. The spoon reads 101%. Mr Krabs gasps in shock], You think mustard grows from seeds? ,[throws the spoon and Krabby Patty away], Oh, at this rate, I'll be broke in ,[types the list], 411 years!
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Mr. Krabs:, Your skills are rusty, you're not your usual sharp self! Did you have breakfast this morning?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a Neptune muffin.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm... well what about sleep, young man. Did you get enough sleep?
,SpongeBob:, I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looks at SpongeBob], That's it! ,[pokes SpongeBob's body], You're an insomniac!
,SpongeBob:, An insomni-wha?
,Mr. Krabs:, You're a person who can't sleep and if you can't get enough sleep, your mind starts to go! ,[SpongeBob is surprised], Here. ,[Gives SpongeBob the spatula and pushes him to the grill], Come on, now, cook! ,[SpongeBob starts to flip patties. He pauses and glances at Mr. Krabs before flipping the patty. Mr. Krabs stops him], Ha! Ha ha! I knew it! You lifted a patty from one side, instead of straight up! What are you trying to do, sabotage me?! ,[takes the spatula and shoves him outside], Now you go home and get some rest!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, but sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab.
,Mr. Krabs:, Miss work? If you keep making mistakes like that, boyo, there will be no Krusty Krab!
,SpongeBob:, No Krusty Krab?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right! ,[points at the road], Now, get!
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks down the road], Yes, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Come back tomorrow after a good night's sleep! ,[Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple],
,SpongeBob:, I just don't get it Gary, I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?
,Gary:, ,[Chews his snail food],
,SpongeBob:, Well I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again. I am going straight to bed! [Cut to SpongeBob's bed.
,SpongeBob:, This pillow is hard as a rock! What to do?
,Gary:, Meow meow meow meow.
,SpongeBob:, You're right Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep! Now, that should do the trick!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Milk pours out of SpongeBob's holes], Boy, it sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. C'mon SpongeBob, you can do this. 4 hours 59 minutes 50 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds! ,[SpongeBob throws the clock away], What if I don't get to sleep at all? ,[in thoughts], Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right! ,[Camera goes on SpongeBob's eyes], I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do? (speaking) I need some help. ,[SpongeBob runs to Patrick's], Patrick, Patrick, wake up. ,[SpongeBob pulls Patrick up],
,Patrick:, Uh huh. ,[SpongeBob is speaking gibberish], Mmmm, sponge cake. ,[Chews on SpongeBob's hand],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yuck! Never mind that Patrick! I need your help! Desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!
,Patrick:, Say no more buddy, I know just the thing! ,[Takes a deep breath, blows off the sand, and grabs a book], Get comfy!
,SpongeBob:, Oh boy! A bedtime story! ,[Pulls up the sand into a pillow and lays down],
,Patrick:, Okay. Once upon a time there was a sleepy little boy.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, yay!
,Patrick:, The sleepy boy was the sleepiest boy in all the kingdom!
,SpongeBob:, Mm, sounds like me.
,Patrick:, One night, he nestled into bed for a long slumber.
,SpongeBob:, Slumber!
,Patrick:, And Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king, sprinkled him with mystical sleepy dust.
,SpongeBob:, Aw, thank you Sir Cecil.
,Patrick:, He couldn't have been cozier. When, without warning, an excitable sea troll burst through the window. ""Wakey wakey sleepy doo!"" he bellowed. Then suddenly he was whisked away by eagle-winged mollusks into the night sky!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?
,Patrick:, It's called ,The Land of Perpetual Excitement,. You know, it's a ""get out of bed"" story!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep.
,Patrick:, Oh. ,[Throws the book on SpongeBob's nose], Right. Oh I know! I'll sing you a lullaby from my childhood! ""Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
,SpongeBob:, Um, Patrick, that's...
,Patrick:, Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, be active! Get up, be active!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this isn't...
,Patrick:, Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
,SpongeBob:, That's a catchy bit...
,Patrick:, Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
,SpongeBob:, That's an excellent number, but...
,Patrick:, Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
,SpongeBob:, ,[yelling], Patrick! This isn't helping either!
,Patrick:, Well, what-what abou- well, I don't know what you want from me. It's not like I have a magic wand to wave. ,[Gets magic tools], Or do I...
,SpongeBob:, Oh, barnacles.
,Patrick:, Hocus, pocus!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, get serious please!
,Patrick:, Abra zeptabra!
,SpongeBob:, I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy. 'Kay?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I see you're serious about this now. I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna let you in on a little family secret. Old grandma suffered from severe toe barnacles.
,SpongeBob:, Blech!
,Patrick:, And she invented the secret elixir for just such an emergency. Drink up.
,SpongeBob:, Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-
,Patrick:, Drink it!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, That wasn't too bad. What was it?
,Patrick:, Coffee.
,SpongeBob:, C-C-C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to ,go to sleep,!
,Patrick:, Oops..
,SpongeBob:, Uh oh.. feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding... ,[Legs start to run by themselves], Uh oh. ,[Starts to fly around and then breaks Patrick's rock], N-no! No stop! We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain.
,Sea troll:, Wakey Wakey Sleepy Doo!
,SpongeBob:, Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob.
,Warm milk:, SpongeBob, Why did you drink me?
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry Mr. warm milk, you just tasted so good. ,[Shakes head], Shoo! That billboard is definitely not talking to you.
,Warm Milk:, Why SpongeBob, why?
,Mustard Krabs:, Stop wasting all me mustard, boyo!
,[SpongeBob notices a giant Mr. Krabs with mustard spouts for eye stalks and runs],
,Mustard Krabs:, Me profits! Me profits!
,[The mustard gets in SpongeBob's way and he backs up and knocks over mustard barrels],
,Squidwards:, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Mr. Krabs is going to be upset! Ha, ha, ha, ha! ,[Drown SpongeBob in the mustard. A seagull takes SpongeBob and takes him to a giant Patrick],
,Patrick:, Sponge cake!
,[SpongeBob gets eaten by Patrick and breaks a bed when he lands],
,SpongeBob:, What's this? Another vision? ,[sees what looks like the sun starting to rise], Oh why, why? Please, please, please let me sleep for just 5 minutes!
,Sir Cecil:, Do not despair, my child.
,SpongeBob:, Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king!?
,Sir Cecil:, Just close your eyes and slumber. With some magic dust! ,[Picks up the dust and tosses it on SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Hm.. it's getting all sleepish around here. ,[Goes back into reality], Oh, thank you Sir Cecil. Hmm? Hey, looks like I finally got some shut-eye. Now to prepare for work. ,[Puts hat in a hole], Perfect. ,[Leaves], Bye, Gary. ,[Goes to the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Boyo...? ,[Snaps his claw. SpongeBob wakes up],

,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Huh? Y-Yes... SpongeBob reporting for sleepy and tired.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ew! You're stinking like Davy Jones' locker! You sure you didn't forget something, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Forget..? Oh, right, right, Mr. Krabs. How could I be so forgetful?
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh, that's my boy. ,[Sees SpongeBob], What the barnacles?!
,[SpongeBob washes his hands with the mustard dispenser],
,SpongeBob:, Employees must wash their hands before cooking. ,[He smears mustard on his face], Oh, that's nice...
,Mr. Krabs:, That ain't the sink, kiddo! ,[SpongeBob gets into the mustard barrel],
,SpongeBob:, I know I know, I just need a quiet place... to nap.
,Mr. Krabs:, Me mustard! ,[Pulls SpongeBob out of the barrel], You didn't heed my words, did ya? You couldn't be bothered to get some shut eye, could ya?
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry Mr. Krabs! I tried, I really tried! But my insomnia got the best of me! ,[SpongeBob starts to cry tears of mustard],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now he's crying away me mustard. That's enough boy! Me profits! ,[Mr. Krabs is surprised], Huh? Your crying the perfect amount! Hold it boyo, you're a natural born mustard dispenser!
,SpongeBob:, Is that a good thing?

,[Squidward comes out carrying a bag of trash and goes to put it near the curb. Patrick waves at Squidward in a goofy fashion.],
,Squidward:, Yuck.
,[Patrick points on the pitcher and Squidward growls angrily. Patrick drinks the water and eats the glass.],
,Squidward:, ,[groans], What are you doing out here in the daylight? You should be hidden under your rock like the hideous freak you are. Do you even have a license to sell...,[notices the glasses of water], just what are you selling?
,Patrick:, ,[yells through megaphone], Lemonade!
,Squidward:, ,[pulls his nose and eyes back out from his head], Thanks for reminding me why I hate you. Lemonade? I don't see any lemons.
,Patrick:, ,[silent], I need lemons?
,Squidward:, ,[takes out a rotten lemon and throws it in Patrick's eye], Here. Don't say I never gave you anything. ,[Patrick's eye burns], Sorry it's a little bruised. ,[laughs],
,[Patrick lifts up his left arm, pulls out a bandage from his armpit and puts it on the rotten lemon.],
,Patrick:, All better. ,[puts the rotten lemon in the pitcher full of water],
,Squidward:, Yuck.
,[The scene changes to Squidward shaving the hair out of his nostrils with the razor. Patrick is still sitting outside at his lemonade stand with the rotten lemon in the pitcher.],
,Patrick:, ,[yells through two megaphones], Lemonade!
,[Patrick's loud outburst startles Squidward. The razor buzzes around in his nostrils and Squidward screams in all directions of his bathroom. The plug comes out and Squidward falls on the floor. Outside, Cara drinks the pitcher of Patrick's ""lemonade"".],
,Cara:, ,[after drinking the pitcher], Ahh! Thanks, buddy. I was thirsty. ,[gags and sticks his tongue out with the bandage on it],
,Patrick:, Oh! ,[removes the bandage from Cara's tongue],
,Cara:, Huh?
,Patrick:, ,[puts the bandage back on his armpit], Sorry, that's not included.
,Cara:, ,[gags], I'm gonna be sick! Where can I go? ,[covers his mouth],
,Patrick:, I always go in there.
,[Cara runs up to the front door, opens it and throws up inside Squidward's house. Cara then closes the door and leaves. Squidward comes out, slipping onto the path of his front door. He growls angrily and stomps over to Patrick, who is holding a firetruck toy.],
,Squidward:, What are you doing?
,Patrick:, Oh, I ran out of lemons, so I'm squeezing this.
,Squidward:, That won't work!
,[Patrick squeezes the red paint out from the firetruck toy.],
,Squidward:, Hmm? Wha...
,Patrick:, It could use more fire hose.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sneaks up behind Squidward and screams through megaphone], One fire truck lemonade!
,[Squidward screams and sprays ink out from his nose into the pitcher. Squidward panics and rushes into his house. SpongeBob pulls the megaphone off his face and Patrick gives him a cup of Squidward's ink.],
,Patrick:, Here you go.

,Lady:, Hello! What are you selling?
,Patrick:, ,[yells through megaphone], Lemonade!
,SpongeBob:, ,[yells through megaphone], Black lemonade!

,Lady:, ,[yells through megaphone], Black lemonade! A unique taste sensation! I'll have another. ,[slurps],
,[Patrick goes to give some more to the lady, but the pitcher is empty.],
,Patrick:, Huh? SpongeBob, cover for me while I go get some more.

,Patrick:, Hi! Uh, yeah, I want you to do that scared thing you did and make more ink.
,Squidward:, I will not! ,[slams the door],
,Patrick:, Huh?

,Squidward:, ,[answers the door], I said I will not—,[gasps],

,Squidward:, Huh? Hmm? ,[looks up and sees the giant spider; he screams], I hate spiders!
,[Squidward sprays ink out of his nose again. The ink sprays into Patrick's pitchers until they're full. Squidward climbs up the wall and crawls through the hole on the ceiling. He sprays more ink out from his nose and fills two more of Patrick's pitchers.],
,Patrick:, ,[on the spider's head; clicks his tongue], Hyah!
,[Squidward cowers behind a chair and whimpers.],
,Patrick:, ,[slides off the spider's back], Boo.

,Squidward:, Please! No!
,[Patrick closes the door and goes to the lemonade stand. He gives the pitchers to SpongeBob.],
,Patrick:, Oh? ,[sees a long line of customers], Oh... What? I got to get more black lemonade!

,Squidward:, Is it gone? ,[hears a clanging sound], What was that? Is someone there? ,[grabs a pan], Hello? Who is it? ,[hears the doorbell ring and hides under the rug],
,[Squidward peeks out from under the rug. Patrick continues to ring the bell. Squidward tiptoes to the door and slowly answers the door.],
,Squidward:, Hello?
,[The door slams itself shut, leaving Squidward locked outside. Squidward tries to open it to go back in, but it wouldn't budge. The lights turn on. Squidward turns around and finds himself in a haunted themed area made by Patrick himself.],

,Patrick:, Boo! I'm a haunted...,[swings over Squidward with a tablecloth over his body], tablecloth!
,[Squidward screams a sprays more ink out from his nose. The ink fills several cups, pitchers, bowls, and pails laid out by Patrick. Patrick swings himself into a wall and laughs.

,Squidward:, Not creepy nursery rhyme music!
,[Squidward hears a creaking sound in the crib behind him. He looks in the crib and sees Patrick wearing a creepy baby costume while having a nose similar to Squidward's.],

,Squidward:, The Krusty Krab? How did I wind up here? I don't think I want to go in. ,[a newspaper falls on him; he gasps as he reads it], This newspaper is dated 60 years into the future.

,[Squidward looks up and sees a puppet version of his old futuristic self in his workstation.],
,Puppet Squidward:, May I help you, young man?
,[Squidward's nose becomes a faucet and he screams the ink out of himself. Patrick, who is operating the old Squidward puppet, watches down happily.

,SpongeBob:, Squidward, if you want to buy some black lemonade, you'll have to get in the back of the line.

,Fish:, Think they can just walk right up!
,Squidward:, You mean you people actually drink this?
,[The crowd murmurs in agreement.],
,Squidward:, Huh? Huh? ,[smiles evilly and gets an idea], Huh! ,[grabs a megaphone and speaks into it], What if I told you you can buy black lemonade straight from the source?
,Don the Whale:, Source? We love the source!
,[The crowd murmurs in agreement. Squidward takes out a really big fan and blows SpongeBob, Patrick, the boat load of ink, and the lemonade stand away.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa!
,[Squidward forms his own stand and calls it ""Squidward's black lemonade"". The customers line up.],
,Don the Whale:, Uh, okay. So where's our black lemonade?
,Squidward:, Yes, of course. Coming right up. ,[attempts to spray more ink out from his nose, but nothing happens], Huh? ,[pokes his nose and blows it; he chuckles], Don't worry. I'll—I'll make some more. I just need a little recovery time. ,[wrings out his nose and blows it, only to blow out the inside of his nostrils],

,Dave:, Well, then, make with my black lemonade!
,Squidward:, Uh, can somebody please scare me?
,Don the Whale:, ,[grabs Squidward by the neck], Oh, I'll do better than that, jack! ,[goes to punch Squidward],
,[Squidward screams and sprays ink out from his nose onto Don's face. Squidward then sprays ink over the heads of the long line of customers. The customers gasp in shock and moan in disgust when they see that black lemonade was actually made out of Squidward's ink. Squidward stops spraying the ink and goes back to the his lemonade stand.],
,Squidward:, Black lemonade.
,Cara:, ,[grossed out], Oh... is that what black lemonade is? ,[gags],
,[The customers are completely grossed out. They trample onto Squidward and destroy the stand. Then they run into Squidward's house and throw up inside.],
,Squidward:, I don't get it. I thought they wanted...
,SpongeBob:, ,[he and Patrick are wearing gloves and aprons while holding trays of cookies], Hey, Squidward! You'll be happy to hear we're out of the black lemonade business. We found something new.
,Patrick:, Yeah, it's all yours, buddy. Homemade cookies.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[whispers], Yay.
,Squidward:, Huh. You know, a—a homemade cookie is just the kind of comfort food I could use right now. Thanks. ,[takes a cookie and eats it], Hey, these cookies are delicious! What's in them?
,Patrick:, Spider eggs!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, say hello to our new partner. ,[shows the giant red spider to Squidward], Mildred, you've met Squidward.

,SpongeBob:, No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good. ,[touches his body], Ooh, you're so cold. ,[knocks on his pants],
,Imitation Krabs:, That's just my metal suit. I made it to protect the formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! SpongeBob! ,[second ""SpongeBob!"" echos],
,Plankton:, It's that thick-headed Krabs. He'll ruin everything.
,Imitation Krabs:, Look, a jellyfish. ,[SpongeBob takes out his net and runs around],
,SpongeBob:, I got it, I got it.,[Plankton presses the ""Abort"" button. When he does, Imitation Krabs shrinks into a toaster], I got it, I got it ,[Mr. Krabs enters],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob stops and looks at the toaster, which releases its toast, then looks at Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[knocks on Mr. Krabs' pants], Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?
,SpongeBob:, You gave him the day off.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pupils shrink], Day... ,[bellows], ...oooooooooff?! ,[Mr. Krabs is so mad that he makes steam come out of the chimney], I don't know the meaning of them horrible words! ,[SpongeBob falls down], Now quit your laying around, SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash. ,[exits],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! ,[puts a clothespin on his nose and is going to take the trash out, but Imitation Krabs stops him], Hey, Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage.
,Imitation Krabs:, Never mind that. I need to talk to you. ,[takes the trash bag and vaporizes it with his laser eyes],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs. I didn't know you had heat vision.
,Imitation Krabs:, Never mind. I need you to tell me...
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob!
,Imitation Krabs:, Yoinks! ,[runs off],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around. ,[gives him a spatula], Get back to the kitchen!
,SpongeBob:, But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes... why aren't you working harder?
,SpongeBob:, ,[slowly], I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know. ,[both walk out],
,Plankton:, I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day. ,[holds up a penny], It looks like an ordinary penny... because it ,is, an ordinary penny! That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty. ,[laughs evilly. The penny pops out of the nose and rolls around into Mr. Krabs' office],
,Mr. Krabs:, That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of... ,[sees the penny], money! ,[squeals], Hey, where you going, beautiful? ,[SpongeBob knocks on Mr. Krabs' door],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs... ,[the penny slides out of the office], Wha... ,[Mr. Krabs busts down the door on top of SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Stop! Please! ,[the penny slides between the crack of the doors and rolls away with Mr. Krabs running after it], Wait! ,[Robot Krabs is hiding behind the sign pole],
,Imitation Krabs:, Nothing stands between me and that secret formula now. ,[snaps off some of the Krusty Krab sign pole. As he laughs evilly, the sign falls on top of him], Ouch! ,[cut to SpongeBob, who is scrubbing the floor],
,SpongeBob:, Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub. ,[Robot Mr. Krabs rolls by], Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'.
,Imitation Krabs:, Hello, SpongeBob, it is me, Mr. Krabs. ,[exhaust pipe smokes], In the flesh. ,[exhaust pipe smokes again], Standing right in front of you. ,[pipe smokes again], With no one else around.
,SpongeBob:, I can see that, Mr. Krabs.
,Imitation Krabs:, I thought we might discuss the Krabby Patty secret formula. ,[a microphone comes out of Imitation Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, Isn't that a microphone?
,Imitation Krabs:, What? Why, yes it is. ,[puts microphone back inside his body], I must get this shirt cleaned. Alright, now tell me the secret formula.
,SpongeBob:, But, sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet.
,Imitation Krabs:, Oh yes. Here, let's shake.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], We don't shake with our hands, remember?
,Imitation Krabs:, Uh, right, why don't you start?
,SpongeBob:, We stand on one foot. ,[they do], Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem. ,[they do],
,Music:, ""Bikini Bottom National Anthem""
,Oh, Bikini Bottom, we pledge our hearts to you, As faithful, as deep, as true, as blue, Bikini Bottom, we love you!
,Imitation Krabs:, Formula time?
,SpongeBob:, Almost.
,Narrator:, Six and a half hours later... ,[Plankton grunts frantically as he gets Robot Krabs into a cannon which spits him out, through a flame ring, and onto a chair at a table. He opens up the robot's belt buckle and dumps some spaghetti in there],
,Imitation Krabs:, Yum yum, this spaghetti sure is good. Belch!
,Music:, ""The Spaghetti Song""
,Meatball. Meatball. Spaghetti underneath. Ravioli. Ravioli. Great Barrier Reef. ,[They clap],
,Imitation Krabs:, Okay, now let's hear that formula.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, ,[takes off his chef mustache], no can do, Mr. Krabs. ,[Robot Krabs' eyes are on fire],
,Imitation Krabs:, Whaaaaaaaaaat?!
,Plankton:, ,[exploding in rage], But we did everything you said-- I followed all the rules! I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!
,Imitation Krabs:, Now why can't you tell me the formula?
,SpongeBob:, It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle. ,[holds up a bottle with a piece of paper in it],
,Plankton:, ,[Imitation Krabs opens its eyes, Plankton is overly excited and tense], This is it, Plankton. Gently, now... ,[pushes on a lever that makes Robot Krabs' arm stretch out more. A penny rolls through the door and Mr. Krabs comes in. Everyone gasps, including the guy on the penny],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasps],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Gasps],
,Guy on the Penny:, ,[Gasps],
,Imitation Krabs:, Gasp!
,Mr. Krabs:, How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!
,Imitation Krabs:, Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. Remember: Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the ,real, Mr. Krabs.
,Imitation Krabs:, Don't listen to him. He's obviously a robot. ,[exhaust pipe smokes],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!
,Imitation Krabs:, Who are you calling steam-driven...?
,SpongeBob:, ,[unable to handle the pressure, explodes in frustration], Quiet! ,[SpongeBob is holding a giant hose in his hands and his eyes bloodshot], Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves, ,[it is soon revealed that the hose is attached to a large tartar sauce machine], nobody gets hurt.
,Mr. Krabs and Imitation Krabs:, Tartar sauce?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Take it easy with that thing, son. ,[SpongeBob squirts some tartar sauce at Mr. Krabs causing him to jump into Imitation Krabs' arms],
,SpongeBob:, I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, then.
,SpongeBob:, First question: What time does the Krusty Krab open?
,Imitation Krabs:,  ,[beats Mr. Krabs to it], 9:30 A.M.
,SpongeBob:, Right. ,[to Mr. Krabs], That's one strike, Mr. Fake.
,Mr. Krabs:, But...
,SpongeBob:, Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two: How much does a Krabby Patty cost?
,Mr. Krabs:, $2.99!
,SpongeBob:, On Wednesday...
,Imitation Krabs:, 99¢!
,SpongeBob:, Right again! ,[to Mr. Krabs], You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this — If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass? ,[Mr. Krabs is shot out of the Krusty Krab with tartar sauce into a fry basket], Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance! ,[Rolls away in the basket], ,No!,
,SpongeBob:, So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye! ,[walks back inside], I knew it was you all along, Mr. Krabs, here you go. ,[holds up the formula bottle],
,Imitation Krabs:, Thank you, SpongeDupe. ,[grabs the bottle and laughs mechanically. SpongeBob sees a penny on the ground],
,SpongeBob:, Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny. ,[puts the penny inside a slot on Imitation Krabs that is labeled ""Self-Destruct: 1 cent""],
,Imitation Krabs:, Yoinks.
,SpongeBob:, This must be your lucky day. ,[laughs],
,Karen:, The self-destruct coin slot has been activated. Ten seconds 'til detonation.
,Plankton:, Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeelp! ,[screams as he wheels back to the Chum Bucket, but explodes when he gets inside. The giant hand thuds on top of him], Ouch! ,[the formula bottle rolls back to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Picks up the formula, realizing his mistake], If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!
,Mr. Krabs:, Help! Get Away! No!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mr. Krabs! ,[runs to Mr. Krabs, who is still in the fry basket using a fry to fight off Hans who has a fork],
,Hans:, Mmm…yum-yum.
,Mr. Krabs:, Back, you hungry hand, back! Help! ,[SpongeBob wheels Mr. Krabs back to the Krusty Krab safely],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony.
,Mr. Krabs:, Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again. ,[takes the bottle], However, that penny's coming out of your paycheck. ,[both laugh],
,SpongeBob:, Really?

"SpongeBob:, See anything yet, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I need my glasses. ,[puts two glasses of water on his eyes like binoculars, which are real human eyes.], Hmmm... ,[a mail truck approaches], ...it's the mail truck!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Our package! ,[Patrick throws the glasses and they both start dancing and hopping],
,Squidward:, I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.
,Norton:, SpongeBob SquarePants?
,SpongeBob:, That's me! ,[Norton throws a big box next to him and Patrick],
,Squidward:, That's a big box!
,SpongeBob:, Thank you! ,[still dancing and hopping],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?
,SpongeBob:, Thirty more seconds, Patrick. ,[rubs hands together],
,Squidward:, They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap. ,[laughs as SpongeBob and Patrick lift up a big-screen TV out of the box], Huh? A brand-new television?
,SpongeBob:, Easy... easy... ,[both him and Patrick throw the TV onto a trash-can],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Yeah! ,[jump into the box and close the flaps],
,Squidward:, Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider. ,[walks up to the box with SpongeBob and Patrick inside], Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?
,SpongeBob:, ,[as he emerges from the box], Pretty smart, huh?
,Patrick:, ,[emerges from the box], I thought it wouldn't work.
,Squidward:, Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah. ,[yells in SpongeBob and Patrick's faces], Don't you two have any brains?!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our... ,[makes a rainbow over his head with his hands], ...imagination!
,Squidward:, Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?
,SpongeBob:, With... ,[SpongeBob jumps on the flap of the box, makes another rainbow with his hands], ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate! ,[curls his finger in a hook shape], Arrrrr! A football player! ,[stands in a football player stance], Hup!
,Patrick:, A starfish!
,Squidward:, Patrick, you're already a starfish.
,Patrick:, See, Squidward? It works! You try!
,Squidward:, ,[rubs his two tentacles on both sides of his head], Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV... ,[points to the one on the trash-can], ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Sure, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! ,[Squidward runs to the TV and pushes it to his house],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
,Patrick:, Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!
,SpongeBob:, Let's go for it! ,[pulls the flaps of the box over on them], Gloves!
,Patrick:, Check.
,SpongeBob:, Hats!
,Patrick:, Check.
,SpongeBob:, Underwear!
,Patrick:, Uh... check!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
,Patrick:, You got it! ,[climbing noises come from the box],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
,Squidward:, I hope they put some air holes in that box. ,[goes inside his house],
,SpongeBob:, Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
,Patrick:, I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! ,Excelsior!,
,Squidward:, ,[opens his door], Now where's that remote? ,[walks up to the remote, which is right next to the box. He picks it up, puts it in his shirt and stands next to the box, listening to SpongeBob and Patrick],
,Patrick:, I am the lizard king! Whoo!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
,Patrick:, What?
,SpongeBob:, I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
,Patrick:, What should we keep down?
,Squidward:, Morons.
,SpongeBob:, Our voices!
,Squidward:, Will you two shut up?! ,[kicks the box, causing the sound of an avalanche, making SpongeBob and Patrick scream and fall, they both start to cry. Squidward is shocked], Sponge... Bob? ,[he softly touches the box, causing another avalanche],
,Patrick:, Hold me.
,SpongeBob:, Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw! ,[Squidward begins to sweat],
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, I can't do that!
,Patrick:, Why not?
,SpongeBob:, Because I already cut off my own arms! ,[Squidward kneels down],
,Patrick:, Nooooo!
,[Squidward quickly opens the box and looks in. SpongeBob and Patrick sit inside the box],
,Squidward:, [confused] What the? How were you two making that noise?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], What noise, Squidward?
,Patrick:, I could only hear the sound of our laughter.
,Squidward:, Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...
,Patrick:, Don't forget the second avalanche.
,Squidward:, Forget it. ,[closes the box], I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television. ,[helicopter sounds are heard from the box, Squidward looks around at the sky and ducks],
,Pilot Inside Box:, Attention climbers, please hold on! The saws are on the way!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Yay!
,Squidward:, Grrrr... Aha! ,[he opens the box again and sees SpongeBob and Patrick sitting inside the box again], How are you two doing that?
,SpongeBob:, First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet...
,Squidward:, The noises! How are you two making those noises?
,Patrick:, That's easy. All you need is a box.
,SpongeBob:, And... ,[makes another rainbow with his hands], ...imagination.
,Squidward:, ,[as SpongeBob and Patrick duck down into the box], Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination... ,[tries to make a rainbow with his hands, like SpongeBob, but is unsuccessful], ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.
,Patrick:, That's good. Now all you need is a box. ,[closes the box],
,Squidward:, ,[walks back to his house], I'll show them! ,[looks in his closet], There's got to be one in here! ,[finds a small, round green box], Ah! This hat box should do nicely. ,[pulls out a Mexican sombrero], Why haven't I worn this yet? ,[throws it off-screen, gets in the box but he is too big for it and then just sits there. He then frowns, looks at his watch and then gets mad and kicks the box. Police sirens are heard],
,Policeman Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's box:, Attention! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
,Squidward:, What do they want with me? What did I do? ,[he gasps], Obviously, I've violated some new box kicking law! ,[walks out of his house showing the green box], Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!
,Criminal Inside Box:, You'll never take me alive, coppers!
,Man Inside Box:, No, Johnny! Don't do it! ,[Police sirens are heard. Squidward gets angry and kicks his green box toward SpongeBob and Patrick's box],
,Patrick:, ,[opens box and sirens stop], Whoopee! Another box! ,[Patrick takes the hat box and closes the box they're sitting in and police sirens are heard again],
,Squidward:, I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV. ,[turns on TV to see a show with boxes on a conveyor belt in a factory],
,Male TV narrator:, It is here that the boxes reach their final stage of assembly. ,[changes channel to an old professor talking about a box equation on a chalkboard],
,Professor:, The equation is illustrated here by this box. ,[changes channel to a soap opera with a man and woman],
,Man:, I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box. ,[he holds up a box],
,Woman:, That's what I got you! ,[she also holds up a box],
,Squidward:, Isn't there anything on that isn't about ,boxes?!, ,[changes channel to a boxing match on TV],
,Announcer:, And welcome back to Championship Boxing.
,Squidward:, ,[chuckles in hope], Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes. ,[two boxes go at each other in the ring], I give up.
,Astronaut Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's Box:, 3... 2... 1... blast off! ,[a loud rocket takes off noises are heard from the box],
,Squidward:, ,[fascinated], How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think! ,[he imagines SpongeBob and Patrick playing a tape recorder with real rocket sound effects],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward's such a jerk. ,[both laugh],
,Squidward:, Laugh at me, will they? ,[opens box once again], All right, where is it?
,Patrick:, ,[comes out of Squidward's green hat box], Here I am!
,SpongeBob:, Where's what, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Don't ""Where's what, Squidward?"" me! Where's the tape recorder?
,SpongeBob:, We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Don't ""We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!"" me!
,SpongeBob:, But we don't!
,Patrick:, ,[holds up a small, white, rectangular box in his hand], We have a tape recorder box.
,Squidward:, ,[takes the small, white box from Patrick and throws it offscreen], All right, make way you two, I'm coming in. ,[gets into box],
,SpongeBob:, Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S... ,[makes a rainbow with his hands once more], ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?
,Squidward:, No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is all about! It's about... ,[makes one last rainbow with his hands], ...imagination.
,Squidward:, All right, fine! ,[as he makes the rainbow go away with his hands], Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick close their eyes and make pirate and robot sounds],
,Patrick:, ,[imitates robot] ,Beep-beep-beep.
,SpongeBob:, ,[imitates pirate], Arr.
,Patrick:, Beep-boop-bee-boop.
,SpongeBob:, Ahoy matey!
,Patrick:, Beep-beep.
,SpongeBob:, For that you'll walk the plank! ,[SpongeBob giggles softly, and Patrick starts chuckling goofily],
,Squidward:, ,[he gets angry. he growls], Why won't this thing turn on?! ,[he slams the bottom of the box with his fists], All right, fine. If you don't want to show me, ,[gets out of the box], I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing. ,[Squidward paces back and forth in his house], How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that! ,[he hears real robot/pirate, battle noises from box], Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to! ,[he sits in his chair until nighttime],
,[firework and cheering sounds are heard coming from the box. Patrick and SpongeBob come out of the box and Patrick yawns], I need sleep to refuel my imagination tanks!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Squidward looks out of his window], I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.
,Patrick:, Yeah, see you in the morning.
,SpongeBob:, Good night, Patrick. ,[they both go into their houses],
,[Squidward sneaks out of his house. He tiptoes over to the box and gets inside],
,Squidward:, ,[He chuckles mischievously and then sees a piece of paper on the side of the box], Hello, what's this? ,[reads], ""This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh! ,[tears paper into pieces with anger], I've got to find that button quick! ,[looks around the box], It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really ,was, their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises? ,[pushes his foot down and the sound of an engine revving is heard], What the...? ,[Squidward turns the imaginary key], It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot! ,[laughs], Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had! ,[the noises actually come from a garbage truck, which lifts the box into the other garbage],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Squidward cheering in the distance], Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great.
,Squidward:, ,[the garbage truck begins to drive away with the box that Squidward is in], Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line! ,[the garbage truck dumps out the trash, including the box], I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there! ,[laughs as the box slides down a trash pile], Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine! ,[the box hits something, sending Squidward tumbling down, face first onto a cherry pie. He groans and the box falls on him. The next morning, SpongeBob and Patrick come out of their houses],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, our box is gone!
,Patrick:, Oh, well.
,SpongeBob:, I know! Let's go see Squidward!
,Patrick:, I hope he's not too down in the dumps today. ,[he and SpongeBob walk to Squidward's house and a timpani noise is heard in the background as the screen fades to black],

"[SpongeBob and Patrick are at the Jellyfish Convention, where everything is about jellyfish. SpongeBob is wearing a jellyfish hat and Patrick is wearing a net on his head],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! I can't believe it! We're actually here at the biannual Jellyfish Convention!
,Patrick:, Jellyfish are awesome!
,SpongeBob:, Cool! State-of-the-art jellyfish nets!
,Patrick:, ,[touches one of the nets], Touch.

,Dr. Manowar:, ,[Talking in a microphone], And now it only hurts when you touch it. ,[Patrick goes up and touches his sore. Manowar screams in pain],

,Patrick:, Ice cream?

The coolest jellyfish enthusiast ever! ,[close up on the cucumber], Kevin the Sea Cucumber!
,Patrick:, What's so great about a nerdy pickle?
,SpongeBob:, If I could just touch the hem of his pocket protector, then maybe some of his greatness would rub off on me.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, as a friend, I must say that's really geeky. ,[a guy in a giant jellyfish costume walks by. Patrick gasps], Oh my gosh! Jeffrey Jellyfish! Wait, Jeffrey! I have to touch you! ,[runs after him, followed by the guard yelling.],
,Guard:, Hey! ,[Chases Patrick, cut back to the Jellyspotters],

,SpongeBob:, No, wait! I would do anything for you!
,Kevin:, Why don't you go jump off a building? ,[we hear SpongeBob's scream and see him fall from the view through the window. Then SpongeBob appears back in the building],
,SpongeBob:, Anything!
,Kevin:, Punch yourself in the face. ,[SpongeBob does so with a boxing glove. His face is pushed in a bit], Doesn't that hurt you?

,Anchovy Jellyspotter:, No, Kevin, no. He's a geek.
,Kevin:, ,[whispering], Look, I won't let the guy join the club. I just want to see how many times he can get stung before he goes running home like a baby.

,Kevin:, Hey, kid. how would you like to try out for the Jellyspotters?

,SpongeBob:, ,[breathes out], Uh... here we are, Jellyfish Fields. Ohh... ,[he collapses. The Jellyspotters get off],
,Kevin:, I hope you didn't forget our nets.
,SpongeBob:, I didn't forget them, Kevin. They're in the trunk. ,[SpongeBob turns around, and the back of his pants opens like a trunk. The group takes the nets and jars out, revealing SpongeBob's buttocks. SpongeBob now has all the nets and jars in his arms], I can't believe I'm actually out here with the Jellyspotters! I mean all my life I wanted to be a Jellyspotter... ,[SpongeBob starts to vibrate and jump around], ...and now I'm out here with you guys with the nets and the jars and the jellyfish and I'm with Kevin and Kevin's with me and we're all with each other and we're all jellyfishing and it's fun and-
,Kevin:, Hold it! ,[SpongeBob freezes, literally], Before you become a Jellyspotter, you have to pass a rigorous test.
,Jellyspotters:, ,[laughing], Meep! Rigorous test! ,[continuing laughing],
,Kevin:, ,[To the Jellyspotters], Quiet!, Shh! ,[To SpongeBob], Your first test: catch a jellyfish. ,[a jellyfish flies into SpongeBob's net],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I caught one! Am I a Jellyspotter now?
,Jellyspotters:, Meep, he caught one. ,[""Meep"" discussions],
,Kevin:, Uh, that doesn't count. ,[he slaps the net and the jellyfish flies out and stings the side of his head], Ouch! ,[The jellyfish flies away. Kevin grows a giant red sore where he got stung.],
,Anchovy Jellyspotter:, ,[off-screen in ominous voice], Wah-wah-waaaaah!
,Kevin:, I meant two jellyfish! ,[two jellyfish immediately fly in SpongeBob's net],
,Jellyspotters:, Two jellyfish, meep, in the net. ,[""Meep"" discussions],
,Kevin:, Th-That's not what I meant! I meant 20 jellyfish! ,[18 more jellyfish immediately fly into SpongeBob's net],
,SpongeBob:, ,[counting], Oh, Uh, let's see, one, two, three? ,[Kevin growls and kicks the net, causing all 20 jellyfish to sting him in a blaze of electricity.],
,Kevin:, Ooh-ooh-ow! Ooh! Ow! ,[The jellyfish fly off, leaving Kevin with a bunch of sores all over his body],
,Anchovy Jellyspotter:, ,[off-screen in ominous voice], Wah-wah-waaaaah! ,[cut to the fields, where Kevin has a jar of jelly],
,Kevin:, Jellyspotters allow jellyfish to eat jelly off their face. ,[Kevin smears some jelly on the lower half SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, Who wants to lick my cheeks? ,[some jellyfish swim by], I see I have some takers!
,Kevin:, How does it feel?
,SpongeBob:,  ,[sporting a huge jellyfish mustache and beard. He laughs], It tickles my nose!
,Kevin:, Not for long. ,[he and the Jellyspotters snicker. SpongeBob sneezes, firing the entire swarm of jellyfish onto Kevin's eyes. They sting them and now he has big red swollen eyes],
,Anchovy Jellyspotter:, Wah-wah-waaaaah!
,Kevin:, ,[turns to the fish making that taunting noise], Will you cut that out?!
,SpongeBob:, Am I in the Jellyspotters now?
,Kevin:, No! But I have many more tests for you to take! ,[cut to SpongeBob walking upside-down, with a net and a jellyfish],
,SpongeBob:, Am I in the Jellyspotters now? ,[the jellyfish stings Kevin's nose, making it big and swollen],
,Kevin:, No. ,[cut to SpongeBob having caught a jellyfish blindfolded],
,SpongeBob:, Am I in the Jellyspotters now? ,[the jellyfish stings Kevin's crown and it becomes swollen, into some broccoli-shaped blister],
,Kevin:, No. ,[cut to just SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Now? ,[we hear zapping sounds. Now Kevin's ears are big and swollen],
,Kevin:, No. ,[cut to just SpongeBob again],
,SpongeBob:, Now? ,[more zapping noises. Kevin's lips are now huge and swollen],
,Kevin:, No. ,[cut to Sponge once more],
,SpongeBob:, Now? ,[Jellyfish zaps Kevin. Kevin's butt is now huge and swollen],
,Kevin:, ,[screaming], NO!
,SpongeBob:, Now? ,[Jellyfish zaps Kevin], Now? ,[Jellyfish zaps Kevin], Now? ,[now, Kevin is just a big swollen sea cucumber thing],
,Kevin:, Okay, SquarePants, it is ,your, turn to get zapped! I mean... are you ready for your final test?
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready!
,Kevin:, You'd better be, because we're going to capture a queen jellyfish.
,SpongeBob:, A queen? Can I help?
,Kevin:, Oh, don't worry. We can't do it without you! ,[cut to SpongeBob being tied by arms and legs, hanging from two sticks],
,SpongeBob:, This is fantastic! I've never been bait before! I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either.
,Kevin:, Well, then you've probably never used a queen jellyfish call. Why don't you try it out? ,[he hands him a blower thing. SpongeBob blows and it makes a weird groaning sound that sort of sounds like, ""Loser.""],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I've heard this call before.
,Kevin:, I'll bet you have. ,[the Jellyspotters walk off],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, where are you going?
,Kevin:, Oh, don't worry, we'll be right behind this bush. ,[they kneel down behind it. Kevin gets zapped again. He stands up covered in sores, a jellyfish flies off], Who's got my sting ointment? ,[he kneels down again],
,SpongeBob:, This is great! When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter! ,[he continues to blow that horn thing, which keeps saying, ""Loser."" Soon, it becomes dark and he's tired of blowing], Hey, Kevin. I don't think it's working. Nothing. ,[a giant shadow looms over SpongeBob. He looks up, to find a giant jellyfish with a tiara.], Hey, hey, Kevin! She's here! Look, she's here! She's here, Kevin! She... ,[the bush blows away, revealing nothing, except Kevin's ointment. SpongeBob screams and the jellyfish zaps the poles off. SpongeBob runs up and down hills, dodging the jellyfish's stingers. He comes upon a cliff and can't go any further. He begs on his hands and knees], Please don't be angry, your highness! I would have let you go! ,[cries. Just then, a screen on the jellyfish opens, revealing Kevin and the Jellyspotters, controlling the machine from the inside. They laugh. SpongeBob gasps], Kevin!
,Kevin:, That's right! You should have seen the look on your face when we zapped you!
,SpongeBob:, But... What about my final test? ,[they all laugh],
,Kevin:, Did you think we'd ,actually, let you into the Jellyspotters?
,SpongeBob:, But, Kevin, I was your biggest fan!
,Kevin:, So were they. ,[he points to the bottom of the cliff, where a bunch of people are by a fire. One looks up],
,Guy:, Hey, look, everybody. Kevin's back! ,[they all yell up at him in praise],
,Kevin:, You looked so dumb with your dorky jellyfish call! ,[He and the Jellyspotters imitating], Loser, loser, loser loser loser! ,[SpongeBob blushes and sadly frowns],
,SpongeBob:, I am not a loser!
,Kevin:, Loooooser! ,[as Kevin continues saying ""loser,"" a giant, even bigger than the queen, jellyfish comes from the cliff. It is wearing a robe and a crown.], Ah-ha-ha-ha! ,[The Jellyspotters finally notice], Cnidaria rex!
,SpongeBob:, King Jellyfish! ,[the king sees the queen and is instantly smitten. It grows lips and puckers up],
,Kevin:, Kissy face! ,[the queen and SpongeBob run off. The king gives a chase. The queen eventually crashes into a billboard for Kevin's Ointment and breaks apart.],
,Jellyfish King:, Huh? ,[The king sees Kevin, the Jellyspotters, and SpongeBob. Record scratch sound effect. Kevin quivers.], ,[angrily], Keeeee-viiiiin! ,[it zaps the ground and they all run off. They find refuge in a cave. The king jellyfish comes back with a helmet and football uniform and attempts to bash in the cave. Inside, the Jellyspotters and SpongeBob are pretty scared. The bashing stops],
,Kevin:, I think he's gone. One of you, go out and check. ,[the Jellyspotters push one fish out of the cave to see. The anchovy Jellyspotter looks around and ""meep-meep""s happily, giving the all-clear. He soon gets zapped and ""meep-meep""s not to come out. All the Jellyspotters go around Kevin asking what to do], 
,Jellyspotters:, Meep! Save us! Meep Kevin, save us! ,[more meep begging],
,Kevin:, Don't look at me! I was just in this for the fashion! ,[close up on Kevin's pants, with patches, stickers and a toy jellyfish coming out of his pocket], It's hopeless! We're trapped! We're trapped! ,[he sits down and curls to a ball], Help me, mommy! Help me! I want my blankie! I want my blankie!
,SpongeBob:, ,[to the fish], Now what do we do? ,[the Jellyspotters get down and imitate Kevin. SpongeBob decides enough is enough and goes out to face the king. The king growls and buzzes. SpongeBob takes out a bottle of bubble mix in response.],
,Jellyfish King:, What the? ,[SpongeBob inhales and blows a bubble in the shape of a giant cherry pie. The king, satisfied, leaves to eat his snack.], Hmm? Mm, mm, mm! Yummy! ,[The jellyspotters come out and gather around SpongeBob. Other jellyspotters ""meep"" happily. Kevin follows],
,Kevin:, I can't believe it! How did you know?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Everybody loves pie!
,Anchovy Jellyspotter:, ,[ominous voice], Wah-wah-waaaaah!
,Kevin:, Well, SquarePants, that was impressive, but you're still not in the club because you didn't catch a queen jellyfish. ,[the other Jellyspotters narrow their eyes and run over to Kevin, off-screen], Wait, what are you doing? ,[rip], Aaah! ,[the fish run back with Kevin's crown and place it on SpongeBob. He laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, I didn't know this was a hat!
,Kevin:, ,[teary-eyed; with a torn part where his ""crown"" used to be], It wasn't...
,[cut to back at the convention. SpongeBob talks to Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob! Did you get into that club?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but I turned them down. It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish!
,Patrick:, Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson. ,[pan out to see that Patrick has Jeffrey Jellyfish tied up in a wagon he's towing], Hero worship is unhealthy. ,[the two walk off], C'mon, Jeffrey.

"[Patrick's house is shaking. SpongeBob knocks on it. Every time he does, it closes. He opens it himself. Patrick is cleaning frantically. He feather-dusts SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, Need...furniture! ,[makes a lamp post model out of the sand, then licks it to make it remain in shape; he then makes a sand drawer, television, stool, and a couch. The whole time he is still frantically mumbling],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what's with the home improvement? ,[Patrick barks like a dog and continues to clean], Hey, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Oooooooh, sweep sweep! ,[Sweeps around the walls of his house and the air],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Patrick, I came over to see if you wanted to go jellyfishing. But I can see you're busy having an episode.
,Patrick:, ,[Stops cleaning. His face turns mad], You know something, SpongeBob? It's just all fun and games for you. Nothing really matters. ,[imitates SpongeBob], ""Oh, let's go jellyfishing! We don't have any work to do! Life is just a big bowl of fancy assorted cashews, and nobody has anything to dust or to clean or to wipe! Or fabricate!""
,SpongeBob:, But, Patrick, the only thing I've ever seen you clean is your plate.
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick snaps out of being angry and starts crying], I don't know what to do, SpongeBob. You gotta to help me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel.
,Patrick:, No, it's not that, SpongeBob; it's worse.
,SpongeBob:, Darn, I like the funnel. Well, what is it, then?
,Patrick:, Look! ,[Takes out a rolled-up piece of paper from his belly button],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, a note! ,[A sixteenth note is shown],
,Patrick:, Yeah, but turn it over, there's a letter! ,[The letter B is shown],
,SpongeBob:, You're right!
,Patrick:, And, I got this message from my parents! ,[Hands out a smaller letter],
,SpongeBob:, Your parents? ,[Reads the note out loud], ""Dear Patrick, your mom and I are coming out tomorrow for Starfish Day. Please try to remember, but don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself like last time. Love, Daddy.""
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, my parents think I'm dumber than a sack of diapers.
,SpongeBob:, No, they don't, Patrick. Parents just like to push your buttons. Like this! ,[pushes Patrick's nipples and his eyes elongate], Nauuugh!
,Patrick:, ,[Laughing], That always cheers me up. ,[His eyes go back to normal], But not today.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, if your parents think you're dumb, then they must not know what dumb really is.
,Patrick:, But don't they watch television?
,SpongeBob:, That's what I'm saying, Pat! If your parents got to meet a real dummy, they'd realize what a genius you really are!
,Patrick:, But don't geniuses live in a lamp? And besides, we don't know any dumb people.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Patrick! I'll be the dummy! When your parents see how dumb I act, they'll think you're the smartest guy ever!
,Patrick:, Math is power!

,Patrick:, W, X, Y and Z! ,[Marty doesn't realize the door has been opened and knocks on Patrick's head], Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
,Marty:, Son! You recognized us this time!
,Patrick:, Why wouldn't I recognize my own parents?
,Marty:, You never were a bright one. ,[Patrick groans. Marty laughs], Well, aren't you gonna show us inside?
,Janet:, He probably forgot where it is.
,Patrick:, Well, I know where it...
,Marty:, Oh, let me lead the way so we don't get lost. ,[Patrick, Marty and Janet hold hands], Huh? Hold hands now! ,[Inside the house], Okay, we're almost there! Let go on three. One... two... three! ,[Marty and Janet let go of Patrick's hands on three],
,Janet:, Good job!
,Marty and Janet:, Pats for Patrick! ,[Both laugh as Patrick looks annoyed],
,Patrick:, I'll go get the beverages. ,[Patrick leaves, then comes back with a tray with three drinks on it],
,Marty:, Wow, son! You put the drinks ,in, something this time! Ah, son, you must've been working all night to put these together for us.

,Marty:, Hello there!

,SpongeBob:, Hi. ,[translation: ""I am doing great. I'll come in."" He walks to Patrick's parents],
,Marty:, Put 'er there. ,[SpongeBob puts a doll on his hand],
,Doll:, Mama! Mama!

Grab my dad's hand. ,[Puts both his hands and his left leg on Marty's hand], Grab it with only one hand! ,[Puts his left leg and hand down], Good boy! Now move your arm up and down! ,[He moves his shoulder up and down. Patrick giggles],
,Janet:, So, SpongeBob. Do you live nearby?
,SpongeBob:, Hi. ,[translation: ""Yes! I live with Patrick.""],
,Patrick:, No, SpongeBob. Show them your house! ,[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and reveals a blouse], No, not your blouse! Your house! ,[SpongeBob screams and runs over to his house. He runs into the shell and gets stuck],
,Janet:, He lives in a fruit?
,Marty:, That's unhealthy.
,Patrick:, ,[Giggling goofily], Hey, SpongeBob! You wanna stay for dinner?
,SpongeBob:, ,[babbling like an idiot; translation: ""My Pleasure, Patrick, my friend.""],
,[Later, Patrick, Marty and Janet are watching television while eating TV dinners],
,Marty:, Does he always do that after he eats?
,Patrick:, Only on Wednesday. ,[Pan over to SpongeBob pushing his nose to reveal his underwear. When he lets go, his pants pull up by themselves. This is repeated a few times. SpongeBob makes an alarm sound after that. Patrick giggles],
,Marty:, ,[Starts giggling with Patrick], Uh, Patrick, I think your friend might be broken.
,Patrick:, Yeah. And it would take more than some masking tape to fix that guy. ,[SpongeBob balances on his nose while making a fire truck siren sound. Makes other various sounds, including a cat yowl sound],
,Marty:, Whoa! Is he gonna be okay?
,Patrick:, Oh, that's nothing. ,[Dolphin chirping], You should see him in the morning prancing around yelling ""I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!"" ,[Rooster crows], He drives all the neighbors crazy! ,[Horn], Why, just the other day, our neighbor Squidward was--- ,[SpongeBob jumps backwards over Patrick, Janet and Marty while making an elephant trumpet sound, then he crashes on the floor],. ---was really no help for him. ,[SpongeBob makes imprints of his front and back twice on the wall], I mean, look at the way he's dressed. Only somebody with holes drilled in their head would wear that stuff! And how about his shape? I mean, I've heard of barrel-chested, ,[Shows closeup of SpongeBob's pants], but never box-chested! ,[Janet, Marty and Patrick laugh. SpongeBob frowns], Hey, SpongeBob, do you have any ,mascara, I could borrow? ,[Makes his eyebrows sound like elastic rubber bands],
,Marty:, ,[Chuckles], The boy wears make-up?
,Janet:, What a card! ,[Everyone laughs, except SpongeBob, who's now very annoyed],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Confused], Hey, Patrick! Patrick!
,Patrick:, Aw, he said my name.
,Marty:, Wow, how'd you train him to do that?
,[SpongeBob is mad. He bites Patrick's finger],
,Patrick:, Ow! He bit me!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, meet me in the kitchen!
,Patrick:, Oh, I guess the dummy wants to have a private conversation. ,[Janet and Marty laugh], A dumb one! ,[They laugh again, as SpongeBob and Patrick enter the kitchen], So, what's on your mind? Oh, wait, I already know the answer. Nothing! ,[Patrick laughs very hard], See, that's funny. 'Cause your dumb!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, could you let up on the insults just a little bit?
,Patrick:, Oh, were those too complicated for you? I'll try dumb-ing them down a bit.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I get the feeling that you think I really ,am, dumb! ,[glances at Patrick's t-shirt, ""I'M WITH THE DUMMY"" with an arrow pointing towards SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, That's just what I'd expect you to say. Dumb people are always blissfully unaware of how dumb they really are. ,[drools],
,SpongeBob:, I'm only ,pretending, to be dumb! It was our plan, remember?!
,Patrick:, Oh, SpongeBob, if only you could see how stupid you sound right now, with your talk of imaginary plans. Tell you what. You've caught me at a good mood. I'll humor you. Go on, go out there and act ""smart"" for everyone.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I will! ,[Takes off his helmet],
,Patrick:, ,[Puts on the helmet], And don't worry, I'll keep this warm for ya!
,SpongeBob:, ,[In front of Janet and Marty, clears throat], I have a confession to make. I lied about being stupid. I just acted like a fool so you would appreciate Patrick a little bit more. I know how to talk, and eat, and do laundry. I even separate the darks from the lights. So what do you say we start over and try again? Hi! My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. And I am not a dummy.
,Marty:, ,[laughs], Amazing! Three minutes in the kitchen and our son has taught him to talk in complete sentences. ,[Puts his right thumb up], Oh, good work, son!
,Patrick:, ,[Puts his left thumb up], It wasn't easy, dad.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sputtering], But... but, but, but, but, but, but...
,Janet:, It looks like it's time for your next lesson, young man!
,SpongeBob:, Now, listen to me! I'm not dumb! I have a brain! See? Here's a picture of it! ,[He shows them a small picture of his brain],
,Patrick:, That must be actual size. ,[All except SpongeBob laughs],
,SpongeBob:, No! It's normal size and fully functional, watch. ,[Writes on Patrick's chalkboard], 2 plus 2 equals 4.
,Marty:, Hoho, son! You taught him math, too!
,SpongeBob:, Noooo!
,Marty:, ,And, you taught him to sing! ,[SpongeBob is blabbering and sputtering, then starts tensing up], Oh, now he's short-circuiting! You must have taught him a little too much.
,[SpongeBob imagines the three all laughing hard, because of SpongeBob's intelligence. Marty and Janet look at each other and laugh; then the three starfish all do the can-can. He imagines the three popping out of SpongeBob's pores. SpongeBob is inside Janet, who is laughing, inside Marty, who is also laughing, inside Patrick, who is also laughing, inside his eye.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Screams at the top of his voice, then starts running towards the wall, crashing through the wall outside, running all the way back home],
,Marty:, You know, son, I've always known that when it comes to brightness, well, you're about a three-watt. But this guy! He's a wet match in a dark cave. He makes phone operators seem smart! ,[clears his throat], But more importantly, son, he's shown me what a sharp, quick-witted boy you've become. ,[Hugs him], Ha! I feel like I'm really meeting you for the first time. Isn't that right, Janet?
,Janet:, You bet, Marty!
,Patrick:, ,[His eyes widen], Janet?! Marty?! Who are you people?!
,Janet:, Marty, I'm scared! ,[Doorbell rings, then the rock opens up. Squidward, Herb and Margie are outside his rock],
,Squidward:, Excuse me. Does this lovely couple belong to you? They've been standing outside my house saying ""Where's Patrick?"" all day! It's driving me nuts!
,Patrick:, Mom! Dad!
,Herb:, Wow, son! You actually recognized us this time.
,Margie:, And you remembered to get dressed today! ,[Patrick, Herb and Margie laugh],
,Marty:, Oh, that's right, honey. We don't have a son.
,Janet:, Oh yeah! ,[Both walk away. Patrick and his parents laugh as their rock closes over them, then the screen fades to black, ending the episode],

"[The scene zooms in on Squidward's house. The door opens and Squidward appears],
,Squidward:, The coast looks clear... ,[He steps outside, and closes the door to his house, and standing in front of it with his hands over it as if he does not want anyone to see him. He tiptoes away down the road and walks by SpongeBob's pineapple house just as it opens], 
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward! ,[Squidward grunts and keeps walking down the street. SpongeBob starts jogging toward Squidward and stops right in front of him. Squidward stops walking. SpongeBob raises his hand in the air and twirls around. He starts tapping his feet. He points near Squidward's forehead, and in the other direction as he turns around], 
,SpongeBob:, Today, I feel like doing some dancing! ,[He points down, and then points to Squidward as the music stops], 
,Squidward:, That's funny. Even a barnacle knows you need music to dance. ,[SpongeBob puts his finger up to his mouth and starts shaking his butt side to side], 
,SpongeBob:, Oh-ho, I got music, friend... ,[SpongeBob runs up to Squidward], ...in my mind! ,[SpongeBob takes out his brain, musical notes come out of it and upbeat surf music plays. He turns a dial, and upbeat ukulele music comes out of it. He turns it again, and acoustic ballad music plays. Scene goes back to SpongeBob, still holding his brain up out of his head], Oh, I love this song! ,[He throws his brain up into the air, and runs away. He takes off his hat with a funny face, and his brain lands back into his head. He rubs his hands together], Here I go! ,[He starts walking back and forth and waving his floppy arms mysteriously, with a face as if he is sleepwalking. Maracas join the music. He turns, and starts moving his legs forward and in back of each other], 
,Squidward:, That is ,the, stupidest dance move I've ever seen! ,[SpongeBob huffs and makes a face not like any other to this reaction], 
,SpongeBob:, Who put you on the planet? ,Rueegh!, ,[The scene goes back to Squidward still walking toward the Krusty Krab, but SpongeBob is walking backwards behind him with a cheerful face. Now, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob lifts his leg, and uses his spatula to pick up six patties, and then hops on the wall. He flies up the wall, onto the ceiling, and the gravity forces down the patties onto one big plate with six smaller plates on it, but the patties all land on the same plate. Then, the patties all bounce onto the plate they should be on. SpongeBob walks over to the plate with his hands over his pants as if he has to pee, then he lifts his arm, then his other in a pattern, then twirls around. When he stops, the top buns are on his back. They all fly off, and onto the patties one at a time. The door swings open, and SpongeBob with a smile holds up all six Krabby Patties in one hand with Squidward still watching. Then, he throws the patties up into the air, and starts whistling, walking backwards right then left, then stops when the patties all fly on Squidward's head. SpongeBob's hands are up in the air when one grabs the giant plate. Then, he runs away skipping and varying the plate with one hand again. A scene from the cash register-boat is seen with Squidward's face flat, and then he moans. SpongeBob points to the ground closing his eyes, twirling the plate on one finger. Then, a close-up scene of the plate appears, and all the Krabby Patties fly of the big plate, still on their little ones all to the right customers. A customer receives his patty, a drink, some french fires, a sandwich on french bread, and then a pizza appears and lands on top of the table covering everything else. He sticks his tongue out like a dog getting ready to eat it, but a knight falls on it. Then, the entire table collapses. SpongeBob is now seen in front of the door. He is still twirling the plate around on one finger, then he twirls himself around, and he starts to float in the air. He lands in front of another customer's table, and all that is left on the plate is one Krabby Patty. He starts sliding left, then he slides right, and gallops like a sea horse, and jump ropes over the patty once, and falls down. SpongeBob gets back up, and starts moving his legs, and takes his hat off, holding the plate in the other hand. He then holds the patty with two hands for a quick second, and the area where his neck is splits in half marked by the top of his shirt, and the patty slips through the opening. Then, he does that again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and then he jumps up, and uses the patty like a rope to swing back to where he was before in front of the table. He then smiles, and bows causing the patty to slide off of the giant plate, and onto the table], 
,SpongeBob:, Your Krabby Patty, ma'am. ,[he raises the plate], Now eat it, swallow it, and chew it down! 
,Female Fish:, Oh, thank you very much, darling. And your dance moves are pretty cool, too. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[he bends his head back], Really? ,[he runs up to the woman], You like my dancin'? 
,Female Fish:, ,[holding a cell phone with an antenna coming out of it], That's right, kid. You got the dazzle, dazzle, dazzle. I love how you did that shuffle into the moonsault, and then stuck the landing!
,SpongeBob:, ,[giggles], Well, that's very nice of you to say. ,[he starts walking away], 
,Female Fish:, Wait! I'm not finished speaking words. I'm a high-class talent agent and I want to invite you to an audition. I have a very talented client who needs a backup dancer and you got what it takes! ,[gives SpongeBob a card], Come down to my dance studio tomorrow afternoon. You're goin' places, kid. ,[she walks away. SpongeBob runs next to the cash register-boat], 
,Squidward:, Would you please stop dancing? 
,SpongeBob:, No, I can't stop dancin' now, Squidward. I have to practice for my big audition tomorrow! ,[holds up his card in front of Squidward whose eyes are following it], 
,Squidward:, You got a dance audition? 
,SpongeBob:, That's right! ,[starts moving his feet], So I gotta practice as much as I can before tomorrow. ,[as he runs back into the kitchen], Got a dance audition. 
,Squidward:, That idiot has a dance audition? He doesn't know the first thing about the subtle intricacies of dance! ,[sighs], Let him practice till he drops! He's never gonna get that part. ,[stops, with a mischievous smile], That's it! He'll just have to practice 'til he drops! When he does, I'll be there all leotarded up and ready to show my stuff! ,[jumps into the kitchen window], Oh, SpongeBob! SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob...,[jumps onto the kitchen ground], ...duh, I mean, uh... ,[his eyelids droop a little],... I suppose I could take you under my tutelage, you know, show you a few moves. 
,SpongeBob:, Under your tutelage, really? You mean it? ,[SpongeBob's mouth shrinks and Squidward puts his hand on him], 
,Squidward:, But, you must do exactly what I say. Got that? 
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob's eyes grow], I am dance-putty in your hands! ,[The scene appears at Squidward's house, first from the outside, then from the inside. SpongeBob and Squidward are both on the top floor with dancing outfits on.], 
,Squidward:, ,[writing on check board], Hmm... ,[Squidward walks behind SpongeBob, and pulls his headband, and it snaps right back, with a little flash], 
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what are you doing, Squidward? 
,Squidward:, Oh, um, just a physical assessment I do with all of my new pupils. ,[giggles], Yeah, I'd say judging from the condition of those flabby ankles... 
,SpongeBob:, Flabby? 
,Squidward:, That's right. You need some physical conditioning before you ,ever, set foot on a dance parquet. I want you to run to the top of Oyster Peak then back. ,[points away],{
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts running], Oh, anything to get rid of these flabby ankles of mine. 
,Squidward:, ,[the scene cuts to Squidward's face, smiling mischievously], By the time that idiot gets back, he'll be too tired to dance! ,[Squidward starts laughing as a zooming sound sounds, and SpongeBob appears right next to Squidward, but his head is not exactly looking at him], 
,Squidward:, ,[drops everything], What are you doing here? 
,SpongeBob:, I'm back from Mount Oyster! ,[takes out a snowglobe and hands it to Squidward], Here. ,[The scene moves onto the snowglobe only], Got this for you at the gift shop ,[as always, snow is falling from the snowglobe, and jingle bells are heard], 
,Squidward:, Fine! ,[takes the snowglobe and throws it over his shoulder and picks up SpongeBob], Let's move on to our first dance lesson. ,[Squidward puts him down on the treadmill and points to the treadmill], I want you to moonwalk on this treadmill while I read this entire novel! ,[Squidward walks away whilst SpongeBob starts moonwalking on the treadmill. Cuts to Squidward in the library, reading the novel on a blue chair with a purple lamp shining above his head], 
,Squidward:, ,[finishes novel], Huh? Huh? What, is he still at it? ,[Squidward opens the door to the library], Huh? ,[he sees SpongeBob still moonwalking on the treadmill, until it explodes. He then comes to a complete stop], My treadmill! 
,SpongeBob:, You know, Squidward, exercising's fun and all, but when am I gonna learn some ,dancing,? ,[Squidward grunts angrily crushing his tentacles], 
,Squidward:, All right! You wanna learn some ,dancing,?! I'll show you dancing! ,[he starts a record on his record player], You know what gets people going? Ribbons! ,[Pulls out a ribbon. SpongeBob is seated in a chair. He then starts twirling the ribbon], 
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! 
,Squidward:, Now, do just as I did. ,[SpongeBob runs up to take the ribbon], 
,SpongeBob:, Like this? ,[he starts twirling the ribbon, cracks it like a whip, and changes it into a helicopter, a dinosaur and a mermaid. Squidward spits out his drink. The mermaid picks SpongeBob up and flies him around the room. He then approaches Squidward, who snatches the ribbon out of his hand, throws it on the floor, and stomps on it angrily. SpongeBob frowns as Squidward jump stomps on the ribbon, eventually putting a hole in the floor, crashing below. SpongeBob does the exact same thing.], 
,SpongeBob:, Like that, Squidward? ,[we now see SpongeBob with a bowtie on. Squidward puts a hat on him and hands him a cane.], 
,Squidward:, Okay, try this. ,[as he stretches his bowtie], It's simple. ,[he throws the cane], And a real showstopper. ,[he catches the cane], Pay close attention. ,[Squidward squats for a second. He starts marching in place while twirling his cane. He throws the cane up, slides, and catches the cane in his other hand.], Now you. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[as Squidward approaches him], Gee, I don't know. Are you sure? 
,Squidward:, ,[he points at SpongeBob], You want to ace the audition, don't you? 
,SpongeBob:, Well, yes, but-- 
,Squidward:, Then do it! ,[he sticks his cane at SpongeBob's nose. He takes it off as SpongeBob walks away. He looks at his cane, throws it and catches it. He gets excited. We see Squidward frowning for a moment. SpongeBob starts squatting. He then starts twirling his cane, throws it while still twirling, and catches it in his other hand. SpongeBob continues to twirl his cane as he shows his happy face at us. He hits the cane on the ground, and then hits Squidward's nose. He takes off the top of the cane, revealing flowers. He put the flowers on Squidward's hat. Squidward sucks them up with a vacuum as SpongeBob continues to dance with his cane. He then jumps rope with the cane and we see Squidward's eye twitching. As SpongeBob continues to dance with the cane, we see different colored backgrounds. At one point, he pretends that he's horse-riding with the cane. He then uses the cane as an acrobat's swinging bar and flies away. We see Squidward frowning for a moment, walks up to SpongeBob, still dancing. But before he can do anything, SpongeBob whacks the cane on his face, revealing a huge blister. SpongeBob then makes more SpongeBobs appear with his fingers. They all are dancing before Squidward literally tears up the act.], Enough! Listen, you pea-brain, we are gonna keep working on your routine until you get it right! ,[he pokes SpongeBob in the eye], And I don't care how long it takes! Now, watch closely. ,[the eyeball pops right back out, now Squidward does a move], And a-one... ,[he does another move], And a-two... ,[he then jumps in the air, shakes his legs and then lands], And aha! You think you can handle that? 
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir. 
,Squidward:, Then go and practice it, and don't stop until you've done exactly as I did. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[he starts repeating the dance as Squidward did it], And a-one, and a-two, and a-- ,[he falls on his butt], No. ,[he gets up and tries again], And a-one, and a-two, and a-- ,[he falls on his face and gets up], No. 
,Squidward:, Remember, don't stop till you've done it right. ,[he slams the door], 
,SpongeBob:, Right, Squidward. ,[he tries the dance again], And a-one, and a-two, and a-- ,[he falls on his head and gets up], Nope. ,[as it switches from night to day, we hear SpongeBob continuously thudding. Squidward gets up from his bed, yawning.], 
,Squidward:, ,[he smacks his lips and then scratches his head. He then sighs], Better go check on the little yellow sea-monkey's progress. ,[he takes his sleeping hat off and goes into the room, now with his dancing suit on], Well, SpongeBob, have you learned the moves? 
,SpongeBob:, ,[he's now really tired], And a-one, and a-two, and a-- ,[he falls on his back], 
,Squidward:, ,[looking down at SpongeBob], Aw, come on, now. After all I've done for you? We've got one day, SpongeBob. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[as he gets up], Oh, you're right. 
,Squidward:, ,[as he claps his hands], Let's go, let's go! We're burning daylight. ,[we see a montage of Squidward instructing SpongeBob the dance that he did. An alarm clock goes by; at one point, Squidward pulls out one of his nosehairs. A tired SpongeBob also passes by a few times, the last time with his eyes closed. Scene cuts to the outside of Squidward's house, and then back inside.], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[he tries the dance again], And a-one, and a-two, and a-oof! ,[he lands perfectly, just as Squidward did; speaking slightly slurred], Is that okay, Squidward? 
,Squidward:, I'm still not convinced. ,[he points at SpongeBob], Do it again. ,[SpongeBob kneels away and does the dance again, this time with his eyes closed], 
,SpongeBob:, And a-one, and a-two... ,[he attempts the final move, but he opens his eyes halfway and starts shaking and we see Squidward with his evil smile. SpongeBob stops, closes his eyes and mumbles ""a-ond and a-two and a...and...: He shakes back and forth once more and then falls asleep; he snores loudly once. He falls to the ground and snores loudly again. Squidward claps repeatedly over SpongeBob as SpongeBob continues snoring loudly. He mumbles ""and a-"" softly and then snores loudly once more.], 
,Squidward:, Good night, sweet prince, and hello, stardom for yours truly. ,[he evil laughs. The scene now focuses at the auditorium, where dance auditions are being held.],
,Twin Sisters:, ,[singing], We're tiny, we're cuddly, we're bubbly, wubbly, huggly. ,[they hug each other], 
,Talent Agent:, ,[as she claps her hands], That was very cute, girls. ,[the little girls both gasp with excitement], In fact, it's too cute. You're out. ,[she points behind her], 
,Twin Sisters:, ,[talking simultaneously as they walk down the stairs], I told you it was a stupid idea... and I hate you, too! 
,Talent Agent:, ,[as she looks at her clipboard], Let's see who's next. Hmm... ,[she mumbles], SpongeBob SquarePants. Oh, SpongeBob SquarePants! ,[she looks behind her in the empty auditorium], SpongeBob?! I guess he's not here. It's too bad, he was good. But who could replace a dancer of such high-caliber?
,Squidward:, ,[now in the auditorium], Only ,the, best dancer in Bikini Bottom. 
,Talent Agent:, Really? ,[as she points to herself], Well, I'll be ,the, judge of that. 
,Squidward:, ,[he starts laughing and then jumps on the stage], Observe a true master at work. ,[he starts doing a dance where he only swings his legs back and forth. He then stops.], 
,Talent Agent:, Oh, sweet sassafras! Do mine eyes deceive me? That was the greatest routine since the greatest thing since sliced bread dancing routine! ,[she gets on the stage], Congratulations! ,[she shakes Squidward's hand], You got the gig! 
,Squidward:, Oh, baby, I knew it! ,[he puts his hands on her shoulders], You won't be sorry you made this decision. 
,Talent Agent:, I don't think you'll be sorry either, because you'll be dancing in... ,[we see Squilliam], ...Squilliam's show! 
,Squidward:, ,[studders], Squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squidawa! 
,Squilliam:, Well, don't just stand there! Get the sand out of your leotard and dance for me, nitwit. ,[we see Squidward for a moment looking around. Squilliam taps his conductor stick a few times and then picks up a boom box. He starts playing it.], Dance! ,[Squidward starts dancing to upbeat ukulele music for a few seconds before getting smacked in the face with a glove], Not like that, kelp for brains! You call that dancing? Do it like this! ,[he puts his hands together], Here I go! ,[he then does the exact dance as SpongeBob did at the beginning of the episode], Who put you on the planet? Ugh! Now, do it exactly as I did, and don't stop till you get it right! ,[he touches Squidward's nose], And I don't care how long it takes! ,[he then starts dancing the dance that Squilliam and SpongeBob did. We see SpongeBob now seated in the auditorium with Patrick], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[he puts his elbow on him], I was up for that part. ,[he drinks his drink and Patrick eats his popcorn. Cuts to black, episode ends],

"SpongeBob:, ,[Gary is on his exercise wheel], Exercise time is over, Gary. ,[takes Gary off his wheel], We don't want you getting too thin. ,[holds up a green, squishy ball], Here, boy. Fetch! ,[throws it and Gary goes after it but at a slow pace. SpongeBob checks his watch and goes sits on a chair and takes out the newspaper to read. Morning arrives and SpongeBob is asleep in the chair. Gary crawls up to SpongeBob and spits out the ball],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[sees the ball on the ground],  Good job, Gary! ,[He jumps to Gary], I love you, Gary! ,[He starts scratching Gary], Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary! ,[Gary climbs up on SpongeBob, tickling him], Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha! ,[Patrick comes through the door],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
,SpongeBob:, For what?
,Patrick:, The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend! ,[shows his jellyfishing net off until he brakes something and blushes with embarrassment], So, you ready or what?
,SpongeBob:, That was this weekend? ,[He looks up at Gary who's still crawling all over him trying to tickle him], I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
,[There's a knock on the door. Squidward is seen outside. The door opens, but the first thing Squidward sees is Gary on SpongeBob's head. He looks down at SpongeBob and reveals a pair of underwear.],
,Squidward:, Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
,Squidward:, What's a Gary?
,SpongeBob:, Not a Gary... Gary. He's my pet snail. ,[shows Gary to Squidward], Say hello! ,[Gary is drooling a lot],
,Squidward:, Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
,SpongeBob:, I love Gary!
,Squidward:, Well, I don't. Get somebody else. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. ,[Squidward stops],
,Squidward:, Go away? ,[walks in reverse back to SpongeBob's Pineapple], You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
,SpongeBob:, Actually, a three day weekend.
,Squidward:, As in, not here for three days?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
,Patrick:, Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
,Squidward:, I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
,SpongeBob:, You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk... ,[SpongeBob explains the daily routine with Gary, but Squidward is busy thinking of how much fun he'll have with SpongeBob & Patrick away],
,Squidward:, Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.
,SpongeBob:, Let me show you how to feed him. ,[opens a cabinet with six barrels of Gary's food], The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
,Squidward:, Sure it's enough? ,[bus drives up to the pineapple with other jellyfishers inside],
,Group:, Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
,Patrick:, The bus is here! The bus is here! ,[crashes through the wall and through the bus leaving his starfish shape through each hole], C'mon, SpongeBob!
,Group:, Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
,Squidward:, ,[pushing SpongeBob out of the house], Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye-bye.
,SpongeBob:, Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
,Squidward:, I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
,SpongeBob:, Gary.
,Squidward:, Right, yeah, right. ,[bus drives off], Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers! ,[laughs with joy], They're gone! ,[runs inside his Easter Island Head. Gary peeks his eyes out the window],
,Gary:, Meow.
,Squidward:, ,[comes out with shorts on and his nose with sunscreen on it and a chair. Unfolds the chair and sits on it], This is going to be the best three days of my life. ,[sighs and lays back with a sun reflector in front of him], I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob. ,[The time card ""3 Days Later"" appears, and now Squidward is badly sunburned, The bus comes back as the group is chanting ""jellyfishing""], Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me. ,[Squidward sees Gary through the window. Gary groans. Squidward's sunburn drains], ,[screams], The snail! I forgot the snail! ,[runs inside the pineapple where Gary is old and withered on the floor. Squidward takes him inside to the kitchen], I've got to do something. ,[takes all the barrels of food and puts it in his bowl], Okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here. ,[throws the food at Gary trying to get him to eat it], ,[Gary lip syncing what Squidward's saying],: Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat! You've gotta finish this food!
,SpongeBob:, See you later, Patrick.
,Squidward:, Come on, eat! Eat! Eat! ,[SpongeBob gets his house key out. Squidward has to decide about the food], Ohh...
,SpongeBob:, ,[sticks the key in the hole and opens the door], Gary! I'm home!
,Squidward:, ,[greets SpongeBob with a head full of Gary's food that he ate], Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! What are you doing here? ,[Squidward swallows all the food],
,Squidward:, Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
,SpongeBob:, What a great friend you are, Squidward.
,Squidward:, So, uhh, well, see you. Goodbye.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Squidward. ,[Gary crawls to SpongeBob, still old and wrinkly], I can always count on you. ,[Gary moans and SpongeBob screams], Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! ,[Squidward frowns ‘cause he can't leave. Later, the doctors snail-mobile is in front of the pineapple],
,Purple Doctorfish:, Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Purple Doctorfish:, This is definitely a snail.
,SpongeBob:, I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?
,Purple Doctorfish:, Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. ,[hands the shot to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Aren't you going to do it?
,Purple Doctorfish:, Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish. ,[doctor leaves. Squidward runs after him],
,Squidward:, Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
,SpongeBob:, Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
,Squidward:, Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... ,[Gary moans and coughs badly],
,SpongeBob:, Gary!
,Squidward:, Okay, okay, I'll do it. ,[takes the shot],
,SpongeBob:, Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady. ,[Squidward tries to give Gary the shot but SpongeBob pulls him away], Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. ,[Squidward keeps trying but gets the same result every time],
,Squidward:, Will you hold him still? ,[snail plasma shot in SpongeBob's nose],
,SpongeBob:, Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
,Squidward:, Well, you made me do it.
,SpongeBob:, What's going to happen to me?
,Squidward:, Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
,Squidward:, I'm telling you, its all in your head. ,[Gary crawls to his water bowl to get a drink. After drinking the water, he gargles, clears his throat, and meows normally again.],
,Squidward:, He just needed water?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary, you're better! ,[hugs him],
,Squidward:, Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
,Squidward:, Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. ,[closes door],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
,Gary:, ,[jumps up], Meow! ,[SpongeBob pours food into Gary's bowl, but decides to see what it tastes like. He likes it so he eats all of it. Then walks to Gary with the empty bowl],
,SpongeBob:, Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself. ,[burps], Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! ,[SpongeBob begins to walk out of the kitchen. His feet make loud pounding noises as they hit the floor, and he begins to go slower and slower. Soon Gary is going faster than he is.],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, you're getting a ,[voice slows, lowers], lot faster! ,[SpongeBob sluggishly walks into the bathroom, and Gary follows him. He looks in the mirror, and his voice echoes as he speaks.],
,SpongeBob:,  Look at me. Never better. ,[He yelps as dramatic music begins to play in the background. His head begins to throb, and his pores begin to grow and shrink, before returning to normal.], I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! ,[What he doesn't realize is that the worst is yet to come. His eyes bug out of his head, causing him to yell. The camera rotates around so we can get a side view of SpongeBob. He blinks, and his eyes briefly pop back into his head and return to normal. But this relief only lasts for about half a second. Then, his eyes bulge out even farther than before, and it looks very unnatural. They bulge for a while, and then they begin to transform, taking the shape and form of snail's eyes, with stalks. The sight causes SpongeBob's jaw to drop, and he screams louder. SpongeBob stares in the bathroom mirror at his brand-new eyestalks, which now have skin and eyelids around them. He turns to Gary.],
,SpongeBob:,  Gary... I'm fine! ,[But SpongeBob is not fine. Gary watches in horror as his owner falls onto his hands and knees, straining in pain.],
,SpongeBob:,  ,[in so much pain that he is barely comprehensible], Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see. ,[grunts and strains as his hand and arm slowly retract into his sleeve, which then pops off and bounces away], That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway!, [Then, SpongeBob's feet and legs retract into his pants.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs nervously], Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes! ,[his body shortens up like a snail and he screams], I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee ,[he loses the ability to, ,talk and completes his snail transformation], ow!
,Squidward:, ,[in his bed], I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary. ,[a knock is heard on the door and the doorbell rings], Who could that be? As if I didn't already know. ,[Squidward walks to the door and opens it], SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just fi-i-i... ,[SpongeBob is a fully breaded snail now],
,SpongeBob:, Meow!
,Squidward:, ,[screams],
,SpongeBob:, Meow! Meow. ,[Squidward touches SpongeBob's left eye and it curls up],
,Squidward:, ,[screams and runs back inside shutting the door],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done? ,[picks up the snail plasma shot], It's all your fault. ,[throws it away], Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, Meow! ,[Squidward screams and puts boards on his door. Turns around and SpongeBob is at his window], Meow. Meow. ,[Squidward screams], Meow! ,[Squidward puts more boards on his window, but SpongeBob squeezes through the boards holes], Meow. Meow. ,[Squidward screams and runs into his closet],
,Squidward:, None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail! ,[SpongeBob squeezes in from under the door, and meows. Squidward screams and runs through his door, SpongeBob meows, Squidward runs up and down his ceiling while SpongeBob keeps meowing at him. Outside, his house is bouncing from side to side until it flipped on its side completely. Everything is broken and torn inside. Squidward sits up, but is injected with the snail plasma through his nose],
,Squidward:, Uh-oh! ,[now SpongeBob, Squidward, and Gary are on a fence singing ""Blow the Man Down""],
,Gary:, Meow ,[B♭],, meow ,[C],, meow ,[B♭],, meow ,[G],, meow ,[E♭], .

"Mr. Krabs:, Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.
,Mailman:, Sorry. No check. But I've got this. ,[gives Mr. Krabs a bottle and walks away],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh? ,[reading], Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard! ,[not reading. Gasp!], Grandpa Readbeard comin’ bla, bla, bla!
,SpongeBob:, I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, ""The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws."" And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.
,[He flashes back to when he was a baby. His grandpa was babysitting him on his pirate ship],
,Baby Mr. Krabs:, ,[chewing a rattle],
,Grandpa Redbeard:, ,[fighting pirate skeletons], One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here.
,Mr. Krabs:, So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....
,Crew member:, Aaarrrrr!
,Mr. Krabs:, And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.
,Crew members:, ,[lined up to get paid],
,Mr. Krabs:, I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. ‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Aaarrr, if it ain't me pirate grandson.
,Young Mr. Krabs:, Well, actually, Grandpa,...I just sold...
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Ya know how proud it makes me to see me only grandson continuin' in the family business.
,Young Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, uh, Grandpa...
,Grandpa Redbeard:, And I'll be keepin' me eye on yer career to see how you progress. Just remember, the only rule in the Pirate's Code of Honor is: Never tell a lie.
,[The flashback ends],
,Mr. Krabs:, For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!
,SpongeBob:, Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.
,SpongeBob:, We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah.
,[An hour or two pass],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate. ,[puts a bandana on Squidward], I want you to talk like a pirate.
,SpongeBob:, Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!
,Mr. Krabs:, But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate. ,[smells Patrick], Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!

,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.

,Mr. Krabs:, There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, apparently me cabin is haunted as well.
,Grandpa Redbeard:, ,[picks up a hair net], What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship? Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew. This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, just a sec. ,[turns a video projector on], Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack! ,[The video projector shows a kraken emerging from the water],

,Pearl:, Dad! ,Dad!,
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Now it's even more angry!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry! I have it under control! ,[jumps off the ship],
,Pearl:, ,Daddy!,
,Mr. Krabs:, Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!
,Pearl:, What's with the lame outfit?
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Oh, never mind that! ,[pushes Pearl away], Just go home. ,[climbs back up the ship],
,Grandpa Redbeard:, ,[breaks a cardboard wave],
,Mr. Krabs:, I bet you're wondering about that.
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Ar, you're darn tootin' I am!
,Patrick:, ,[spits on Grandpa Redbeard],
,Mr. Krabs:, Do you mind?
,Grandpa Redbeard:, What kinda ship are you runnin' here?
,Mr. Krabs:, Just a second. ,[removes the wind record from the record player and throws it on Grandpa Redbeard's nose],
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Arrrrrrrrrrrr! Arrrrrrrrrrrr!
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.
,Grandpa Redbeard:, I've smelled sticky things, but nothin' smells stckier than a lie! The code that all pirates live by, you knows what it is, don't ya?
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course I do, Granddad.
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Well, then, say it!

He destroys the whole ship, leaving the KK standing], All of it! All a lie!
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Krabby Patties: $2.00. Krusty Combo: $3.99! Coral Bits: $1.95?!
,Mr. Krabs:, You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.
,Grandpa Redbeard:, Fail, me boy?! Ha, ha, ha! Why, I couldn't be more proud. Look at yer ludicrous prices! Now, that's ,real, piracy. Ya done good, boy-o!

,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Patrick, it's very scary-looking and spooky.
,Patrick:, It looks like fun, I'm going to check it out ,[runs to houseboat],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, wait for me! ,[follows Patrick],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs and tries to get up to the houseboat, but can't], Hey, SpongeBob, can you give me a boost?
,[Patrick gets up on top of SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, A little to the left. ,[SpongeBob moves to the left. Gets up to the boat], A little help? ,[SpongeBob lifts him up],
,SpongeBob:, Hurry up, lazy-bones! ,[SpongeBob gets up to the boat],
,Patrick:, Wow. Look at this place! It's so cheesy! Check out this lame doorknob.
,[SpongeBob looks at skeleton doorknob, which shrieks at him. SpongeBob laughs nervously],
,Patrick:, Let's check out inside.
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh, come on, don't be such a baby! ,[Opens door, to which SpongeBob follows him], Wow, so lame!
,[Thunder clap is heard],
,Patrick:, ,[Sees plate of eyeballs and picks up one], Nice attention to detail, though. ,[Puts eyeball back],
,[SpongeBob notices the eyeballs blink, to which he runs away],
,Patrick:, Huh. So not scary!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Looks at picture of flowers], Hey, this is a nice picture! ,[Snakes come out of the picture and go into SpongeBob, to which he screams and scatters around],
,Patrick:, Did you say something, SpongeBob?
,[Snakes go back into picture],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, check this out!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I'll be right there!
,Patrick:, Even the spiders are fake! I wish something would... pop out of a closet! Like a big, hairy hand! ,[Door opens and a big, hairy hand comes out and takes SpongeBob to attack him], That would be scary! ,[SpongeBob screams from far away], But this place is too low budget for that! ,[Hand returns SpongeBob], It would be cool, though, wouldn't it?
,SpongeBob:, ,[shaking], Yeah, that'd be ,[gulps], neato. ,[hears scary music], Patrick, where is that music coming from?
,Patrick:, I think it's coming from that guy!
,[Shows ghost playing the piano, while a thunder clap is heard],
,Lord Poltergeist:, ,[turns around], Who dares trespass upon me haunted houseboat? ,[Thunder clap is heard. Lord Poltergeist goes over to SpongeBob and Patrick],
,Patrick:, We do!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Aye. And what man or beast might you too be?
,Patrick:, ,[opens Lord Poltergeist's mouth], Look at the attention to detail in his mouth. It's so rotten and slimy. ,[Poltergeist breathes into Patrick's face, turning it rotten], His bad breath is incredible! His hair is very thin, too. It's dirty. ,[sniffs], Eww. It reeks, and check out the workship on the jaw mechanism. ,[moves Poltergeist's jaw up and down], Remarkable-built quality! ,[Lets go of jaw], Obviously a puppet or a robot! Hey, we must be in one of those pizza parlors, with one of those singing animated robots!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Robots? Puppets? Pizza parlors?! ,[gets angry],
,Patrick:, Sing us a song, robot!
,Lord Poltergeist:, What? Sing for ye?
,Patrick:, Oh, whoops! You're right. I almost forgot. You're coin-operated, aren't you? ,[Puts coin into his nose. Poltergeist coughs up coin and looks at it, gripping it tightly],
,Lord Poltergeist:, So you want me to sing ye a shanty, eh?
,Patrick:, Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
,SpongeBob:, Don't put yourself out for us!
,Lord Poltergeist:, And you do not think I'm a real ghost, do ye?
,Patrick:, Nope!
,SpongeBob:, I do, Mr. dead pirate, sir!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Oh, oh, oh, I'll sing ye a song, all right! A song so terrifying, you'll have to believe I'm a ghost! ,[electrocutes SpongeBob and Patrick and laughs],
,Patrick:, This show is going to be so awesome.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs nervously], Yeah, awesome ,[SpongeBob's hand falls off],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Hit it, fingers! ,[Fingers appear and start the music],
,Ghosts:, Yo-ho-ho, yo-hoooooooooooo!
,Patrick:, ,[whispers], They're good!
,Ghosts:, ♪Oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep! Under the waves we like to creep. Creeping in coffins and spider webs as ghostly pillows beneath our heads. Oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep. Under the waves we like to creep. We have black shrouds that look quite neat, but we don't own shoes, ‘cause we have no feet. Ha-ha-ha! ,[Lord Poltergeist shows bones for feet and taps them together], We like to haunt and frighten and scare ‘til you jump right out of your underwear. We like to eat eyes and brains and drink our grog from rusty drains. We don't keep animals like cutesy snails!♪ ,[Lord Poltergeist rips Gary's shell off],
,SpongeBob:, Gary!
,Ghosts:, ♪Our favorite pet's, the cat-o-nine-tails!♪
,Cat:, Meow!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick clap],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Do you believe we're real ghosts now?
,Patrick:, Where's my pizza? What kind of pizza joint are you running anyhow?
,Lord Poltergeist:, Pizza? I'll give you a pizza! ,[Poofs up pizza and gives it to SpongeBob and Patrick],
,Patrick:, That's more like it! ,[Pizza opens to show anchovies on the pizza],
,Anchovies:, Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Anchovies!? ,[Pizza disappears, SpongeBob and Patrick bow], You are real ghosts! You are real ghosts!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Ha-ha-ha-ha! So ye finally believe, eh? Cursed swabs!
,SpongeBob:, We do! We do!
,Patrick:, Oh, please don't kill me with your death ray eyes, Mr. Ghost Robot! ,[Puts SpongeBob in front of him], Take my best friend instead! He's lived a full life!
,[Patrick cowers in fear as SpongeBob is surprised by his act],
,Lord Poltergeist:, ,[Looks at the cowering Patrick], ,[sarcastically], Eh, great friend you have here!
,SpongeBob:, Why have you come to Bikini Bottom, oh mighty dead person, sir?
,Lord Poltergeist:, Eh, that's funny you should ask. Usually, when I come to town, it's to terrify the population and enslave their souls in eternal torment! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah, but this time we just blew a head gasket.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I didn't know you ghosts had gaskets in your heads!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Not us, you imbecile! Our engine room broke down. ,[opens engine room and coughs], Hey, Charlie, you got the busted head gasket out yet?
,Charlie:, Here you go, boss! ,[head gasket melts], Looks like we need a new one! ,[Poltergeist grabs head gasket],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Say, maybe you two morons... Um, fine gentlemen, could pick up a new one for us!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gulps], Uh, uh, us?
,Lord Poltergeist:, Yes, you! And just as a little incident to make you return ,[lifts up SpongeBob and Patrick],, I'll take your souls as deposit!
,[Poltergeist grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and puts their souls into glass bottles. Poltergeist poofs up a treasure chest and picks a doubloon from it, giving to SpongeBob],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Here's a shiny doubloon to buy a new gasket. Succeed and maybe you'll get another doubloon! If you aren't back in 24 hours, your souls are mine and you'll be part of my ghastly crew, um, ,[goes over to check calendar],, let's see here, three weeks from Thursday... forever!
,SpongeBob:, Um, can we run screaming in horror from your ship now, Mr. Ghost Captain, sir?
,Lord Poltergeist:, Oh, why certainly!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, after you!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick leave, screaming in horror],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Such a polite lad!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick keep on running, but stop to get ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, One scoop, please.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick have ice cream, then continue running and screaming until crashing into the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Ghosts, ghosts, a haunted houseboat!
,Patrick:, ,[muffled with tongue stretched out], Houseboat full of ghosts!
,[SpongeBob gets himself stuck in Patrick's tongue],
,SpongeBob:, Eww, eww, eww, eww!
,[Patrick's tongue gets SpongeBob and Patrick stuck],
,Frank:, Hey, those guys are insane!
,[Customers run out of the restaurant],
,Mr. Krabs:, What in Neptune's name is going on? ,[gasps], Come back! ,[cries], SpongeBob, what in the blue barnacles, are you up to?!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, it was awful! We just had a spooky encounter of the ghostly kind!
,Mr. Krabs:, You had a what?
,SpongeBob:, We were just minding our own business and a haunted houseboat fell out of the sky!
,Patrick:, ,[muffled], And it was full of ghosts! The really, real kind, not fake kind!
,[Mr. Krabs puts Patrick's tongue back in place, knocking him down],
,SpongeBob:, The captain of the ghost gave us this doubloon and told us to buy him a new head gasket! And then, he took our souls and he put them in bottles and he said he's going to turn us into ghosts if we don't get that head gasket! You gotta help us, Mr. Krabs! I feel so empty without my soul!
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you say doubloon? ,[Grabs doubloon], Let me see that! Hmm, looks somewhat authentic ,[sniffs doubloon], Smells real enough! ,[Bites doubloon, which knocks out his tooth. Goes to Frank's car and steals his head gasket],
,Frank:, Hey!
,[Mr. Krabs comes back with head gasket],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, let's go see those ghosts, fellers! We'll catch 'em and take their gold!
,SpongeBob:, But Mr. Krabs! We don't know the first thing about ghost hunting!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick hear a disturbing noise, which is Sandy's new device],
,Sandy:, I'll catch your ghosts for ya! It'll be easy with my new fangled critter-detector-catcher gizmo!
,Squidward:, And you just happened to bring that with you... to the Krusty Krab?
,Sandy:, Sure, I was looking for milkshake gremlins!
,[Sandy scans milkshake for gremlins],
,Sandy:, Nope, none in there!
,Mr. Krabs:, Great, then it's settled, let's go catch us some ghost gold!
,Squidward:, What makes you think I have any interest in your delusional adventurism?
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, Squidward! Think about what those treasures can do for the Krusty Krab, eh? Huh? Why, I can buy you that break room you've always wanted!
,[Squidward imagines, sitting near a microwave, waiting for his burrito to be done],
,Squidward:, Okay, I'm in!
,Mr. Krabs:, Super! Let's go catch us some treasure! So what do you say, SpongeBob! Are ya ready!
,SpongeBob:, I'll go, but just to get my soul back.
,Mr. Krabs:, Who needs a soul when you're filthy rich?
,[Episode skips to second part of episode, which cuts to the haunted houseboat],
,SpongeBob:, So here it is. Pretty creepy, huh?
,Sandy:, This place looks like it hasn't been lived in for years.
,Patrick:, Four years? Gotta be longer than that.
,Squidward:, I don't see any signs of ghosts ,[walks over to painting of a man with a pitchfork and woman standing together], Nothing here but a bunch of tacky, old furniture, and boring, representational art. ,[Man in picture comes alive and eats woman's head], Huh?
,SpongeBob:, Look, Mr. Krabs! The doubloons!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Ha-ha-ha ,[Mr. Krabs licks the doubloons in celebration],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I wouldn't touch that if I were you! That gold probably has ghost germs all over it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob! There's no such things as germs. ,[grabs a sack and puts doubloons in it], Heads up, Squidward! ,[Krabs throws bag to Squidward, which hits him in the head], Hey, Patrick, think fast!
,Patrick:, Think? ,[Bag of doubloons hits Patrick],
,Mr. Krabs:, All righty, then. Let's get while the getting's good! Ooh! ,[Notices a doubloon is left behind], Looks like I missed one! Uh... it seems to be stuck... uuuuuuhhhh... ,[pulls out Lord Poltergeist and screams],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Who dares touch me gold?
,SpongeBob:, It's just us, Mr. Ghost Captain, sir. We brought the replacement gasket you asked for. So if it's not too much trouble, do you think you could give us our souls back... now... maybeee.
,Lord Poltergeist:, A deal's a deal and I'm a man of me word. Here you go, square one.
,[SpongeBob fills up his body with his soul],
,SpongeBob:, Aah. That hits the spot!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Think fast, pink one!
,Patrick:, Again?
,[Bottle of orange soda hits Patrick in the head],
,Patrick:, My soul. ,[Licks it off the floor],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Har-har-har. Those weren't your souls. Those were just a couple of old orange sodas that have been sitting in the sun too long!
,Patrick:, Well, I thought mine seemed a little flat.
,SpongeBob:, But what about our real souls?
,Lord Poltergeist:, Eh, I never had 'em. Everyone knows you can't hold onto a wild soul. Well, now that that's settled, there's still a little matter of... ,[Poltergeist notices Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick taking off with his gold], Me gold! Stop right there! No one touches me booty and gets away with it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Pfttttt! You ghosts don't scare me! You're nothing but thin air! Grab your sacks and follow me, boys! ,[Krabs opens a door, which leads to the Void, which he is sucked into], Noooooooooooooooooooo!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Ha-har-har-har. Welcome to the Void! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
,[Squidward makes babbling noises and is sucked into the Void],
,Patrick:, Get me out of here!
,Squidward:, Nooooooooooooooooooo!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Ha-har-har-har-har! ,[Poltergeist sucks in Patrick],
,Patrick:, Nooooooooooooooooo!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. So this is limbo. Well, at least I have a sack full of doubloons to spend eternity with. Uh-oh. Gotta use the can! ,[Krabs notices that there's a port-a-potty nearby], Ooh. There's a bit of luck. A portable potty. What's this here? ""Insert doubloon?"" Nooooooooooooo!
,[Mr. Krabs' image fades away and changes to Patrick],
,Patrick:, Wow. This void sure is relaxing! ,[A doughnut shows up on Patrick's head], Hey! I've got a doughnut on my head! Come here, you. ,[Patrick's head stretches], Hey! Get back here! ,[Patrick's head stretches more and he screams], Why is this happening to me?,[Doughnut comes to life],
,Doughnut:, Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Welcome to your worst nightmare ,[Patrick screams in terror], Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmm? Hey, stupid? Don't you wanna eat me?
,Patrick:, Not really. I don't like plain doughnuts.
,Doughnut:, Well, what kind do you like?
,Patrick:, Um, I like sprinkles!
,Doughnut:, Aah. Voila!
,Patrick:, No, chocolate! No, a bagel! No-no-no-no, pancakes! No-no-no...
,Doughnut:, Hey, pick one, so we can get on with your eternal torment!
,Patrick:, Okay, okay! Man, you're pushy! How about... a Krabby Patty? With pickles! And ketchup! Wait, wait, wait, I know! I want... a plain doughnut!
,Doughnut:, Nooooooooooooooooooo!
,[Scene cuts to Squidward in the Void],
,Squidward:, Oh, great. I wonder what my vision of eternal suffering will be! ,[A large, ghost version of SpongeBob is shown with Squidward on its nose], Of course!
,Giant Demonic SpongeBob:, Hiiii, neighbor! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
,Squidward:, I guess this is the part where I start screaming. ,[screams],
,[Ghost SpongeBob continues to laugh as the scene cuts to Lord Poltergeist laughing evilly],
,Sandy:, Hey, corpse breath! You better let my friends out of there if you know what's good for ya!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Ha-ha-ha... And if I don't, what'll ye do about it, me bubble-headed lassy?
,Sandy:, Oh, you'll be laughing out the other side of your tombstone once you've had a taste of my ghost-catcher!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Oh! The big chipmunk's gonna get us! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
,[Sandy turns on ghost-catcher and release Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks, lassie. Now, let's just get this here bag of doubloons back to the Krusty Krab!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Not so fast! That there booty be mine! ,[Poltergeist sucks bag into treasure chest],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, you thieving bilge rat! I stole this gold fair and square! ,[Mr. Krabs and Poltergeist beat up each other trying to get possession of treasure chest, which flies into the air],
,SpongeBob:, I got it! ,[Treasure chest crushes SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me gold!
,Lord Poltergeist:, You mean my gold!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that's funny! Hmm, this chest says it belongs to the Flying Dutchman!
,Sandy:, The Flying Dutchman?! You ain't afraid he's gonna want it back?
,Lord Poltergeist:, Nah, nah! We used to be part of the Dutchman's crew. We stole his gold hundreds of years ago! But the Dutchman hasn't found us yet. And he never will!
,[Cannon shoots into the haunted houseboat],
,Flying Dutchman:, Avast!
,Lord Poltergeist and Sandy:, ,[look out the door], Huh?
,Flying Dutchman:, Heave to... and prepare to be boarded by the Flying Dutchman!
,Lord Poltergeist:, The Dutchman! How did he track us down? Unless, thar be a snitch aboard!
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding a phone], It is my civic duty to report stolen property!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Why, you scurvy little scum-scrubber! You've ruined everything!
,Squidward:, Welcome to my world.
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[angrily shouts], Avast there, you scurvy thieving barnacle bass!
,Lord Poltergeist:, ,[nervously], Dutchman! Boy, am I glad we finally found you!
,Flying Dutchman:, So, it be me old first mate who stole me gold and me crew!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Stole your gold? We just went out to get pizza!
,Flying Dutchman:, Um, that was 300 years ago!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Um, we got lost? But we've been looking for ye ever since... to give ye back your treasure!
,Flying Dutchman:, Me booty! Well, maybe I misjudged you fellas! I'm sorry I was so cross with ya! ,[Lord Poltergeist sails away with the treasure], Why, you treacherous sea devils! When I'm done with you, you... ,[Lord Poltergeist runs over the Dutchman and flies away], Okay, now I'm a little bit peeved!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Ha-ha-ha! Eh, that Dutchman was always a sap!
,Sandy:, Frog whiskers! The Dutchman's on our tail!
,Ghost:, Report! The engine's on fire, sir! ,[Engine explodes],
,Sandy:, The Dutchman's gaining on us!
,Lord Poltergeist:, We're going down! Brace for impact! ,[Everyone screams and boat collapses to the ground],
,Flying Dutchman:, Don't go anywhere, kiddies! Cause you're about to be cursed like you've never been cursed before!
,SpongeBob:, Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that!
,Flying Dutchman:, Observe! ,[Dutchman takes out his eyeball and transforms into a missile, launching himself at the Poltergeist's ship], Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! ,[Missile destroys the ship], Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
,[Title card ""Later in the Void"" is shown, cutting to a scene in the Void],
,Lord Poltergeist:, Welcome to the Kursed Krab! How may we serve you this eternity?
,Skeleton:, I just need to use the bathroom!
,Lord Poltergeist:, Aargh, it's right over there.
,Patrick:, Here's your milkshake, Sandy. ,[Gremlin pops out of the milkshake],
,Sandy:, Got ya, you little gremlin!
,Doughnut:, And what would you like, sir?
,Ghost:, I want a plain doughnut! ,[Eats doughnut off Patrick's head, to which he is given a bill],
,Mr. Krabs:, How's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Everyone's paying with bones.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, money's money!
,Squidward:, No, I mean actual bones.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. Those must be worth something down here.
,SpongeBob:, Order up, Squidward! Everybody hold onto something! It's time to flip the patties! Hit it!
,[Giant Demonic SpongeBob laughs and flips the Krusty Krab, everybody screams as it flips backwards. Giant SpongeBob turns into the Flying Dutchman, ending the episode],

,Flying Dutchman:, What are you trying to say?
,SpongeBob:, Eeeh.
,Flying Dutchman:, I know when I'm washed up. I've been doing the same material for years! Scaring is a young man's game. It's time to give up the ghost; no pun intended.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.

,Fish:, Mind if I test it out? ,[hops onto the mattress], Yeah, this does feel comfortable. ,[doorbell rings],
,Mattress Salesman:, Would you excuse me for a moment? ,[The fish on the mattress falls asleep as the Flying Dutchman tries to scare him. First he scares normally, then scares by opening his mouth to reveal a skeleton. Nothing is working],

,SpongeBob:, Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
,Flying Dutchman:, Maybe I just need a break. Take some time off, you know?
,SpongeBob:, Sure, relax a little.
,Flying Dutchman:, Maybe stay with a friend for a while. On a comfy couch in a pineapple. Just for a little while longer? 'Til I get back on my feet?

,SpongeBob:, Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now. ,[SpongeBob puts a tape into the VCR],
,Flying Dutchman:, What in barnacles is it?

,Flying Dutchman:, Let's hit it. ,[The Flying Dutchman, goes through the wall, but SpongeBob does not, smashing into the wall. Inside, Larry the Lobster is lifting weights. Then he looks into the mirror],
,Larry:, Dude, look at your pecks! You're phenomenal! Truly a hard body. Look at those guns. ,[Flying Dutchman attempts to scare him. Larry gasps],
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Now he's got him.
,Larry:, My altissimo dorsi has gone flabby! I gotta get to a rolling machine. ,[leaves],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ah. It's no use, SpongeBob. I can't seem to scare anyone. Maybe people just don't believe in ghosts anymore.
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems! ,[whispers into the Flying Dutchman's ears], ...goblins...guilt trip... ,[scene cuts to Squidward's house where Squidward slips into his bunny slippers and walks to the mirror. When he picks up his powder, it floats by itself and applies itself onto Squidward.],
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[Green fog begins to appear and a voice is heard in the fog],
,Mrs. Tentacles:, Squidward! Squidward!
,Squidward:, What's going on?
,Mrs. Tentacles:, Why haven't you called me?
,Squidward:, Mother?
,Mrs. Tentacles:, Why haven't you called your mother?
,Squidward:, ,[screams], Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.
,Mrs. Tentacles:, Why don't you call me then? Why don't you call me? Why don't you call me? ,[her face melts turning into a clarinet that plays music. The clarinet goes into one of Squidward's ears and out the other, literally],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[through the clarinet], I heard you don't believe in ghosts!
,Squidward:, Ghosts?
,Flying Dutchman:, As in the Flying Dutchman! ,[tosses Squidward against the wall],
,Squidward:, There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing.
,Flying Dutchman:, No such thing as ghosts? No such thing as ghosts?! You don't believe in ghosts?! ,[floor turns into liquid. Another ghost pops up and eats Squidward sending him into a light that spits him back into his house. A giant SpongeBob is sitting there breathing in and out really hard],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob's eyes twist around his head and spiders crawl out and reveal the Flying Dutchman. Flying Dutchman does a trick to think that he is pulling his finger off],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ooh, scary!
,Squidward:, No! No! That's impossible! ,[runs out of his house], Ghosts! Ghosts!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs out of the closet], Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
,Flying Dutchman:, And me confidence, too. Now I feel like I can scare the living criminy out of anybody! All thanks to you, my boy.
,SpongeBob:, And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
,Flying Dutchman:, Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya. ,[flies back up to his ship], Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls. ,[ships sails off. SpongeBob opens the package. A hand grabs him and pulls him in. SpongeBob laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Good Ol' Dutchie!

"',[SpongeBob's alarm sounds, but then it starts to cough and snaps in two. SpongeBob picks it up],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm. Gary, have you been chewing on my alarm clock again? Oh, well. ,[Tries to fix it with tape but it falls over again], Up and at 'em. ,[Jumps out of bed], Eww. Gary, not my slippers, too! Huh, Nasty. ,[Goes into the bathroom and smells his breath], Eurgh. Oral hygiene to the rescue! ,[Reaches into the cabinet for his toothbrush, but Gary is chewing it], What the hey? Come on, Gary! ,[Pulls], Let go! ,[Tickles him], Coochie coochie coo! ,[Gary laughs and lets go], Golly, Gary, what's gotten into you? Are you bored? I'll play with you later. ,[Gary chews the toothpaste tube], Gary! ,[SpongeBob drops him into the bath], Gary, you are a nut. Sheesh!
,Gary:, ,[Chews on a bar of soap], Meow. ,[Cut to SpongeBob at the kitchen table making breakfast],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Pours cereal], That snail sure is acting weird. It's like he's teething again. ,[Pours milk, but it leaks out of the bowl, looks through a hole in it], Hey, hold on a second...Gary, have you been chewing on my bowl?!
,Gary:, ,[Spits a piece of bowl out], Noew.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Gary chews the table], Gary, are you trying to tell me something? Could it be that what you need is a new chew toy? ,[Gary licks him], I thought so. ,[Gary chews his nose], ,[Cut to the pet store],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, I bet they have lots of toys here. Hey, look, there's Patrick! Howdy, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, Gareth.
,SpongeBob:, What are you doing here? You don't have a pet.
,Patrick:, Confidentially, I'm just here for the free samples. ,[Punches a hole in a ,bag of worm food, and eats some], Mmm, you can really taste the gourmet. ,[To the picture of the mascot], Oh, thank you, ma'am, I may consider purchasing this brand for my worms. ,[To SpongeBob], Want some?
,SpongeBob:, No thanks, just had breakfast. We're here to buy Gary a new toy.
,Patrick:, They're on aisle 3, next to the most delicious snail treats. Follow me! ,[Takes one last handful of worm food then leads SpongeBob and Gary to aisle 3], Here they are! Tasty Time snail treats. ,[Eats one],
,SpongeBob:, Well, how about this one? ,[Gives Gary a bone shaped toy. Gary bites it and it deflates.], Okay, how about this? Well? ,[Gives Gary a fire hydrant toy. He squeezes it and squirts water in SpongeBob's face.], Yeah, I don't think so.
,Patrick:, Hey, guys, check this out! ,(Points to a machine), A Pet Point 3000!,
,SpongeBob:, A pet toy that plays with your pet! What do you think, Gary?,
,Gary:, Meh. ,(Slithers away, uninterested),
,Patrick:, It's so futuristic. ,(Presses a button and a laser pointer appears), Look, a red dot! ,(He chases it), Come back here!,
,SpongeBob:, That's brilliant! What will they think of next?,
,Patrick:, I love this thing! Let's turn it up! ,(He does so), Huh? ,(The laser points at his head and starts to burn a hole), Where did it go?,
,SpongeBob:, ,(Pointing), Uh, Patrick?,
,Patrick:, Huh? Oh, there it is. Hey, do you smell something burning? ,(The laser burns right through his head. SpongeBob turns it off. Patrick's brain falls out of the hole and into SpongeBob. SpongeBob blows it out of his nose and puts it back into Patrick's head.),
,SpongeBob:, Here, you might need this. You know, I'm not sure that toy is safe for Gary. Where is Gary, anyway? Gary?, ,(Gary spots a small red ball on top of a pile and slithers up to it. He licks it and then bites it.),
,SpongeBob:, Gary? Gary! ,(Gary drops the ball and SpongeBob picks it up), Hey, where'd you come from? I wonder if Gary would like this ball. Ga- ,(Gary falls on top of him and licks the ball), I guess you do., ,(Cut to SpongeBob and Gary arriving home),
,SpongeBob:, Are you ready to play with your new ball? ,(Takes it out of the bag), Here it is, boy! ,
,Gary:, Meow!,
,SpongeBob:, You want it, boy?,
,Gary:, Meow!,
,SpongeBob:, OK, boy, go and get it! Go and get it! Go and get it! Fetch! ,(Throws it),
,Gary:, Meow. ,(Chases it into the kitchen), ,
,SpongeBob:, OK, Gary, bring it back! ,(Hears squeaking), C'mon, Gary, bring it back. ,(Goes into the kitchen and sees Gary chewing the ball), You're supposed to bring it … back …,(Gary sees SpongeBob staring and moves underneath the table, chewing the ball excessively), Ah well, as long as he's not chewing on my stuff. , ,(Cut to SpongeBob waching TV. He turns it off.), I wonder how Gary's doing? I haven't heard a squeak out of him. ,(Looks in the kitchen), Gary? Hmm, where is that snail? Gary, where are you? ,(Looks in another room), Gary, I- oh, there you are! ,(Sees Gary having a tea party with the ball), Oh, a tea party, cute! Do you mind if I join you? I just love a spot of tea. ,(Sits down), What kind of tea is it? Green tea? Earl gray? Oolong? Slippery elm? ,(Gary puts the ball in a baby carriage and leaves), Gee, I think he likes that ball more than me. ,(Takes a sip of “tea” then spits it out in disgust), Deugh! That is not tea.,
,(Cut to SpongeBob walking into the kitchen. He takes a can a snail food out of the cupboard.),
,SpongeBob:, I know what will get Gary's attention. Good old Slimycan! ,(Opens the can slowly, checking to see if Gary hears and comes running), Here you go, Ga- ,(Notices that Gary isn't there and lets the food slide onto the floor), Darn it, Gary.,
,(Cut to SpongeBob looking for Gary with his food in a bowl.),
,SpongeBob:, Gary, dinner time! Gary! ,(Opens the garage door), Gary? ,(Gary turns around to reveal that he has painted his face red with lipstick to match the ball), OK, that's just creepy. Gary, I think you need to spend some time away from this ball. ,(Gary presses the garage door button and SpongeBob gets lifted to the ceiling), This isn't helping your case. ,(Gary grabs the ball and leaves),
,(Cut to Gary sleeping. SpongeBob walks in.),
,SpongeBob:, Oh, so you've hidden it? ,[Gary tries to sneak away], Oh, no you don't, come here! I bet I know where it is. ,[Flicks open a hatch in Gary's shell and puts his hand in], Hairball. Hairball. Wallet. Darn it, I thought I lost this … and I just cancelled my credit cards! Hairball. Toothbrush. Aha! ,[Pulls the ball out], I knew it! ,[Walks into the bedroom], You'll see. Some time apart will do you good. ,[Launches the ball on top of his dresser], There we go, out of sight, out of mind. I know you're upset now, but wait until tomorrow morning. ,[Gets into bed], Why, you probably won't even remember that old ball. ,[Turns the light off with his feet. The ball rolls to the edge of the dresser, in a red glow, and Gary stares at it.],
,(Cut to the next morning. SpongeBob's alarm sounds, then coughs and falls over.),
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, Gary! I hope you're not still mad at me. Gary? The ball! ,(Notices the ball is missing), I will not tolerate this disobedience, Gary! ,(Walks into the living room), Gary, I'm not playing around, you had better show yourself this instant.,(Something drips onto his nose. He looks up and sees Gary on the ceiling.), OK, get down here! Hm. ,(Walks off screen and back on again, now on the ceiling), Gary, give me that ball. ,(Falls, then hits Gary with a broom), C'mon! Hnn! Get down! ,(Falls. The broom goes through his head and knocks his eyeballs out.), Mother always said, “don't run with the broom”. ,(Gets a chair and a shovel. Stands on the chair and scrapes Gary off the ceiling.),I'll take that! ,(Reaches for the ball. Gary bites his hand.), Gary, how could you! You are going to have to make a choice. It's either me, or the- ,(Gary squeaks the ball), Ball.,(Grabs suitcases), Fine. I hope you two will be very happy. Together. Without me. Goodbye. ,(Leaves, crying),
,(Cut to Gary watching television. His stomach rumbles. He goes into the kitchen.),
,Gary:, ,(in the manner of saying ""SpongeBob""), Meow? ,(Checks the stairs), Meow? ,(Checks the bathroom), Meowow?! ,(Checks the roof) ,Meowow! ,(Goes back into the living room and remembers SpongeBob leaving. What he said was ""translated"" into snail. He then cries, and eyes the ball suspiciously. The ball whistles. Gary tries to leave but the ball stops him.) ,Meow? ,(Acts like he's walking away, then tries to leave again but the ball stops him. Grabs the ball in his mouth and tries to break it. Drops it into the blender, but it shoots out and bounces around the kitchen. Leaves the house in chaos.),
,(Cut to SpongeBob lying underneath a bench), ,
,SpongeBob:, And so it's come to this. No home, no best friend, and sleeping under a bus stop. ,(Nematode pops out of the ground), Hello, little nematode. Will you be my friend? ,(Nematode crawls onto his arm), Atta boy. ,(Crawls into his shirt), Dahaha, that tickles! ,(It re-emerges from his pants with his wallet), Hey, my wallet! Good thing I cancelled those credit cards. ,
,Gary:, ,(On the bench), Meow. ,
,SpongeBob:, Gary! I mean, oh, hey. What are you doing here, waiting for a bus? ,[Gary licks him], Oh, Gary, does this mean you've come to love me more than that chew toy?
,Gary:, Meow. ,
,SpongeBob:, Yippee! ,[Hugs Gary so hard that one of his eye stalks pops through his head], Look, we're closer than ever. ,[Laughs], Come on, Gary, let's go home. ,[Sniffs], Do you smell something burning? ,[In the background, his pineapple explodes in flames. The chew toy is fired to where SpongeBob and Gary are standing.], Hey, look, isn't that your ball? ,[Gary hisses at it, and the episode ends.],
