"[The whirlpool beginning of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy show sequence is shown. First, a slide reading ""The Further Adventures of. Next, a slide saying ""Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy"" and the Action Narrator begins.],
,Narrator:, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy ,[The scene changes to show Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in chains], have been captured by the evil Man Ray. ,[The scene pans out and Man Ray laughs], ...,[The image changes to shown Man Ray holding up a feather], Tickled to the point of wetting themselves ,[The image changes to shown Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the chains. A drip sound is heard], ,[The image changes to show Man Ray pushing a leaver], and sent on a conveyor belt of doom... ,[The image changes to show Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy chained up and heading to the saws at the end of the conveyor belt. Man Ray laughs (the laughter is covered up by the Narrator)], To their watery grave.
,[The images changes to shown just Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in chains heading down the conveyor belt],
,Mermaid Man:, We cannot escape, Barnacle Boy. He's too strong. Like the unbeatable taste of a Krusty Kids meal. ,[Mermaid Man lifts up the meal], ,[The image changes to show Man Ray maniacally laughing. His maniacal laughter stops],
,Man Ray:, The delicious new treat no mortal can resist?
,[The image changes to show Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy heading down the Conveyor belt],
,Barnacle Boy:, Yup.
,Man Ray:, ,[Walks onscreen], Ooh, I just love the little pip-squeak patty, ,[He lifts up the box], small fries, and cold juice product.
,Narrator:, Of course you do, Man Ray. ,[The scene changes back to the whirlpool beginning where ""KK"" can be read. It then goes away and shows the Krabby Kids Meal Box, fries in a container that reads ""KK,"" the Krabby Patty, and a juice box that reads ""100% Juice""], ,[Off-Screen Children saying ""Yay""], Everyone loves the new Krusty Kids Meal. ,[The scene pans out and shows a Mermaid Man Action figure. the background light is turned off to show the toy in the spotlight.], And for a limited time, ,[Off-Screen Someone says ""ooh""], get your free toy inside.
,[The Scene changes back to Man Ray in chains and holding the Krabby Kids Meal Box and a Krabby Patty. The scene pans out to show Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on both sides of him],
,Man Ray:, How can I be evil with flavors this good?
,[Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Man Ray laugh as the words ""Only at the Krusty Krab"" appear on screen] [The scene changes to show Plankton at the Chum Bucket watching the commercial on the TV setting of Karen],
,Plankton:, Krabs calls that a commercial? Who'd fall for that schlock? ,[He walks to over to where his periscope is and pulls it down], Say...,[The scene changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab full of fish], Something is going on over there. 
,[The scene pans in to the interior of the Krusty Krab where a bunch of kids are having fun and playing in the Krusty Krab while watching Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on a big screen] [The image changes to Squidward in a superhero-like costume holding a plate with 6 Kids Meals.],
,Squidward:, The Krusty Krab welcomes... ,[reads the card in his hand], the Tarpon twins' birthday party. Here are your Krabby Kids Meals. ,[all the kids dive in and take Squidward with them],
,Plankton:, ,[The scene returns to the Chum Bucket and Plankton still looking through his periscope], Never trust kids, Squidward. Never trust kids.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[The scene goes back to the Krusty Krab where it shows SpongeBob in a Superhero-like costume (not his Mermaid Man Costume) at the register and Mr. Krabs holding a bag of Money], Gotta hand it to ya, boy. ,[The image changes to just show Mr. Krabs with the money], Gettin' Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to shoot for me restaurant was a stroke of genius.
,SpongeBob:, ,[The images changes back to show both of them. Mr. Krabs walks away.], All in the line of duty, Mr. Krabs. ,[Squidward crawls over to the register with a torn uniform. He is groaning], Isn't it great, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Great? ,[He looks and points in the opposite direction of SpongeBob], Those little savages tried to kill me.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but it's ,so, worth it when you get to work in these. ,[shows his uniform which consists of red underwear and a disguise mask around his eyes, and you hear a five-note poorly played trumpet fanfare],
,Plankton:, ,[The scene returns to the Chum Bucket and Plankton still looking through his periscope], Stupid kid. Wait a minute, what's this? ,[The scene returns to the Krusty Krab where it shows Karen and Mr. Krabs talking and laughing (Plankton's voice is blocking what they say)], Karen? ,[The image changes to show (through the Krusty Krab window) the exterior of the Chum Bucket with Plankton's Periscope, which shows his eye], My own wife?! ,[The scene changes to show Plankton inside the chum bucket; the door is also shown], Oh, how Krabs mocks me. ,[He pushes his periscope back up],
,Karen:, ,[opens doors to Chum Bucket], Hi, honey.
,Plankton:, ,[He turns around], What's that? A souvenir from your boyfriend Krabs?
,Karen:, ,[The image changes to show Karen's face], Oh, pipe down. I just went to get you this ,[The image changes to show [Plankton looking mad and Karen's hand putting down the Kids Meal box], happy hero box.
,Plankton:, Wha...?! ,[jumps on top of the box], Thanks, babe. You're too good to me. ,[opens the box and gasps], A Mermaid Man action figure...And a Barnacle Boy eraser?! ,[Jumps down and plays with the toys], Look at me. I'm Barnacle Boy. Look at me. I'm Mermaid Man. ,[The scene pans out to show Mr. Krabs on the box], Krabs! ,[hits the side of the box with Krabs' picture on it with his new toys while laughing. He jumps on top of the box and continues to laugh. He jumps off of it. The crushed box is shown.], Sure! Why didn't I think of this before? If Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy can build Krabs up, they can tear him down, too. ,[maniacal laughter. The scene changes to show the exterior of Shady Shoals Rest Home. Snoring can be heard. The scene changes to show the bottom of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's room door. The snoring continues], Ding dong. ,[door opens. Plankton is wearing a plaid, yellow shirt, a red bow tie, and a boater hat with a yellow stripe], Hello, boys. ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are the ones snoring, they wake up],
,Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy:, What? What? What?
,Plankton:, I'm Down Here, Fellas!
,Mermaid Man:, Who are you?
,Plankton:, ,[Hops onto Mermaid Man's foot], Oh, Professor Plankton, Door-to-door salesman. ,[gets out a card], My card.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[takes card and reads it], ""Professor Plankton's Personal Products?""
,Plankton:, ,Say,, you two look like a couple of ladies' men, am I right? ,[An ugly image of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy is seen. A scream and glass breaking can be heard.], I knew it! Just look at that heroic chin. ,[Barnacle Boy's chin has zits and bumps in it and you hear a horse neigh], Those chiseled features. ,[Mermaid Man's ears has hair growing out of it and zits all over and you hear a monkey scream], That bra. ,[An elephant is heard. He then jumps to his neck.], But what's this? Dandruff?
,Mermaid Man:, I've got dandruff?
,Plankton:, You sure do. ,[pours laundry soap around his neck], See?
,Mermaid Man:, Oh, my! ,[looks at soap],
,Plankton:, ,[He goes over to Barnacle Boy's head and lifts up Barnacle Boy's hat but sees there is real dandruff under there. The scene zooms in and shows the dandruff in more detail and snow bells jingling is heard], Ew! ,[He then moves back to Mermaid Man's foot], Couple of studs like you can't go around like this. Lucky for you, Dr. Plankton's come prepared with ""Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo"". A little of this stuff and the ladies will be breakin' down your door.
,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:, ,[Barnacle Boy pulls a lever which moves their couch back until it is flat], Sign us up, Professor.
,Plankton:, ,[He moves to the now-flat back of the couch between both Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy], Wise decision, gentlemen. ,[rubs the shampoo into both of their scalps while humming happily], Hey, what do we have here? You fellas look a little peaked. ,[both are now under Plankton's control], Hmm, this shouldn't be. I wonder. ,[tears off the dandruff tag a little on the shampoo bottle], Say, this isn't Professor Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo! It's Professor Plankton's ,[Pulls of the rest of the tag], Mind Control Shampoo! ,[laughs], With conditioner. Time to prepare for your next role, fellas, as my zombies! ,[laughs. The scene changes, through a card that says ""Wipe!"", to the Krusty Krab where there is a gigantic line outside and giant Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy balloons above the building],
,Kids:, ,[chanting], We want Mermaid Man! We want Barnacle Boy! ,[kids throw Squidward into the window, which solidly flattens and Squidward slides away. The kids chant some more while throwing stuff around], We want Mermaid Man! We want Barnacle Boy! We want Mermaid Man!...
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, hey, kids? ,[The kids stop chanting], Uh, well, there's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the ballroom. ,[all the kids run inside the ballroom and Mr. Krabs closes the door behind them to keep them inside], SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[He jogs over], Yes, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Go get those AWOL do-gooders you talked me into hirin', and bring their patoots back here on the double!
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. ,[He runs off-screen],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Grabs a broom], Back, you! Back! 
,[the broom he was using to keep the kids back is eaten. The scene changes to Shady Shoals Rest Home where all of the fish are either running away or hiding in fear of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's destruction of the place. SpongeBob enters the building],
,SpongeBob:, ,[He goes over to the receptionist], Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, please. And I'm kind of in a hurry. ,[The receptionist shrieks and ducks as a chair is thrown and breaks above him. While waiting, SpongeBob whistle-sings a song], Doot, do, doot-do, doot... ,[Mermaid Man taps him on the shoulder. SpongeBob gasps then shrieks. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy growl at him while under Plankton's control], Oh, my gosh. You guys live in a dump! But we don't have time for that right now. We gotta get you back to the Krusty Krab for your special appearance. I'll take ya. ,[Mermaid Man takes SpongeBob's hand and does the Spine Blaster on him while he grunts.], Wow! I haven't seen you do the Spine Blaster since... ,[Mermaid Man does Spine Blaster on SpongeBob again and he again grunts.], ...since episode 647. ,[Mermaid Man does the Spine Blaster on SpongeBob once again and he still grunts], When you blasted that guy's spine. ,[He whimpers while getting up], You still got it. ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drag SpongeBob off. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab],
,Perch Perkins:, Perch Perkins here, live at the Krusty Krab. We're just moments away from an important press conference with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have with me here Eugene Krabs, owner of the restaurant. Any thoughts, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[muttering gibberish because of all the money in his pocket],
,Perch:, ,[chuckles], Oh, okay. We'll come back to you later. ,[SpongeBob comes crashing down through the ceiling],
,SpongeBob:, Ladies and gentlemen, I present Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy crash through the side of the Krusty Krab. All the kids break through the ballroom cage and run up to their heroes cheering. But Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy throw them aside and go up to the press conference booths while the cameras flash. They growl.],
,Plankton:, ,[hiding in Mermaid Man's right ear], Oh, boy! Everyone in Bikini Bottom showed up! This is gonna be so sweet. ,[maniacal laughter],
,Perch:, Mermaid Man, ,[Clearly and slower than normal.], what is your opinion of the Krabby Patty?
,Plankton:, Ooh! This is too easy. Now just tell everyone that... ,[whispers into his ear],
,Mermaid Man:, I, Mermaid Man, think that Krabby Patties are, uh... uh, what?
,Plankton:, They're terrible! You hate Krabby Patties.
,Mermaid Man:, I'm late for ""Snappy Pabbies?"" Barnacle Boy, ,[He Slaps him which makes him come out of the trance],  we're late for... ,[snores],
,Plankton:, Oh, for crying out loud! ,[walks up to his ear drum], Tell them you hate Krabby Patties! ,[Mermaid Man snores then exhales. Plankton gets frustrated and goes through the ear canal],
,Mermaid Man:, Wha?...
,SpongeBob:, ,[Off-Screen], Mermaid Man. ,[now on-screen, whispering], I brought you something to refresh your memory. ,[He pulls out a Krabby Patty],
,Mermaid Man:, ,[Off-Screen], Ooh, a Krabby Patty! ,[now on-screen, he takes the Krabby Patty from SpongeBob.], Would you look at that? ,[He moves back to Barnacle Boy], Barnacle Boy, it's a Krabby Patty. Why, these things are... ,[becomes under the mind control again], ...evil! 
,[everyone gasps. SpongeBob Screams],
,Frank:, Susie, no! ,[slaps her patty away],
,[Barnacle Boy is also somehow now under the mind control],
,Mermaid Man:, I hate these nasty things, ,[spits on it, SpongeBob becomes broken and cracks into pieces],. And furthermore...
,Plankton:, ,[talks through a microphone inside Mermaid Man], ...let it be known that I, Mermaid Man prefer the delicious food available at the Chum Bucket.
,Mermaid Man:, Your new favorite restaurant!
,[The Crowd gasps],
,SpongeBob:, The Chum Bucket?!! Plankton must be behind this.
,Plankton:, Yes. Yes! ,[He is shown in the pupil of Mermaid Man],  It's working. ,[Laughs. The crowd is mumbling disgustedly and exit the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Hold it right there! You forgot your...Krabby Patties!
,Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy:, ,[They get out of the mind control and drool], Krabby Patties. Krabby Patties!
,Plankton:, Oh, no. Those infernal Krabby Patties. Their grease-fried deliciousness could be enough to free Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ,[Plankton turns a switch to slap Mermaid Man from eating a Krabby Patty. They return back to being under the mind control. Plankton makes Mermaid Man throw one away and then stomp on the one that Barnacle Boy had. Then they walk out and walk past SpongeBob, knocking him over. They are stopped by SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Not so fast! You're not dealing with an ordinary fry cook! It's time for you to meet... ,[throws an exploding capsule on the ground], Fry Boy, Defender of... Ow! ,[notices his that his outfit hasn't changed, so, he uses another exploding capsule to put on another outfit], Fry Boy... ,[ He is now wearing a superhero costume that  features two Krabby Patties, two Spatulas, and a cape. His voice becomes deep and he has a large chin.], ...Defender of the Krabby Patty! ,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy growl and run after SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws the patties up into the air and hits them with his spatulas sending them to Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy but the heroes duck. SpongeBob jumps. The heroes continue to  run. SpongeBob stretches his arms around some coral and sends the heroes back towards him. He trips them into the ground and eating a Krabby Patty], Yes! You lose, Plankton! Now watch as the Krabby Patties' wholesome flavors work their magic! ,[nothing happens so Plankton sends the heroes over to the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, I did it! I did it! Look at all these customers. ,[evil laugh], In your face, Krabs. Yes!
,Harold:, So, uh, where's the food?
,Plankton:, ,[laughs evil. Gasps], Food? Oh, yeah. Never thought I'd get this far. ,[goes into the kitchen],
,[The Scene changes to show SpongeBob still stomped in the ground],
,SpongeBob:, It doesn't make sense. ,[He pops his head out], They should have been cured once the pureness of the Krabby Patties entered their... That's it! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are elderly. ,[Scene changes to inside Mermaid Man's stomach], Their poor aging tummies must be having a hard time digesting the food. ,[Scene changes back to SpongeBob], I know just what to do! ,[He exits the hole and runs to the Away. He crashes through the Chum Bucket's wall with a ""fiber"" truck and pours fiber into the heroes mouths. Their stomachs digest the food and they go return to their normal selves.],
,Mermaid Man:, I'm back to my old self again! Thanks to you, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, And the delicious power of Krabby Patties. ,[He looks at the ""camera"" almost like it is a commercial.],
,Mermaid Man:, Say, I could use a couple more of those, and an order of Krabby Fries.
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[walks out of the bathroom], And a decent latrine.
,SpongeBob:, Well, then, you guys know where to go!
,SpongeBob, Mermaid Man, & Barnacle Boy:, To the Krusty Krab! Away! ,[everyone goes over to the Krusty Krab],
,Plankton:, Hey, everyone, I made Chummy Joes!, [Plankton screams as he sees everyone at the Krusty Krab],

"[SpongeBob is grilling Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab kitchen until one of them suddenly levitates up from the grill and turns into a jellyfish. It floats out the window as the rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and do the same. SpongeBob follows them and flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. He buzzes around Jellyfish Fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob? SpongeBob! ,[the grill is on fire], Wake up, boy! You're burning me money! ,[SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and screams. Then runs behind Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
,Mr. Krabs:, Here, use this! ,[Hands SpongeBob a fire extinguisher. SpongeBob throws it at the grill and sets the fire larger than before. Mr. Krab looks at SpongeBob for his stupidity, as he realizes his error. SpongeBob then tries to blow on the fire to put it out until a fireman comes into the kitchen with a hose and sprays SpongeBob with the water. SpongeBob enlarges and falls backwards, which puts out the fire],
,Mr. Krabs and Fireman:, Hooray! ,[SpongeBob shrinks and burns into a black sponge while Mr. Krabs scrapes him off the grill and on to a spatula],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, come into me office. ,[in Mr. Krabs office], What's wrong, boy?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I.
,Mr. Krabs:, This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I've been thinking.
,Mr. Krabs:, We need to get you thinking about work. ,[stretches his eyes out],
,SpongeBob:, No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. ,[Mr. Krabs laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. ,[shows kitchen], This is your wide open range. ,[shows grill], These are your amber waves. ,[shows greasy fryers], And this,[picks up a spatula from the sink],oh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob's gone], SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks out the Krusty Krab], I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! ,[throws his hat on the ground],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[opens doors], SpongeBob, wait! ,[sees SpongeBob's hat on the ground and screams], Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. ,[SpongeBob is now giving his stuff away to his friends],
,SpongeBob:, And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. ,[gives it to him],
,Squidward:, And I thought this friendship would never pay off. ,[walks away],
,Patrick:, ,[teary-eyed], Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
,SpongeBob:, It's all yours. ,[Patrick holds up a bunch of phone books],
,Patrick:, A-a-and these old phone books?
,SpongeBob:, All yours, old friend. ,[walks off and comes back with a case], Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. ,[opens up a rectangular box that has the words ""Ol' Reliable"" on the front. A glowing jellyfish net is inside. Patrick throws the phone books away and picks up Ol' Reliable],
,Patrick:, Ol' Reliable? ,[cries as Sandy walks up],
,Sandy:, Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?
,SpongeBob:, No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. ,[SpongeBob pats Sandy's helmet],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy. ,[walks away], Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye. ,[walks behind a bush and takes his pants off], I won't be needing these. ,[drops pants and runs away], Buzz, buzz, buzz.
,Squidward:, He took off his pants.
,Sandy:, I'll give him a week. ,[walks away],
,Squidward:, I'll give him eleven minutes. ,[walks away, throwing off the can opener at Patrick],
,Patrick:, Patrick sad! ,[at Jellyfish Fields],
,SpongeBob:, ,[touches Jellyfish Fields sign], I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home! ,[jellyfish knock SpongeBob down as they fly by], Brothers and sisters, wait for me! ,[jellyfish fly into a hive], Buzz buzz.

My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... ,[sticks his finger in his mouth and then in his head], ...that way. ,[points to where the jellyfish went], Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. ,[running after jellyfish all over the fields. Jellyfish devour a bunch of kelp. SpongeBob decides to try it but is disgusted and spits it out from his tongue], This is the life. ,[jellyfish are floating in the middle of the fields as SpongeBob walks into the middle of the group], Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz? ,[wants to shake a jellyfish's hand], Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are? ,[jellyfish stings him and his hand, causing it to start swelling], Uhh... nice to meet you. ,[hand gets huge and swollen. SpongeBob smells some aroma and goes to check and see that Patrick and Sandy are having a picnic with Krabby Patties],
,Sandy:, ""Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!"" ,[whispers into Patrick's ear], There he is, Patrick. Say your line!
,Patrick:, ,[reading off script], ""Why, thank you, Sandy, I would love one. [take patty.]"" ,[takes patty], ""Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. [take bite.]"" ,[sniffles. tries to take a bite, but throws the patty and the script away and turns to SpongeBob], I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm not coming home.
,Patrick:, I miss you! ,[cuts to Sandy waving hello, but in guilt  manner because of set-up], Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! ,[Squidward is throwing himself a party at home],
,SpongeBob:, I'm happy here. This is my home now. ,[Sandy drags Patrick away],
,Patrick:, No! ,SpongeBob!, ,[later, SpongeBob comes in wiggling his arms and legs like the jellyfish],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this. ,[jellyfish float away as the net is swung at SpongeBob, which knocks him down. Patrick, breathing heavily,  is ready to capture SpongeBob with Ol' Reliable], Patrick! What are you doing?
,Patrick:, If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! ,[shows a jar with a label on the front that says SpongeBob - Friend], I even picked out this nice jar for you!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! ,[Patrick swings the net at SpongeBob but SpongeBob runs away. Patrick goes after him. SpongeBob hides behind a snail's shell, but the snail slithers off. SpongeBob goes to hide behind a rock],
,Patrick:, I can see you there! ,[SpongeBob hides behind a bush], I still see you! ,[SpongeBob hides behind another rock], You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob runs under neath an “N” shaped rock and peeks around. Patrick is underneath the rock on the top], I got you now, SpongeBob! ,[falls on the ground and misses SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! No! ,[Patrick runs after SpongeBob again as SpongeBob jumps into the jellyfish hive. Patrick tries to get the hive down with the net but fails multiple times],
,Patrick:, Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy. ,[breaks the net in half and walks away, sobbing],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. ,[a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it], Mmm, jelly. ,[eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive], Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. ,[jellyfish buzz into the hive], Greetings, comrades! ,[the jellyfish repeatedly shock SpongeBob and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive and runs as the jellyfish keep shocking him. Later, SpongeBob is in a cave], Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. ,[rips off a bushel of grass], Buzz. ,[pushes rock over as he uses it for his pillow], Buzz. ,[pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The blanket scrunches up, but SpongeBob pushes it back down.

Poison sea urchins! ,[screams and scratches the urchins off of him and runs out of the cave], Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. ,[crawls on the ground to stop the itching. Later, SpongeBob is walking home], Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. ,[buzzes fourteen more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door and sees a plate full of Krabby Patties on a table], Krabby Patties. ,[walks past Sandy's treedome, then he sniffles], Sandy. ,[still buzzing, walks up to his pineapple], What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. ,[opens the door and turns the light on. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are there to welcome him home],
,All:, Welcome home, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. ,[hands him a Krabby Patty],

,[Squidward goes to refill his watering can. SpongeBob and Patrick jump into Squidward's garden. SpongeBob kick one of the carrots out of the ground and beats it up. He then karate chops the carrot into pieces.],
,TV Announcer:, Carrot chop!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick punch a potato into fries.],
,TV Announcer:, Potato pow!
,[Patrick pulls out one of the lettuces and smashes it with his face.],
,TV Announcer:, Lettuce laceration!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick make the vegetables into a salad and start eating it. Squidward returns with the filled up watering can and sees his garden destroyed. Patrick eats the rest of the salad.],
,SpongeBob:, Although our foes were evil, their nutrition did not go to waste, Doctor Negative.
,[SpongeBob gives Squidward the empty salad bowl and walks away.],
,Patrick:, We're watching you!
,[Patrick follows SpongeBob.],
,Squidward:, That's it! I'm gonna clobber you two!
,[Squidward grabs his rake and runs over to SpongeBob and Patrick, who appears to have stripped off their costumes, in an attempt to attack them. However, before he could do that, the Krusty Krab horn goes off.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, do you hear that? You'd better hurry up or you'll be late for work.
,Patrick:, ,[eating a carrot], Yeah. You'd better do something or whatever.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk off. Squidward starts to freak out and breaks his rake in half. However, in doing so, he also breaks his three legs in half as well. He looks down and realizes what he had just done. Squidward loses his balance and falls over. The scene changes to Squidward arriving at the Krusty Krab and Patrick is sitting at a table.],
,Patrick:, ♪Mermaid Man, our hero! Barnacle Boy, you too!♪
,SpongeBob:, ,[flipping patties], ♪Mermaid Man, crime-fighter! Barnacle Boy, makes do!♪
,Patrick:, ♪Evil found its match today! Underwater justice and fair play!♪

,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ♪Super plan! Garbage can! Mini van! Mermaid Man!♪
,[Squidward screams in agony as SpongeBob and Patrick sing loudly in his ears.],
,Squidward:, Will you two shut up about that stupid show?!
,[SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with his Mermaid Man costume on.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, did you say something negative, Doctor Negative?
,Squidward:, What the? How did...
,[SpongeBob leaps over to Patrick, who is now in his Barnacle Boy costume.],
,Patrick:, I heard him say something negative!
,[A customer comes out of the bathroom with toilet paper stuck to his foot.],
,Patrick:, Mermaid Man, that injured victim's bandages have come undone!
,SpongeBob:, That poor man needs aid!
,[SpongeBob pulls out a first aid kit from Patrick's butt.],
,SpongeBob:, Of the first variety.
,[Patrick opens the first aid kit and SpongeBob takes out the roll of bandages. SpongeBob and Patrick wrap the customer (while SpongeBob is singing quietly) with the bandages and put him in a wheelchair. SpongeBob gives him a blood transfusion bag for the customer.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! We've forgot the peroxide.
,[Patrick pours the bottle of peroxide on the customer's head, making his eyes burn.],
,SpongeBob:, That should hold you until your surgeons can amputate our torso.
,[The customer rolls away in disgust. SpongeBob and Patrick unite their rings.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Justice restored!
,Squidward:, Hey, Superdorks! Your turn to take out the garbage.
,[Squidward holds out a bag of trash and drops it on the floor. Patrick picks it up.],
,SpongeBob:, Alright, Doctor Negative. We'll play along and take it out. Hiya!
,[SpongeBob punches a hole on the trash bag and sludge flies out.],
,TV Announcer:, Junk jab!
,[Gus gets covered in the sludge. Patrick punches the trash bag as well and sludge flies out.],
,TV Announcer:, Trash thwap!
,[The sludge flies into Harold's mouth. SpongeBob and Patrick pull on the trash bag and rips it open, which sends sludge flying all over the restaurant.],
,TV Announcer:, Putrid pop!
,[The customers gets splattered by the sludge and they leave the restaurant in anger and disgust. Mr. Krabs comes out of the office and sees the place completely trashed.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Why are all my tables empty? Why am I not makin' money?
,Squidward:, Because these two costume creeps chased them out.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick do their action poses.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hello? ,[rubs his eyes], Mr. Squidward, step into me office.
,[Mr. Krabs goes back into his office.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh-oh, Patrick. I think we got Squidward in trouble.
,[Squidward enters Mr. Krabs' office.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm gonna share a secret with you that I never told anyone.
,Squidward:, Uh, that's okay. I don't need to hear. Uh...
,[Mr. Krabs takes out a remote and pushes the button. The remote activates a hidden door on the wall and reveals a room filled with comic books.],
,Squidward:, Hmm?
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs walk into the room and Squidward takes one of the comic books.],
,Squidward:, ,[laughs], You're a comic book geek!
,[Mr. Krabs freaks out and takes the comic book away from Squidward. He puts the comic book in a plastic bag.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't touch those! They're mint condition... worth a fortune!
,Squidward:, So you read comics. Don't worry. Lots of perfectly immature adults read comics.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, it's deeper than that.
,[Mr. Krabs pulls a secret switch a reveals a super villain costume behind another hidden door.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I sold it meself. It's Captain Tightwad from Issue 53! They say he's a bad guy, but, you know, I think he's just misunderstood.
,Squidward:, Oh, look at that. I think I've left my oven on.
,[Squidward attempts to leave, but Mr. Krabs pulls him back.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I have some fabric leftover. So, I made this.
,[Mr. Krabs pulls out a shirt with a ""no"" sign on it.],
,Squidward:, Oh, don't tell me. Doctor Negative?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are outside the office door, trying to hear what's going on.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy, you high-sea halfwits!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp and run away from the door. Mr. Krabs pops out in his Captain Tightwad costume.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Tremble before Captain Tightwad!
,[Mr. Krabs doesn't see Squidward.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward!
,[Squidward comes out in his Doctor Negative costume.],
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], And cower in fear of Doctor Negative.
,SpongeBob:, Holy Shrimp! This is the best day of my life!
,[Patrick giggles. Mr. Krabs pulls out three coins attached by strings as though if they are villain weapons. He throws his weapons to SpongeBob and Patrick and they were able to dodge them. He looks at Squidward.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you waiting for?
,[Mr. Krabs grabs Squidward and throws him to SpongeBob. Squidward gets his arms tangled in SpongeBob's body. Squidward pulls his arms out and sends him spinning around like a top. He hits the register boat, some tables and a pole like a pinball in a pinball machine.],
,TV Announcer:, Sad!
,[Mr. Krabs and Patrick fight each other by flapping their hands in their faces.],
,TV Announcer:, Pathetic!
,[Squidward bashes into Mr. Krabs and Patrick.],
,TV Announcer:, Mediocre!
,[SpongeBob jumps down from the rail and splats himself on the floor.],
,TV Announcer:, Sub-par!
,[SpongeBob pulls himself out of the floor.],
,SpongeBob:, Why are we fighting Captain Tightwad? He didn't even commit a crime.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wha... What do ya mean?
,[SpongeBob takes out glasses and an old comic book.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs. It's right here in Mermaid Man Number 98. ""No superhero shall fight a super villain until that super villain has committed a crime.""
,Mr. Krabs:, Arr... Uh... Hey!
,[Mr. Krabs runs to the register and puts money in his pants.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha! See? I just stole some money!
,SpongeBob:, Well, it's not really stealing if it's your own money.
,[Mr. Krabs sulks and money falls out of his pants.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, come on! What do... What do I have to do here?
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs at the First Nautical Bank.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Are you sure about this? Isn't robbing a bank against the law?
,SpongeBob:, Well, yes Mr. Krabs. But you're not really robbing a bank, you're just pretending to.
,Mr. Krabs:, And then we can play?
,SpongeBob:, Yep!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, okay.
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs enter the bank.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy! Anyone home? It's Captain Tightwad and Doctor Negative! We're here to rob ya! Anyone here? No.
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs see the security guard sleeping on a chair.],
,Security Guard:, Eh, barnacle nickels! Uh, can I help you ladies?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yeah! Thanks old timer! Um, we're pretending to rob this bank. Where's the tellers? Where's the money?
,Security Guard:, There ain't no tellers. ATM's outside.
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs see a long line of customers at the ATM machine. SpongeBob and Patrick are seen in the line.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, barnacles! I've forgot me debit card.
,Security Guard:, Wait a minute! I don't care if you are ladies! Nobody pretends to rob my bank!
,[The security guard rips his shirt and bulks up. He beats up both Mr. Krabs and Squidward, leaving them injured. SpongeBob gives them a thumbs up. The scene changes to the gang walking to the evil store while Squidward and Mr. Krabs are in casts and crutches.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! You were so convincing! You had that guard totally fooled! I think we should skip to the end of the story. Let's just stop here and pick up some props for your evil lair. We'll just need a few dollars.
,[Mr. Krabs takes out his wallet and SpongeBob grabs it.],
,SpongeBob:, Boink!
,[SpongeBob goes into the store with Mr. Krabs' wallet.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm supposed to be the villain, but why do I feel like I'm being robbed?
,TV Announcer:, One hour later...
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab now changed into the Krusty Lair. Everything inside the restaurant is filled with props that SpongeBob bought at the store. SpongeBob and Patrick are in a cage and they're both tied up.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Captain Tightwad! Doctor Negative, you can come out now!
,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward pops out of the giant cash register. Mr. Krabs lands perfectly while Squidward falls flat on his face.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, so here's the scene. You two have us here in this cage over a pool of boiling oil. Now that is a crime. Now, you can let us out so we can fight.
,Squidward:, Oh, I don't think we're going to do that.
,[Squidward pulls the lever and activates the machine. The machine begins to lower the cage.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, wha... what are you doing?
,Squidward:, Being evil. Isn't that what you wanted? Aren't you scared? Boo-hoo?
,SpongeBob:, Boo-hoo? Do you expect us to cry?
,Squidward:, No, Mr. Bob. I expect you to fry!
,[Squidward laughs evilly and Mr. Krabs laughs as well. But as Mr. Krabs calms down, Squidward gives a malicious grin on his face.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, okay, Squidward. Playtime's over. This is getting a little intense here.
,Squidward:, Too long have I suffered living between you two ninnies! But now, now as Doctor Negative, I shall finally exact my exquisite revenge! ,[laugh maniacally],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle.],
,SpongeBob:, See? I just knew we'd make a terrific bad guy. He is really committing.
,Patrick:, You did a great job with casting.
,TV Announcer:, Could this be the end of our doofus duo? Deep fried like two tenacious tater tots on tenterhooks?
,SpongeBob:, Swing, Boy Yonder! Swing the basket!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick swing the basket back and forth until they knock the machine over, creating a crack on the floor. The sudden force makes Squidward and Mr. Krabs fall into the boiling oil and both of them are fried. The restaurant begins to crack all over and crumble down into pieces. SpongeBob pulls a frybasket out from Patrick's butt and takes Squidward and Mr. Krabs out of the oil. Patrick eats Squidward's hand. Mr. Krabs and Squidward shake the crusts off them and are now in their underwear.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh boy, Mr. Krabs! That was the best Mermaid Man playdate ever!
,Patrick:, Yeah. Not bad. But next time, we won't go so easy on ya!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[groans as he takes out his comics], Maybe I'll just stick to reading comics from now on.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, To the Mermalair!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick leap into the street and drag themselves as if they are driving the Invisible Boatmobile.],
,TV Announcer:, And so ends another numb-skulled episode of the preposterous pair, Mermaid Pants and Barnacle Star! Tune in next time for more mind-running adventures! I've really gotta find another job! I wonder if it's too late to go back to college radio!

,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill. ,[Pearl shoves the giant pill in his mouth and he swallows it], Pearl, do you think I'm... old?
,Pearl:, Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.
,Mr. Krabs:, But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?
,Pearl:, See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say ""coral,"" as in, ""That nose job is so coral.""
,Mr. Krabs:, Coral, eh?
,Pearl:, Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-,ral,.

,Harold:, Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks. ,[Mr. Krabs turns around and notices he has two signals on his behind, the right arrow is blinking, so he covers his behind. He continues to walk until a ball rolls next to him],
,Tyler:, Hey, mister, could you throw the ball back over here?

,SpongeBob:, Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers. ,[SpongeBob digs a hole and puts the flower in it], You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty. ,[turns around and grabs his container. When he turns back around, the flower is half eaten. He plants a new flower. When he turns around and grabs the container of water, he sees the flower is eaten again], Huh? ,[plants a new one], I'm not taking my eyes off you. ,[eyes stretch out staring at the flower],
,Narrator:, Three days later...
,[SpongeBob is still staring, but his eyes have shriveled up. He uses the water to make his eyes normal],
,Patrick:, ,[running by], Hey, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around], Hi, Patrick! ,[when SpongeBob turns back around, the flower is eaten again], How does this keep happening? ,[notices a seahorse eating the flower next to him], Hi. ,[horse neighs then gallops onto a rock], She's beautiful! ,[SpongeBob imagines riding the seahorse with a head full of wavy hair], What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish? ,[scene cuts to seahorse eating some flowers and SpongeBob looking at her from a distance writing in a book], Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic. Perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty, or Debbie. ,[seahorse neighs], She must have spotted my floral bookmark! ,[using a flower bookmark in his book. Mystery gallops over slowly], She's coming this way. That's it, girl. Don't be afraid. I'm just a talking sponge, is all. ,[Mystery sniffs the bookmark and then eats it. Scene cuts to SpongeBob riding with Mystery, blowing a bubble heart, posting for Mystery, making stamp books, and walking out of a store laughing with hats. Scene cuts to nighttime in SpongeBob's bed where SpongeBob is sleeping on the floor and Mystery is in SpongeBob's bed], Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever? ,[Mystery is asleep], I'll take that as a yes!
,Squidward:, ,[it's now morning as Squidward rides his bike. SpongeBob and Mystery gallop by him], What the...?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine to work, I see!
,Squidward:, Don't say anything, Squidward, remember your karma. ,[Squidward's bike trips on something and he falls off a cliff, then explodes. He groans. SpongeBob arrives at the Krusty Krab and ties Mystery to a bike rack],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift. ,[walks in as Scooter and Martin walk by],
,Scooter:, Hey, look, Mr. Krabs put in a kiddy ride!
,Martin:, Why doncha try it out? ,[Scooter gets out a quarter],
,Scooter:, I can't find the coin slot. Here it is! ,[Scooter finds the coin slot but Mystery kicks Scooter into the background and he explodes],
,Martin:, ,[runs off; screams; still in Southern drawl], Help! Kiddy ride on the loose!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks out], What's with all the ruckus? ,[gasps], A monster scaring away me customers!
,SpongeBob:, That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery.
,Mr. Krabs:, You're a mystery, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob laughs], Get rid of it.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!
,Mr. Krabs:, It's either you or Mystery.
,SpongeBob:, I knew I should've named her Debbie. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob, sad, grilling up some patties],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!
,SpongeBob:, ,[in a sad voice], You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward. ,[laughs then walks out],
,SpongeBob:, Good one, sir. ,[takes his pair of sad eye contacts off], Ha! It worked, girl! ,[opens the cabinet with Mystery inside it], We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build. ,[scene cuts to Patrick sitting down with a board on his forehead, doing absolutely nothing], Only eight more hours. ,[closes cupboards],
,Narrator:, Twelve seconds later... ,[Mystery peeks out of the cupboard],
,SpongeBob:, No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job. ,[SpongeBob gives her a tray with a patty on it], Wait a second. I bet you're hungry. How ‘bout some lunch? ,[Mystery eats the patty and neighs], Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or...
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob closes the cabinet quickly as Mr. Krabs comes bursting in], What was that? Is that horse in here?
,SpongeBob:, No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery. Weesnaw.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, keep working on it! That was terrible! ,[walks out],
,SpongeBob:, That was close. ,[gets a tray with three patties], From now on, no more hijinks. Order up! ,[puts the tray on the window. Mystery eats it. Squidward walks up to the window],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, where's my order?
,SpongeBob:, Did you look under the tray?
,Squidward:, No I didn't, sorry. ,[looks under the tray then sighs], SpongeBob, could you just get my order?
,SpongeBob:, They vanished. Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next? I gotta get out of here! ,[runs to the door],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!
,SpongeBob:, Oh.
,Squidward:, ,[Mystery approaches a customer's Krabby Patty], In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, ,[SpongeBob notices Mystery], you cook the food, then the customer gets the food. ,[SpongeBob's eyes move to the side of his face. Squidward is still talking], We do that for forty years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say? ,[Mystery eats a Krabby Patty and she burps], 
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back. ,[grabs Mystery and shoves her under a cupboard],
,Squidward:, What's that?
,SpongeBob:, Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control! ,[closes the cupboard], Now then, you were saying?
,Squidward:, Just get my order. ,[walks out],
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Squidward? ,[chuckles], Ghosts. ,[Mystery eats SpongeBob's Krusty Krab work hat], Mystery, you ate my hat! ,[Mystery burps out a spatula], Mystery, you ate my spatula! You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[from inside Mystery's belly], I don't want to be a burden.
,Squidward:, ,[customers yelling...], Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.
,Thaddeus:, Where's our food?
,Fred:, I'm so hungry!
,Tina:, This is my only lunch hour!
,Tom:, Where's Old Man Jenkins?
,Squidward:, Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, what's going on in here?
,Squidward:, Why don't you ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs into the kitchen], SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? Davey H. Jones! ,[SpongeBob is by Mystery's side, who has eaten too much],
,SpongeBob:, Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda. ,[Mystery spits out Old Man Jenkins],
,Old Man Jenkins:, What did I miss? ,[Mr. Krabs takes out his eyes, blows on them, rubs them, and puts them back on],
,Mr. Krabs:, So, my eyes ,are, correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!
,SpongeBob:, No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend! ,[Mystery licks SpongeBob's cheek. Squidward cries because of a bowl of onions near him],
,Squidward:, Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles], You do?
,Mr. Krabs:, I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.
,SpongeBob:, What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffles], And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda! ,[sobbing], My best friend! ,[crying], ,[Squidward cries because of the onions again],
,Squidward:, What? Would you get out of here?
,Mr. Krabs:, The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard. ,[points to Mystery], Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse. ,[two customers spit out their patties],
,SpongeBob:, Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.
,Nat Peterson:, ,[crying because of the bowl of onions Squidward is holding under his nose], Hey!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, girl, you're free to go. ,[takes Mystery outside and takes Mystery's leash off], I can't keep you anymore. ,[cries], I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild. ,[Mystery gallops away], Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore? ,[Patrick walks up with the board on his head, as SpongeBob bawls extremely harder], Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal! ,[resumes wailing intensely, Patrick walks away as Mr. Krabs walks up to SpongeBob], Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.
,Squidward:, Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad! ,[vault of money opens to show dollar bills that have been eaten and a bunch of money is missing],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,Get that horse!, ,[He and SpongeBob run after Mystery.], 
,SpongeBob:, Mystery!
,Mr. Krabs:, Come back!
,SpongeBob:, Mystery! Weesnaw!
,Both:, Mystery, come back here!

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[angrily], I heard that, Mr. Squidward!
,[SpongeBob hides in his hat.],
,Squidward:, ,[nervously], It wasn't an insult, Mr. Krabs. It was a—a—a—a tribute. Haven't you ever heard of ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery""?
,[SpongeBob's eyes peek out under his hat.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You trying to tell me that was a ""complement""?
,Squidward:, Exactly. It's my homage to you and your love for money.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grumbles], Well, you got me there. I do love money. ,[giggles], Excellent observation, Mr. Squidward.
,[Mr. Krabs dives into the cash register. SpongeBob comes out from hiding in his hat.],

,Plankton:, Check-mate...
,[Sandy yanks and unsticks the piece off of him],
,Sandy:, Plankton, maybe we should play a game that's a little less dangerous. You're flatter than hammered horse hockey.

,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.
,SpongeBob:, But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it? ,[SpongeBob imagines a quiet bank and a bank robber bursting in wearing a mask over his head and SpongeBob's name tag],
,Bank Robber:, Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica! ,[cuts back to SpongeBob who hyperventilates in fear],
,SpongeBob:, I'm innocent, I tell ya! ,[faints then awakens and walks over to Squidward], Squidward, what happened?
,Squidward:, Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[hyperventilates again],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? ,[Mr. Krabs comes out of his office],
,Mr. Krabs:, Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot! ,[SpongeBob and Squidward stare nervously at Mr. Krabs, who pulls out a big, black boot emitting toxic green fumes], This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour. ,[Mr. Krabs zips back into his office. SpongeBob starts gasping again],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.
,SpongeBob:, Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.
,Squidward:, ,[flattered], Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks off], Cover me till I get back, okay?
,Squidward:, Oh, sure, sure. ,[chuckles], A genius? Well, how about... Hey! ,[cuts to SpongeBob walking down the road],
,SpongeBob:, Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning. ,[walks by Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi Patrick. ,[runs back to Patrick], You said hi to me this morning, right?
,Patrick:, As I do every morning.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I need you to do it again.
,Patrick:, That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you talking about?
,Patrick:, My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps.
,Patrick:, You lost your name tag? ,[hyperventilates like SpongeBob does. Scene cuts to SpongeBob poking his head out his window and Patrick standing outside his house],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?
,Patrick:, I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say ""hi"", just like this morning.
,SpongeBob:, Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up. ,[climbs in bed], I sure hope this works. ,[pretends to go to sleep then jumps up], Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it! ,[blanket falls on his head which causes him to fall and his alarm clock to fall on him again], So far, so good. ,[falls down the staircase and lands in his living room. The alarm clock shoots him out], I don't see my name tag up here. ,[smacks into his window then slides off of it to Gary], Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast? ,[grabs a can of Snail-Po and sings], The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way. ,[pours the food into Gary's bowl, then tastes it], Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick. ,[walks by Patrick, outside, but he doesn't say anything], Patrick!
,Patrick:, What?
,SpongeBob:, You were supposed to say hi to me!
,Patrick:, Hi.
,SpongeBob:, Oh. All right, let's take it from the top. ,[walks off],
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Don't forget your line this time!
,Patrick:, I won't.
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. ,[falls down the staircase], The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah. ,[walks by Patrick who, again, says nothing, and SpongeBob growls], Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!
,Patrick:, What's my motivation?
,SpongeBob:, ,[angrily], Forget the motivation! Just say hi! ,[walks off. Cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then walks by Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry. ,[laughs], I'm sorry. Let's try it again. ,[cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then walks outside past Patrick], Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai... ,[laughs], Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people. ,[cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then he walks outside by Patrick, who is trying not to laugh], I've got the giggles.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.
,Patrick:, Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?
,SpongeBob:, Hmm, let's see. ,[imagines what he did today in his thought bubble], I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster. ,[cuts to SpongeBob being thrown into a dumpster by the Krusty Krab. He laughs], Good one, guys! ,[tries getting up but slips into the garbage again],
,Patrick:, That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.
,Patrick:, Well, then we'll look in the dumpster! ,[cuts to the dumpster outside the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Eh, what is that stench?
,Patrick:, That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost. ,[gets on all fours], Hop on, pal.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps in the dumpster], Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.
,Patrick:, I wish I had a nose.
,SpongeBob:, Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.
,Patrick:, Cannonball! ,[does a cannonball and jumps to the dumpster. He spits some dirt out and laughs; his teeth are filled with filth],
,SpongeBob:, You look over there and I'll look over here.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[digs through the trash while throwing some on SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I'm looking. I'm looking.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick? Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[digs even faster], I'm looking as fast as I can.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! ,[Patrick stops and turns around to see SpongeBob covered in garbage], Thank you. ,[Patrick pulls trash off of SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?
,SpongeBob:, Have you ,[throws all the garbage away in anger], forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!
,Patrick:, Yes.
,SpongeBob:, I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.
,Patrick:, Could I have another hint?
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at the viewers and blinks twice], Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got ,[looks at his watch], one minute till inspection. ,[screams and jumps], One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time. ,[digs quicker],
,Patrick:, ,[notices a name tag on the back of SpongeBob's shirt], Hey, SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Not now, Patrick.
,Patrick:, I know where your name tag is. ,[SpongeBob turns around],
,SpongeBob:, Where?! Where?!
,Patrick:, Uh... I can't remember.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I don't have time for this! ,[turns back around],
,Patrick:, There it is!
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around again], Where?!
,Patrick:, Uh... ,[SpongeBob becomes angry], I forgot again.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, are you with me or against me?
,Patrick:, Could you give me a hint? ,[SpongeBob simply turns back around], There! I see it!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!
,Patrick:, ,[turns around, angry], Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.
,SpongeBob:, My shirt backward... ,[looks at his clothes], What the...? ,[bends his head back to his back], My shirt's on backwards! ,[Patrick looks at him], I had my identity all along. ,[spins his shirt around and looks at his watch], Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick. ,[shakes hands with Patrick],
,Patrick:, ,[shakes hands with SpongeBob], Don't mention it, buddy. ,[cuts to the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Fall in for inspection! All right, you two... ,[inspects Squidward], Hat and uniform seem to be in order. ,[notices a few hairs in Squidward's nose], Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.
,Squidward:, Hoorah.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[moves to SpongeBob, who is stinky because of the dumpster], Okay, boy, your turn.
,SpongeBob:, ,[salutes], I think you'll find everything shipshape.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffs SpongeBob and he covers his nose because he smells bad], Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?
,SpongeBob:, Uh... discovery? ,[Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and sets him outside. Flashback ends and cuts back to the diner], And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story. ,[Ted yawns while the waitress checks her watch],
,Waitress:, Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Thanks, uh... ,[looks at her name tag], Betty.
,Waitress:, What? ,[looks down at her name tag], Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty. I just borrowed her uniform while mine's at the cleaners. ,[SpongeBob looks at the viewers, confused],

"[At the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in the bathroom, looking at a filthy sink mirror.],
,SpongeBob:, You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place. ,[squirts soap on his head and scrubs the mirror clean, then puts work hat on his head from his nose ], Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words. ,[gets mop and bucket], Now to attack these floors!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in his office, on the phone, chuckling], Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates. ,[turns to reveal an ear on his back],
,Mr. Krabs:, And he's been with me for such a long time now.
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles again], I am.
,Mr. Krabs:, But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.
,SpongeBob:, Yep, he's gonna have to--  ,[notices, shocked], What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or ,[gasps], Squidward! ,[SpongeBob stands behind Squidward, who is sitting down], Phew! I ,am, taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!
,Squidward:, ,[stands up], No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy. ,[walks away],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement. ,[SpongeBob stands right next to Squidward in the workstation],
,Squidward:, What do you think you're doing?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy... ,[makes himself taller, like a skyscraper], ...and it looks like it ,is, you!
,Squidward:, No, I'm not! ,[walks away],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, wait! ,[becomes short again], We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet! ,[extends legs],
,Squidward:, ,[off-screen], I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!
,SpongeBob:, You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. Whoa! ,[walks off balance, then falls and breaks a table], Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts. ,[makes a strange face], Face the facts that ,I'm, the little guy! ,[tears up, making another face], And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today.
,Squidward:, ,[smiles], Krabs is letting you go today? ,[laughs], As in I won't have to work with you ever again. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks through the doors and becomes flattened, sad], Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it. ,[the wind blows SpongeBob away],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[still on the phone], Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go. ,[a little scallop in a cage is shown], Gotten too big for his cage. ,[releases the scallop], Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed.
,[as scallop flies away, SpongeBob floats into his house, landing in a chair],

,SpongeBob:, Oh, what's the use, Gary? ,[body pops up to his normal self], I've lost the will to go on! ,[bursts into tears on the couch, then stops, noticing a rumble from a refrigerator Patrick is pulling with a rope], ,[sniffs sadly], Hi, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob. ,[happily], I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again.
,SpongeBob:, ,[confused], What happened to yours?
,Patrick:, Nothing, it's just empty.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sad], Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator.
,Patrick:, Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you,,[sniffs], or Gary, ,[sniffs again], or for anybody!
,Patrick:, ,[shocked], Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sad], I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.

Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones. ,[bubble transition to SpongeBob reading a clean newspaper], Lawyer, no. Too much arguing.

,SpongeBob:, I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick. ,[walks in front of a billboard showing a live sponge], I need to start fresh. ,[some words on billboard sparkle as SpongeBob talks], With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, ""This is a job for a sponge."" Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?
,Patrick:, No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!
,SpongeBob:, I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?
,Patrick:, Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.
,SpongeBob:, That's just a billboard, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Why don't you get a job as a billboard?
,SpongeBob:, I...don't think that's physically possible, ,[happily], ,but, I could audition to be a sponge model.
,Patrick:, Fine, do it your way.
,[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick walking into the Bikini Bottom Television (BBTV) building],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent.

,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?
,Patrick:, Why don't you find out?
,SpongeBob:, ,[quickly covers the door], Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back. ,[starts walking out, but Patrick stops him],
,Patrick:, No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore. ,This, is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries! ,[pushes SpongeBob through the door to a lady fish, a casting director, looking at a clipboard], ,[to casting director], My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, well, ,want, is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it. ,[to Patrick], I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick.
,Casting Director:, ,[stops SpongeBob and Patrick from walking out], Hold it. You want the audition, kid? You got it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns his whole body around, happily], I did?
,Casting Director:, Show me what you got.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sweats, worried], Okay. Here goes. ,[clears throat], Patrick, please? ,[Patrick hands out a metal tool and hits it on his forehead, playing a note], ♪ ,Laaa!, ♪ ,[clears throat again], Sorry. ,[keeps clearing throat and getting a perfect pitch at the same time, from high to low],
,Casting Director:, Okay, okay, okay! Let's get on with this train wreck.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, getting on it. ,[clears throat yet again, then sings off-key], ♪ ,When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim!, ♪
,Casting Director:, ,[unenthusiastically], All right, all right. Thank you. I've heard enough.
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs closely to the casting director], How'd I do?
,Casting Director:, Horribly. I've seen clams with more talent than you. ,[SpongeBob falls down], But since the role specifically calls for a real sponge, the part is yours. ,[SpongeBob slowly gets up], Here's the script. We start shooting tomorrow at 10. Don't be late. ,[SpongeBob rips himself in half, happily snatches the script, then jumps out of the building],

,Patrick:, SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yes I did, Patrick. ,[points to himself], I said, ""You're looking at the new face of television.""

,Patrick:, Yeah, beauty sleep!

,SpongeBob:, Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you. ,[he and Patrick walk by],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[scratches his head], What was ,that, about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual. ,[walks away],

,SpongeBob:, Yippee! ,[happily runs into the set, toward a spotlight], I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.
,Director:, ,[with a French accent], Very well. ,[through a megaphone], Lose the pants! ,[a claw snatches SpongeBob's pants, making him naked], Hans! Where's my star?! ,[a live-action hand comes out of a dressing room and grabs SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! What's happening? ,[lights turn on behind SpongeBob, showing a dirty bathroom set], Wh-wh-what's happening?!
,Director:, In this scene, you'll be cleaning bathroom mixtures.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?
,Director:, ,[mumbles angrily and quietly], Don't you get it? You ,are, the cleaning utensil. ,[SpongeBob suddenly frowns], Roll speed! ,[a red light turns on from a camera],
,Charlie:, ,[as a movie assistant, holding a movie clipboard], New Sponge Commercial: Take one. ,[closes clipboard],
,Director:, ,[through a megaphone], Action!
,Announcer:, ,[off-screen], Oh, no! Your bathroom is a disaster. Get it cleaned up fast with...the new sponge! ,[while on camera, SpongeBob groans,] Household chores are a snap with new sponge. It cleans sinks. ,[sink shines after being cleaned by a now dirty SpongeBob], Just look at that shine! New sponge cuts through even the toughest grime and grit. New sponge also cleans showers! ,[SpongeBob screams while cleaning the shower, which shines too], Ha, ha! That tile looks good as new! ,[SpongeBob sighs, tired], But best of all, new sponge can make any toilet sparkle! ,[as SpongeBob hears this, he looks at the toilet dirty inside before going straight in],
,SpongeBob:, Nooo! ,[he suddenly stops right before he goes in], I can't do this!
,Director:, ,[through a megaphone], Cut!
,SpongeBob:,  I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.
,Director:, ,Was,? You said you were professional actor.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm not. ,[puts on his work hat], I am a fry cook. ,[holds up his spatula], That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister. ,[walks away],

,Mr. Krabs:, Boy, what are you going on about?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles], I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go.
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition. ,[SpongeBob happily nods],

,SpongeBob:, Ooh, I know. I'll protect ,his leg!, ,(32), From harm, incognito.
,[SpongeBob pulls on the string, pops the balloon and flies into a nearby trashcan. He sees Fred is going to step in the oil puddle. He jumps out and falls flat onto the oil puddle so Fred wouldn't slip on it.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[as Fred steps on him], Ow, ow.
,[SpongeBob, now covered in oil, gets up and sees Fred is going to slip on a banana peel. He slides underneath him and eats the banana peel. Fred is about to step on a pile of sea urchins. SpongeBob slides underneath him and shields him from the pointy spikes. SpongeBob sticks out his tongue and its covered with sea urchins. He sees Fred about to step on a foothold trap. SpongeBob steps in and gets into the trap to prevent Fred from stepping in it.],
,SpongeBob:, Yowch! ,[groans],
,[SpongeBob continues to follow Fred and hops over to the place he works at: A construction factory.],
,Fred:, Hey, everybody, look who's back!
,Construction workers:, ,My leg!, ,(33), (25)
,[As Fred goes to begin his job, SpongeBob, who is shaped like Fred, continues to follow him. He hides behind the drilling machine just as Fred is preparing to work. Fred begins his job by pushing logs through the drilling machine.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[rips himself in half], This is his job?! Oh, no. Not safe. Must think. ,[puts on a fake mustache and construction helmet; talks in a deep voice], Welcome back, Fred. ,Nice leg, ,(34), work. But you know, it's a lot safer if you use a...,[pulls out a table leg], ,table leg, ,(35), instead.
,Fred:, Wow! Really?
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Now Fred, I wouldn't pull ,your leg!, ,(36), Watch this. ,[pushes the log in the drilling machine, but ends up getting caught in the blades], Huh?
,[With SpongeBob jamming the machine, it starts to overload and the construction workers flee the factory. The factory unleashes a devastating explosion. The smoke clears and SpongeBob pops out from the debris.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], Well, at least ,Fred's leg!, ,(37), is safe. ,[collapse on the ground; as he collapsed, he is cut into several pieces of wood],
,[The scene changes to Fred receiving therapy from a octopus named Dr. Charley Horse.],
,Fred:, ,My leg!, ,(38), (26) Is really stressing out, Dr. Charley Horse.
,Dr. Charley Horse:, ,[examining Fred's leg], Hmm. Uh-huh. ,[twists Fred's leg and bite it], You're right, Fred. It's so tense. But I've got just the remedy. Take off your shoes and follow me.
,[Fred takes off his shoes and follows Dr. Charley Horse. SpongeBob and Patrick pop out of Fred's shoes.],
,Patrick:, ,[wearing a gas mask], So far this plan stinks.
,SpongeBob:, This is no time to be smelling stinks, Patrick. I need to protect ,Fred's leg!, ,(39), And I can't do it alone.
,Dr. Charley Horse:, The only way to relax ,your leg!, ,(40), Is to walk on... ,[removes the rug and reveals a patch of burning, hot coals underneath], hot coals.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hot coals?!
,[SpongeBob goes to protect Fred while Patrick hides in a sock.],
,Dr. Charley Horse:, Now, Fred, close your eyes, and repeat after me the ancient mantra: ,My feet, ,(41), are cold. ,My feet, ,(42), are cold.
,Fred and Dr. Charley Horse:, ,My feet, ,(43), are cold.
,Fred:, ,My feet, ,(44), are cold. ,[stretches his foot out over the hot coals],
,[SpongeBob gasps and lays himself underneath Fred's feet as he prepares to walk on the hot coals.],
,Fred:, ,My feet, ,(45), are cold. ,[walks on top of SpongeBob as he burns], ,My feet, ,(46), are cold.
,SpongeBob:, Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
,Fred:, ,My feet, ,(47), are cold.
,[Fred makes it to the other end of the hot coals. SpongeBob hops out screaming in pain as his body is on fire. He flies around Fred.],
,Fred:, Whoa! ,[falls on the hot coals], ,My butt!, ,(48),
,[SpongeBob flies around Dr. Charley Horse, accidentally making him step on the hot coals.],
,Dr. Charley Horse:, ,[his voice gets higher and starts to shrink as he walks on the hot coals], Oh, ,my feet, ,(49), are cold, ,my feet, ,(50), are cold, ,my feet, ,(51), are cold, ,my feet, ,(52), are cold! ,[disappears; forms a word above the coals and whispers], Transcendence.
,Fred:, Ooh.
,[The scene changes to Fred walking in the streets in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick appearance in disguises as bodyguards.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[imitates static], All quiet on the right side.
,Patrick:, ,[imitates static], All quiet on the left side. ,[bashes Bubble Bass out of the way], Sorry, sir.
,[SpongeBob moves an old woman out of the way.],
,Old woman:, Oh!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, ma'am.
,Fred:, Hey, what's going on here?
,[A girl scout appears in front of them.],
,Girl Scout:, Would you like to buy some cookies?
,SpongeBob:, Mayday, ,Chicken Leg!, ,(53), (41) We got a situation on the griddle! ,[wraps his body around Fred's leg],
,Patrick:, ,[grabs the box of cookies], I got the weapon! ,[the girl scout bites his leg], Yow!
,[The girl scout brutally beats Patrick up and whacks him around on the ground while holding his leg with her teeth. She heavily pants like a wild savage beast until picks up the box and returns to her sweet innocent self. She skips away and Fred removes SpongeBob's glasses.],
,Fred:, SpongeBob? Why are you following ,my leg?!, ,(54), (27) , (42) [pulls SpongeBob off his leg],
,SpongeBob:, Fred, you have to listen to me. ,Your leg!, ,(55), (43) Is in constant danger. Isn't that so, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I think I hurt ,my leg., ,(56), (28) , (44) [shows the bite mark on his leg],
,SpongeBob and Fred:, Your what?
,Patrick:, ,[screams], ,My leg!, ,(57), (29) (45)

,Fred:, ,[sobs], Aww, gee, some guys get all the lucky breaks. ,[kicks an empty can in SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, ,[pulls the can off his face], At least you know that ,your leg's!, ,(58), (46) Perimeter is secured.
,Fred:, I know. I just miss being at the hospital.
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Fred:, Well, secretly...
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! ,[leans closer to listen],
,Fred:, ,[whispers], I'm in love with a nurse.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, you're in love with a nurse? Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! ,[forms into a heart and sighs; a cupid arrow pops SpongeBob back to his normal form], Fred, I've got an idea. Why don't we hurt ,your leg!, ,(59), (47) So you can be reunited with your lady fair?
,Fred:, Let's do it! And we should step on it. It's almost time for her break.
,SpongeBob:, I'd say it's almost time for ,your, break.
,[SpongeBob and Fred share a laugh. SpongeBob takes out a toy hammer and hits Fred's leg with it, but it didn't do any physical harm.],
,SpongeBob:, I should probably use something stronger.
,Fred:, Yeah, probably.
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Fred climbing over the wall at Bikini Bottom Jail. SpongeBob taps the shoulder of a nearby convict working on the rocks.],
,Convict:, Hmm?
,[Fred stretches out his leg and SpongeBob quietly explains to the convict to hit it with his hammer.],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh?
,Convict:, Hmm? Mm-mm.
,[SpongeBob grabs the hammer and goes to hit Fred's leg with it. But the hammer slips off his hand and it lands on the convict's foot. The screen becomes black and white and like a silent movie, the convict words ,""My Leg!"", ,(60), (30) (48) appears on the screen when he screams. The ambulance arrives again. The paramedics climb out, throw the convict in, and drive away. SpongeBob and Fred snap their fingers in disgust. The scene changes to Fred and SpongeBob at Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob has three jellyfish in a net and battery chargers attached to it. He puts two other battery chargers on Fred's leg in attempt to have the jellyfish sting it.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out a stick], Hmm. ,[pokes the net],
,[The jellyfish come out of the net and repeatedly stings SpongeBob. SpongeBob comes back, now incredibly swollen, and snaps his finger in disgust. The scene changes to Fred sprinkling salt on his leg. SpongeBob rings the bell and the Alaskan Bull Worm appears. But instead of biting Fred's leg, it licks the salt off. Fred snaps his fingers in disgust. The scene changes to SpongeBob tying Fred's leg to the railroad tracks.],
,SpongeBob:, Trust me, Fred, ,your leg!, ,(61), (49) Is as good as broken.
,Fred:, Oh, my sweet nurse angel. I'll be there soon, my love!
,SpongeBob:, And here comes the love train, right on schedule!
,[A train with heart steaming out comes riding down the tracks. Just as the train gets closer, Tom the robot appears. Tom stops the train and throws it off the track.],
,Tom (robot):, Don't hurt ,your leg!, ,(62), (50) Don't hurt ,your leg!, ,(63), (51)
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Robot, that is very rude. How are we supposed to break ,Fred's leg!, ,(64), (52) Now?
,[Tom's head explodes in anger.],
,Fred:, He's just afraid if I hurt ,my leg!, ,(65), (31) (53) The doctor will replace it with ,his leg!, ,(66), (54)
,SpongeBob:, Oh, is that all? Shucks, he can have ,my leg!,  ,(67), (32) (55) It'll grow back. ,[pulls his left leg off], Boink! ,[sticks his leg on Tom], Enjoy.
,Tom (robot):, ,[laughing], Thank you, sponge man. This one is even better than ,my leg!, ,(68), (33) (56)
,[The ambulance arrives again. The paramedics climb out, throw Tom in, and float away.],
,Fred:, Aw, it's no use, SpongeBob. Maybe the nurse and me were never meant to be.
,SpongeBob:, Now, don't put your tail between ,your legs!, ,(69), (57) Just yet, Fred. I've got the perfect plan to get you back to the hospital. Okay, here's what we do... ,[his left leg grows back, but it's smaller than normal], Hey, ,my leg!, ,(70), (34) (58)
,[The ambulance falls back down, crashing on top of Fred. The paramedics climb out, throw SpongeBob on the side, and drive away, leaving Fred with some tire marks.],
,Fred:, ,My head and torso!, ,(71), Wow, that's crazy. They hit me everywhere except ,my legs!, ,(72), (35) (59)
,[The paramedics grab Fred and drive away. The scene changes to the hospital where SpongeBob, Patrick, the convict, and Tom the robot have their legs casted up. Fred, however, has his entire body casted up except for his legs.],
,Fred:, ,[sighs], Thank you, SpongeBob. If it wasn't for you, I never would have made it back to my angel goddess.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't thank me, Fred. ,Your leg!, ,(73), (60) Did all the heavy lifting. I can't wait to meet this angel goddess of yours.
,Fred:, Well, wait no longer, SpongeBob. Hello, Nurse Bazooka!

,Convict:, No!
,[Tom and the convict tremble in fear, but Fred doesn't seem to be afraid of her at all.],
,Fred:, You know, this reminds me of a song.
,[Fred takes out a ukulele and begins to play music. Tom and the convict attempt to dig themselves out of the hospital to escape Nurse Bazooka, but eventually decides to join in the music. Fred saws his face out through the cast.],
,Fred:, ♪When I met you, my fingers went numb and my arms were all aloof. But I tripped over your heart. And now, my loneliness went poof. Because... ,My leg, ,(74), (36) (61) is in love!

"Narrator:,  Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed the health inspector. ,[laughs evilly. Stormy night becomes calm day], It was a bright and sunny morning. ,[scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where a fish drives up and stops in front of the restaurant. The scene zooms into his badge that reads 'Health Inspector'],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Taking a bath in money], Ah...That smells like... ,[gasps], ...the health inspector! ,[Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob in a yellow towel], Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here! ,[both are peeking out the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is writing on a clipboard], If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry. ,[eyes widen], The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
,Mr. Krabs:, You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son? ,[pushes SpongeBob out the door], Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him. ,[SpongeBob walks up to the health inspector, who is still writing on his clipboard at the table],
,SpongeBob:, What can I get for you...handsome?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[facepalms], We're doomed.
,Health Inspector:, I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walking backwards back into the kitchen], Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up! ,[SpongeBob enters the kitchen, where Krabs waits], He wants one of everything.
,Mr. Krabs:, Then we'll give him a smorgasbord! ,[holds up a tray of a patty, a drink, some fries, and coral bits], The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake! ,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run up to the health inspector],
,SpongeBob:, Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir! ,[stuffs it in the inspector's mouth],
,Mr. Krabs:, The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven. ,[stuffs it in the inspector's mouth],
,SpongeBob:, The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite. ,[stuffs it in the inspector's mouth],
,Mr. Krabs:, Fresh Sludge Pudding? ,[stuffs it in the inspector's mouth],
,SpongeBob:, More Diet Red Tide? ,[stuffs it in the inspector's mouth],
,Mr. Krabs:, Some Fried Flotsam? ,[stuffs it in the inspector's mouth],
,Health Inspector:, Please, gentlemen! ,[swallows all the food in his mouth], Leave me to finish my work in peace. ,[clicks his pen, which is actually a fork that comes out. Later, the health inspector has eaten everything on the table and belches],
,SpongeBob:, And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
,Health Inspector:, ,[writes on his clipboard], So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.
,SpongeBob:, ,[open kitchen door], He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[picks up SpongeBob], Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear! ,[both dance off then leapfrog over each other, across the screen then do the can-can in dresses until a news report comes on tv],
,Johnny Elaine:, We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man, who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now. ,[Mr. Krabs gets angry],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Yells], Free food?!
,SpongeBob:, Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
,Mr. Krabs:, You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!
,SpongeBob:, Duped!
,Mr. Krabs:, Bamboozled!
,SpongeBob:, We've been smeckledorfed!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's not even a word, and I agree with ya! ,[both look through the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is wiping his mouth off, finishing his drink, and cleaning his teeth with a toothpick], Look at him. I bet he never changes his underpants.
,SpongeBob:, I bet he bites whale bubbles.
,Mr. Krabs:, I bet his mom bought him that hat. ,[holds up a krabby patty], If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one. ,[flicks the top bun off and puts a some volcano sauce on the patty], You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
,SpongeBob:, It doesn't seem right... ,[holds up a bottle of seahorse radish], ...but it feels so good! ,[dumps a spoonful on the patty], Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ohh, hold on, I've got a ton of toenail clippings in my office! ,[runs off as SpongeBob drops the patty in the toilet],
,SpongeBob:, Oops, I dropped it in the toilet! ,[Mr. Krabs runs in with a smelly sock],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks! ,[scene cuts to showing a disgusting krabby patty with what appears to be pimples and green meat], Why, that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned! ,[both are wearing clothespins on their noses],
,SpongeBob:, I call it the 'Nasty Patty'. ,[both laugh],
,Health Inspector:, Hey, hurry up with that patty! ,[SpongeBob runs in with the patty],
,SpongeBob:, ,[speaking quickly], Here you go, sir, enjoy. ,[runs back into the kitchen],
,Health Inspector:, Ah, hello, delicious. Come to papa. ,[a fly flies into his throat. He starts to choke],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[listening from the kitchen], Listen, he ate it! ,[both look out from the kitchen window], Oh, look at him choke! ,[both laugh], Look at him suffer! ,[both keep laughing.], Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face. ,[Health inspector slips on some packets of condiments and bangs his head on the table. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are still laughing. Another TV bulletin comes on],
,A Realistic Fish Head:, We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash. The fake inspector has been captured. Here is his picture. ,[picture is shown on the tv], If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.
,SpongeBob:, Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], I don't think he'll be laughin', boy.
,SpongeBob:, Why, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, Because that patty killed him! ,[both scream, check the inspector again, then scream again],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?
,Mr. Krabs:, What's this ""we"" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!
,SpongeBob:, But you told me to give it to him!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you could've talked me out of it!
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me. ,[Mr. Krabs grabs him],
,Mr. Krabs:, Get a hold of yerself, boy! We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs on a muddy hill.], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[disgusted], Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y! ,[gagging and shrieking while constantly spraying it with disinfectant], Eww...eww...,[SpongeBob is dragging the body by a tissue],
,Mr. Krabs:, This should be far enough. Now, get diggin'! ,[hands SpongeBob a shovel],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir. ,[while digging a big hole, his shovel hits something],
,Mr. Krabs:, What's the holdup down there?
,SpongeBob:, There's a big rock in the way!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, toss it out and get back to diggin'!
,SpongeBob:, ,[salutes], Aye aye, sir! ,[grunting as he tosses the huge rock behind him],
,Health Inspector:, Oh... where am I? ,[grunts as the rock hits him in the head knocking him out again, groans],
,Mr. Krabs:, Somethin' ain't quite right.
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean, Mr. Krabs? ,[health inspector's head is out of the ground],
,Mr. Krabs:, His head's stickin' out!
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob covers his head with more sand], Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air.
,Mr. Krabs:, They don't need air where he's going.
,SpongeBob:, Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh...
,SpongeBob:, ,[bawling], What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that. Why...why...why?! ,[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean ,no one, can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me. And worst of all, it'll be the end of me!
,Officer Malley:, ,[shines a flashlight on them], Stop right where you are! I'm afraid we're going to have to arrest the two of you. ,[SpongeBob hangs on Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail! ,[Mr. Krabs covers his mouth],
,Mr. Krabs:, And what would be the charges?
,Officer Malley:, For not being at the Krusty Krab to whip us up a couple of dee...licious Krabby Patties! ,[both police officers laugh. Mr. Krabs laughs nervously],
,Mr. Krabs:, Laugh, boy. ,[SpongeBob laughs. It rains. The rain makes the health inspector slide down the hill],
,Officer Nancy:, Put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back. ,[SpongeBob is still laughing until Mr. Krabs hits him. Mr. Krabs opens the trunk and SpongeBob puts the shovel in it],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, listen carefully. We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool, understand? ,[SpongeBob looks down and and goes in shock],
,SpongeBob:, Can I lose my cool now?
,Mr. Krabs:, Why? ,[SpongeBob points to the health inspector, who is now down the hill. Both scream, Mr. Krabs grabs the body and gives it to SpongeBob], Put it in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy.
,Officer Malley:, What's the holdup back there? ,[Mr. Krabs starts talking to him as a distraction],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Neptune! Get away! ,[throws the inspector in the trunk then sprays himself with disinfectant.], Ooh...ahh-ahh... ,[Slams the trunk on the health inspector, who was waking up], A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk. ,[laughs nervously],
,Mr. Krabs:, All set. ,[SpongeBob slides in almost motionlessly],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh... ,[starts to shake],
,Officer Nancy:, You okay there, little fella?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, he gets carsick real easy.
,Officer Malley:, Well, buckle up and we'll drive real smooth-like. ,[drives off],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab I want you to take that ,[winks, says angrily], ,shovel, and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...er... I mean, ,stow it, in the freezer. Un-der-stand?
,SpongeBob:, I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo... ,[is about to say ""body""],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs SpongeBob's lips], ...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, Same thing, put 'em in the freezer. ,[Nancy stares at them funny. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is bringing the body to the back],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, man, this is so gross! ,[tries the handle on the door, but there is a lock], The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?! ,[scene cuts to inside the Krusty Krab with Mallay and Nancy laughing. SpongeBob enters with a big hat where the health inspector is in it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy there, SpongeBob. Heh. I thought you were out back taking care of that ,[angrily], ,shovel,. ,[twitches & winks his eyes],
,SpongeBob:, Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh. ,[his hat sags over, and SpongeBob puts it back in position], So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now. ,[walks to the kitchen very carefully],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okey-dokey, SpongeBob.
,Officer Malley:, Is that boy okay?
,Officer Nancy:, He's actin' a little funny.
,Mr. Krabs:, Funny? Oh. Yeah. ,[laughs], He's a real cut-up, that one. He knows how to keep the crew in stitches. Good one, boy! Always on, that one. There's no off on his funny switch. ,[laughs, SpongeBob stumbles with the Health Inspector in his hat as Mallay, Nancey and Mr. Krabs look on], Oh, ah, oh stop it. Oh, you're, you're killin' me. ,[laughs, SpongeBob is trying to get through a door but his hat is too big. Mr. Krabs bangs the cash drawer open], Oh! Look, I almost forgot! It's open cash register night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register! ,[hands out the money. SpongeBob gets his hat inside the kitchen],
,Officer Malley:, ,[listens to his walkie-talkie], 86 those patties, Krabs. We just got a call about two ghouls burying a stiff over by Shallow Grave Road.
,Officer Nancy:, I want a soda. ,[Mr. Krabs gives her one],
,Mr. Krabs:, Here's your soda. Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now.
,Officer Nancy:, Hey, there's no ice.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[nervous], Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want, you want ice? Is that what you want? ,[SpongeBob slides on screen],
,SpongeBob:, The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
,Officer Nancy:, ,[walks to the kitchen], I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, ri...? ,[Mr. Krabs runs to block the freezer door],
,Mr. Krabs:, There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth!
,Officer Nancy:, Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder!
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay! I confess! ,[points to SpongeBob], SpongeBob killed him!
,SpongeBob:, What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!
,Mr. Krabs:, He was insane, out of control. He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.
,SpongeBob:, It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
,Mr. Krabs:, Put him down now, he's a mad dog!
,SpongeBob:, He wears curlers to bed!
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait! It's not what you think!
,Officer Nancy:, What are you two talking about?
,Mr. Krabs:, We killed the health inspector, buried him, and then stuffed his body in the freezer.
,Officer Nancy:, You mean in here? ,[opens the freezer, but it's empty],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's empty?
,Officer Nancy:, Is this some kind of a joke?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah...a joke! ,[SpongeBob giggles],
,Officer Nancy:, Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out. ,[everyone laughs. Just then a fish walks up moaning],

,Health Inspector:, You guys should...
,Officer Malley:, ,[hits the inspector with an anchor], Take that, you zombie! ,[inspector now has a huge bump on his head],
,Officer Nancy:, I'll take it from here. ,[hits the inspector with a barrel], Die, zombie!
,Officer Malley:, Good police work, officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.
,Health Inspector:, Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this. ,[gives Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob a note with the word 'pass' on it checked],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
,Everyone:, Hooray! ,[everyone walks out of the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really.
,Health Inspector:, ,[tries to crawl out], Oh, boy, I'd like a Krabby Patty. ,[door slams in his face. Scene cuts to above water where it’s stormy again],
,Narrator:, Well, that's the story. Yes, they are all idiots, aren't they?

"Johnny Elaine:, ,[on TV], News flash! A severe rip current may soon touch down in Bikini Bottom! Residents are warned to bar all windows and stay indoors!
,[The rip current sends the television flying off screen. Numerous objects like Dave hammering boards on his window, a can of beans, a bone, a house, and a cow. The television comes back with Frank the Whale following behind.],
,Johnny Elaine:, ,[on TV], Save yourselves!
,[Below the rip current, Mr. Krabs, who appears to be in a cranky mood, is heading towards the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, rip current, schmip current! Ain't nothin'.
,[Mr. Krabs enters the restaurant and meets up with SpongeBob and Squidward.],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Mr. Krabs, do you think the rip current will hit the Krusty Krab?
,[SpongeBob makes strange moments of what will happen to the restaurant when the rip current strikes.],
,Squidward:, Uh, shouldn't we clear the docks? Or batten down the patches? Or whatever people say?
,Mr. Krabs:, Calm your waters. ,[points to the danger meter on his knee], Me sailor's knee says we're not in danger. See? Now, get back to work!
,Octavius Rex:, Excuse me. Are we in any kind of peril?
,Customer 1:, I think we should all go home.
,Mr. Krabs:, As soon as you buy some patties to go, you can go.
,Orchid:, I'll have three Krabby Patties. ,[a loud rumble shakes the restaurant], On second thought, cancel that order!
,[Mr. Krabs grabs the lady's purse and dumps her money in Squidward's cash register.],
,Mr. Krabs:, No takie-backsies! Three Krabby Patties.
,[Mr. Krabs' money detector goes off.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Me money detector! Where do ya think you're goin'? Get back in there and spend the rest of your money!
,Clay:, But I needed it for rent!
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen up, everybody! New store policy! All money brought into this store must be spent here!
,Buddy:, Tyrant!
,[Mr. Krabs sneaks up behind Buddy.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, tyrant am I? Alright, I'm a tyrant! The worst in all the seven seas! One of 'em! ,[growls],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, why is Mr. Krabs so crabby today?
,Squidward:, Probably because it's pay day.
,[Mr. Krabs grabs the microphone.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Pay day's been canceled! Now, hear this! I'm captain of the ship! Captain Krabs! And I say no rip current will ever harm the Krusty Krab!
,[Suddenly, a sunken ship flies down and the anchor crashes through the roof of the Krusty Krab. The ship pulls the restaurant off the ground and sends it flying into the air. The movements make the customers fly back and forth. Squidward gets his legs tangled to a pole. SpongeBob attempts to flip Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs struggles to hold on the register boat, but ended up getting bombarded with barrels. Despite his injuries, he checks the danger meter on his sailor's knee. He taps on it and the pointer moves to the red section.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Darn arthritis!
,[The chain snaps off the ship's anchor and the restaurant is flying out of control. Mr. Krabs falls in a barrel. The customers and Squidward struggle to hold on as the rip current carries the restaurant away from Bikini Bottom. In a desperate attempt to save everyone, SpongeBob jumps out of the kitchen and uses his teeth to make a key out of his spatula. He opens the chest and pulls down the lever. Outside, it activates sails and a rudder. SpongeBob grabs a table and uses it as a steering wheel. The restaurant is now safely being steered through the rip current. Squidward, who was squished under a customer's butt, comes down from the pole.],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, while I steer you tell everyone we're safe.
,Squidward:, ,[through microphone], It's alright now, everybody! Everything's under control now! And whatever!
,[The customers climb down the mast.],
,Octavius Rex:, Three cheers for Squidward!
,Customer 1:, The guy who saved our lives!
,Buddy:, Let's make him our new captain!
,Octavius Rex:, Hip, hip...
,Customers:, Hooray for Captain Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, Congratulations, Squidward! Uh, I mean Captain Squidward!
,[Mr. Krabs, who is still stuck in a barrel, rolls between Squidward and the customers.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What's the meanin' of this?
,Octavius Rex:, What should we do with this tyrant, Captain Squidward?
,Mr. Krabs:, Captain Squidward?
,Customer 1:, Let's flog him!
,Customers:, Yeah!
,Buddy:, Let's tie him to the mast!
,Customers:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, Let's put the past behind us and start all over!
,Customers:, No!
,Mr. Krabs:, This is mutiny! Listen here, Squidward! Fun is fun, but get me outta here!
,Squidward:, Sorry. I don't think that's the captain's job. You're on your own.
,[SpongeBob inexplicably jumps off the register boat, leaving the restaurant steering out of control.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, everybody, can we take a time out? This is Mr. Krabs we're talking about. The worst tyrant in the seven seas.
,Mr. Krabs:, You're not helpin', boy.
,SpongeBob:, You remember Mr. Krabs. He's the man who brought you the Krabby Patty.
,[The customers murmur in agreement. As SpongeBob is lecturing everyone, Mr. Krabs is being rolled back and forth in the barrel.],
,SpongeBob:, And he's the man who brought you the Double Krabby Patty. And the Krabby Patty with cheese. And the Bratty Patty for kids.
,Mr. Krabs:, Um, little help here!
,SpongeBob:, He also created the Chatty Patty for teens. And who can forget the Hatty Patty. The patty you wear as a hat.
,Thaddeus:, I wear it because I'm bald.
,Octavius Rex:, Well, I guess any man who invented the Hatty Patty can't be all bad. Okay, let's get him out.
,[But before they do so, Mr. Krabs is sliding towards the front doors and is being hurled out.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa! Man overboard! ,[screams],
,SpongeBob:, NO! MR. KRABS!
,Squidward:, Well, I guess that solves that problem.
,[Thaddeus takes off his Hatty Patty to honor Mr. Krabs' supposed death. He then eats the Hatty Patty.],
,SpongeBob:, I know you'll come back to us, Mr. Krabs!
,[The Krusty Krabs flies through the rip current and the screen fades black. The screen turns back to the inside of the restaurant.],
,SpongeBob:, Until then, ,[takes out a dollar, licks it, and pastes it on the doors], I'll leave a dollar in the window for ya.
,Octavius Rex:, Hey, it's Captain Squidward's fault that we lost the man who invented the Hatty Patty!
,Customer 1:, Yeah! We're freckled! And we say you're the tyrant now!
,Customers:, Yeah!
,Squidward:, Uh, uh, don't be hasty! Remember, I'm... I'm still the captain! The Hatty Patty was my idea!
,Octavius Rex:, But we're still stuck in this rip current!
,Customer 1:, We'll never get out!
,[Octavius Rex and the unnamed customer corners Squidward, but Squidward gets his head tangled into the spinning steering wheel.],
,Squidward:, Oh, barnacles!
,[With Squidward tangled in the steering wheel, the rudder turns left and right and the restaurant flies out of control. The customers fly back and forth again. Squidward pulls his head out of the steering and his head spins back into place. The restaurant spins out of the rip current and crash lands safely on the ground.],
,Octavius Rex:, We're alive! Captain Squidward steered us out of the rip current!
,Customer 1:, How about a cheer for Captain Squidward!
,[The customers cheer.],
,Squidward:, Thank you! Thank you! Just doin' my job as captain protecting my crew.
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Where are we?
,[SpongeBob and the customers look out the window and what they see is a beautiful landscape with plants growing everywhere. An unnamed sea creature flies around.],
,Clay:, Oh, look at that. That's amazing.
,Octavius Rex:, This neighborhood's crazy! I wonder if there are any good places to eat.
,Customer 1:, You think maybe they got a Krusty Krab around here?
,Buddy:, Hey, good idea! I could go for a Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, I'm calling the local Krusty Krab right now.
,[SpongeBob pulls part of his head off and forms it into a telephone. He dials the number. The Krusty Krab phone rings.],
,Squidward:, Hello, Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, I'd like to place an order.
,[Squidward pushes the receiver into SpongeBob's head in frustration. The receiver rings in SpongeBob's head. Suddenly, a monster appears at the front door, scaring the customers. Squidward runs away in fright, leaving a puddle of ink behind. The monster spreads its slimy tongue around the customers.],
,Octavius Rex:, Captain!
,Buddy:, You gotta save us!
,[The monster licks SpongeBob's eyeballs off his face.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Captain Squidward!
,[SpongeBob's eyes jump back on his face. Squidward is nowhere to be seen. The monster wraps his tongue all over SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Um, I know where he is.
,[SpongeBob runs into the kitchen and opens the closet. He throws everything out and pulls a box out with the word ""fragile"" on it. He opens the box and finds another box with the word ""pickles"" on it. He opens it, pulls out a jar, and takes Squidward out of the jar.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Captain, sorry to interrupt, but the crew needs you to protect them.
,Squidward:, Are you crazy? I can't fight a monster!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm afraid the crew insists, sir.
,[The customers, with random weapons, growl in anger and Squidward becomes nervous. The customers carry Squidward out of the kitchen.],
,Squidward:, I don't want to be captain! I don't want to be captain!
,[SpongeBob gives Squidward a mop for him to fight and the customers throw him out. But instead of fighting the monster like he's supposed to, he ends up getting eaten. Everyone is stunned.],
,Octavius Rex:, Well, that was anti-climatic.
,Customer 1:, Maybe he'll make the monster sick.
,Clay:, Okay. Who had their money on Captain Squidward? Pay up.
,[SpongeBob gives Clay and Buddy some of his money.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, somebody has to step up, fight that monster, and become captain! And that somebody is me!
,[SpongeBob pulls up his pants. He pulls out his left eyeball, blows on it, rubs it and puts it back on. He smells his breath, which smelled terrible. He drinks some mouth wash, gargles, and swallows it. He does karate moves but notices his shoe is untied. He ties his shoe. He trips his nails. And finally, he pulls a loose string off his pants.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what was I doing now?
,[Suddenly, everyone hears a distant scream from above. The scream turned out the but none other than Mr. Krabs, who comes crashing through the roof and landing on a table. However, Mr. Krabs is still angry about Squidward being in charge.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you're alive! Oh, welcome back, captain!
,Mr. Krabs:, Haven't you forgotten something? I am not captain anymore! Squidward is!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, uh. The monster ate him. We need a captain and that's you! Isn't that right?
,[The customers chatter in agreement.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Why would I want to be captain to such a sorry bunch of lubbers? I'm through!
,[The monster's tentacle breaks through the window.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And that's comin' out of your pay!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, this job calls for a dictator like you!
,[Mr. Krabs selfishly pouts like a spoiled child. The monster's tentacle breaks through the window again.],
,SpongeBob:, Do something, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Beg me.
,Customers:, Please, please, please!
,SpongeBob:, We're begging you! Please!
,[The monster licks everywhere and Mr. Krabs gets covered in saliva.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Not buyin' it.
,Customers:, Oh, come on! We'll do anything! Please!
,[Mr. Krabs still acts like a spoiled child and continues to pout. SpongeBob gets an idea and runs into Mr. Krabs' office. He grabs Mr. Krabs' first dime.],
,SpongeBob:, Got it! ,[runs back], Do you know what this is, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't care.
,SpongeBob:, It's the first dime you ever earned and I'm going to tear it up if you don't go back to being the meanie we need!
,Mr. Krabs:, I said I don't care.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, here goes!
,[SpongeBob attempts to break it, but to no avail. He tries to cut it with an axe, but it shatters to dust. He tries to saw it in half with a power saw, but instead it makes the saw fly off, hitting someone offscreen.],
,Unnamed man:, My leg!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha! You lose!
,[SpongeBob mopes as he is about to give up. However, he got another idea.],
,SpongeBob:, Well then, I'm gonna do the worst thing I can do to your old dime!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh yeah? What's that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], Spend it.
,[This time, Mr. Krabs reacts in a gasp and becomes nervous. SpongeBob walks over to a candy machine and is about to use his dime to spend it on candy.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no you don't! Come here!
,[Mr. Krabs jumps on SpongeBob and gives back the first dime.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, everybody! What am I?
,Customers:, Umm... uh..
,[The monster's tentacle breaks through the window again.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on! It starts with a T!
,SpongeBob:, A tree?
,[Mr. Krabs glares at SpongeBob.],
,Customer 2:, A teddy bear?
,Octavius Rex:, A tuba?
,Buddy:, You're a tyrant?
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't hear you!
,Customers:, A tyrant! ,[cheers],
,Mr. Krabs:, Correct! Alright, I'll save ya. But you gotta promise to spend most of your, all of your money right here! Got it?
,[The customers chatter in agreement. The monster breaks through the front doors and spreads his tongue all over the place, scaring the customers.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hands SpongeBob his dime], Hold on to me dime, boy-yo.
,[Mr. Krabs charges out of the restaurant and he and the monster hurls towards each other as they are ready to fight. The monster opens his mouth and eats Mr. Krabs whole. Everyone is stunned.],
,Octavius Rex:, Well, that was anti-climatic.
,Customer 1:, Again.
,[However, Mr. Krabs is still alive and is beating up the monster inside. He makes the monster spit Squidward out. Squidward frantically runs back into the restaurant. Mr. Krabs punches one of the monster's eyes out and swings down. He bounces on one of its tentacles and lands on its head. He then bangs on the monster's eyes like he's playing bongo drums. SpongeBob, Squidward, and the customers dance in rhythm. The monster shakes Mr. Krabs off his head and sends him flying into a coral plant. But Mr. Krabs comes out of the plant and flies directly into the monster's hand. The monster pulls Mr. Krabs' legs off and pulls off his right arm.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait a minute! Gimme that!
,[Mr. Krabs hits the monster on his head and makes him let go. Mr. Krabs then sends the monster flying with his severed arm and puts it back on. The monster collides with a boulder and breaks into tiny monsters. The tiny monsters run away and everyone in the Krusty Krab cheers. The scene changes to SpongeBob giving Mr. Krabs his first dime while they're sitting on the roof of the restaurant.],
,SpongeBob:, Here you go, Mr. Krabs. You earned it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, boy-yo, you believed in me. So, today will be a pay day for you.
,Squidward:, What about me?
,Mr. Krabs:, You, Ex-Captain Squidward, have gone from pay day to mayday! Mush! Every last one of ya! All the way back to Bikini Bottom! ,[laughs],
,[The episode ends with Squidward and the customers pulling the Krusty Krab back to Bikini Bottom while SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs sit on the roof.],

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A mother and a baby passes by and is greeted by a polite gentleman. A raspberry noise is heard. The mother turns and gives the gentleman an angry look, thinking it was him who made the noise. The noise is heard again. They turn and see a long line standing in the Krusty Krab. It turns out to be Mustard Day and SpongeBob is giving away mustard to the customers.],
,SpongeBob:, Mustard, mustard, step right up for your mustard! ,[flips the mustard container], Some mustard for you. Eh, eh, eh. ,[sprays mustard on a little boy's Krabby Patty],
,[The mustard forms into a t-rex and it roars mustard in the boy's face.],
,Boy:, ,[his face is covered in mustard], Cool!
,SpongeBob:, ,[flips the mustard container], A bit of the yellow for you. Doy. ,[sprays mustard on Frankie Billy's Krabby Patty],
,[The mustard forms into a sailboat. It whistles and rings its foghorn before it melts onto the patty. Frankie Billy laughs and skips away. Nancy Suzy Fish comes up and whispers something in SpongeBob's ear.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, okay. ,[winks at Nancy Suzy Fish], Eh. ,[hops and spins the mustard container before spraying the mustard into a handsome man], And a Mr. Mustard for you.
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, ,[purrs as walks with her Mr. Mustard while licking him], Mmm, yummy.
,SpongeBob:, Hyah! ,[attempts to give mustard to Frank, but the mustard container is all out and it cough out a small drop of mustard],
,Customers:, Aw.
,SpongeBob:, Hang on, folks, I'll be right back with more mustard. ,[hops on the mustard container and drives on it like a car], Whoo! ,[drives to the kitchen and goes to the condiment cabinet], Let's see. Ketchup. ,[slides ketchup door to mayonnaise door], Mayonnaise. ,[rolls up mayonnaise door to mustard door], Oh, mustard. ,[opens doors mustard door to find Mr. Krabs in it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you use up all me mustard?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stammering nervously], What?
,Squidward:, ,[filing his tentacle], Oh, who gives a flying fish about mustard?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], But Squidward, without mustard I wouldn't be able to make a—
,Mr. Krabs:, Krabby Patty! That's right, you're both hereby ordered to go down into the mustard mines! And bring me back more mustard!
,Squidward:, Mustard mines?
,Patrick:, ,[comes out of the condiment cabinet and is covered with mustard], Mmm, mustard. ,[takes a container off his head and grabs a packet of mustard], Uh... Ah. ,[squirts mustard in his mouth, eats it and burps],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[wipes mustard off his face], And you are going down to the mustard mines too.
,Walter Haddock:, ,[offscreen], I wouldn't do that if I was you. ,[creepily comes in and spits on the grill],
,[SpongeBob wipes the grill clean.],
,Walter Haddock:, That old mustard mine is cursed.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hugs Mr. Krabs in fear], Cursed?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pushes SpongeBob away], What kind of curse?
,Walter Haddock:, It's, uh, er, one of those—The Mummy's Curse.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[snickers], There's no such thing as mummies.
,Walter Haddock:, ,[holds up a creepy picture of his mother], We've all got mummies. Eh? ,[giggles], Mm-hmm. I've been in that mine. No one that enters gets out alive. ,[makes a creepy smile as a shrieking noise is heard; a spider crawls into his mouth and thunder claps],
,SpongeBob:, You got out and you're alive.
,Walter Haddock:, Ah, but am I?
,Patrick:, Yeah, you're standing right there.
,Walter Haddock:, But am I? ,[walks away in a creepy fashion],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, you're right—,[notices that he's gone, but he sees his foot], Hmm.
,Squidward:, I see your foot.
,Walter Haddock:, ,[slides his foot back], No, you don't.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, his foot's gone!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward at the entrance to the mustard mines.],
,Squidward:, ,[looks at the map], This map doesn't show us where the mustard vein is located. Well, let's just start picking.
,Patrick:, ,[picking his nose], Way ahead of you, pal.
,Squidward:, Ugh. ,[turns and looks at the map again],
,[Patrick reaches into his nostril and picks out his brain.],
,Patrick:, Ooh. ,[smears his brain on Squidward's shirt],
,[Squidward turns and grunts in disgust. Patrick gets scared and runs over to SpongeBob. Squidward picks up his pickaxe and heads into the mustard mines.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[gasps and skips into the mines], ♪Oh, a-mining we will go! The mustard, it will flow! ,[bounce up and down really hard], With pick and axe without the facts! There's nothing that we know! Ta-da!♪
,[SpongeBob and Patrick's violent bouncing causes a landslide and falling rocks seals off the entrance, much to their horror.],
,Squidward:, ,[Shocked and angry], Huh?! You nitwits! How will we get out now?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick's realize their mistake as Patrick gets worried.],
,Patrick:, Ah, we're trapped in a mine! We'll never get out!
,[Patrick goes into frantic panic and runs up and down the mine walls. He curls in a fetal position and acts crazy. He punches his chest and passes out.],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs and goes to check on Patrick], Krabby Patty, stat.
,[SpongeBob takes out the ingredients and makes a perfect Krabby Patty. He gives it to Squidward and he feeds Patrick the patty. Patrick swallows the patty and slowly wakes up.],
,Squidward:, He's coming 'round.
,Patrick:, ,[weakly], Squidward. I—I need—
,Squidward:, What can I get for you?
,Patrick:, ,[pulls out the Krabby Patty from his mouth and stupidly], I need a little mustard for the Krabby Patty.
,Squidward:, ,[drops Patrick down in disgust at his idiocy], Why do I even bother? Maybe there's a back door.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Hey, wait for us!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to Squidward.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa.
,[They stop at a long, deep shaft.],
,Squidward:, I wonder how deep it is.
,SpongeBob:, I'll check. ,[picks up a pebble, goes over the edge and falls into the shaft], Wahhh! ,[appears next to Squidward and Patrick], Don't bother jumping. That shaft has no bottom. Let's take the escalator.
,Squidward:, ,[pushes SpongeBob and Patrick aside], All right, spread out! ,[goes on the escalator],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick follow and go on the escalator with Squidward. They see coal miners go up the escalator.],
,SpongeBob:, Coal miners.
,[They see sulfur miners go up the escalator. The awful smell from the sulfur makes SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward cover their noses.],
,SpongeBob:, Ew.
,Patrick:, Sulfur miners.
,SpongeBob:, Phew.
,[They see a group of kids go up the escalator.],
,SpongeBob:, Unaccompanied minors. ,[drum sting],
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward walk off the escalator.],
,Squidward:, All right, let's get to work, chowderheads.
,[They go in separate directions while bumping into each other for a little bit. SpongeBob digs up a yellow rock with his pickaxe.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I found something yellow. ,[pulls the yellow rock out of the wall; he was happy at first, but turned sad], Never mind, it's just gold. ,[throws it away],
,Patrick:, All I'm getting is dumb old diamonds. ,[throws and kicks several diamonds],
,SpongeBob:, ,[carrying a handful of gold nuggets], This must be the Mummy's Curse that old guy was talking about. ,[throws the gold nuggets in the stalagmite],
,Squidward:, Gold and diamonds? ,[digs up sand from the wall], Gold dust! No, no, it's just sand.
,[Up above the surface, Ryan is minding his own business playing in the sandbox. Suddenly, the sand begins to form a whirlpool and sucks Ryan down underneath.],
,Ryan:, Whoa! ,[screaming],
,[Ryan comes out from the hole Squidward dug up and he runs around in panic.],
,Squidward:, ,[upon seeing Ryan], Ah.
,[Ryan continues to run and scream in panic until he calms down when he goes up the escalator.],
,Squidward:, Uh, what was that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], The greatest treasure of all, a child.
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward resume their task. All of a sudden, SpongeBob begins to sniff out something. He sniffs the wall and punctures a hole on it with the pickaxe. It turns out that he dug up a payphone underneath the wall. The phone rings and SpongeBob answers it.],
,SpongeBob:, Hello?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[with angry customers yelling in the background], SpongeBob, where's me mustard?
,Jennifer Millie:, I want some mus—,[Mr. Krabs pushes her away with his foot],
,SpongeBob:, On the way, sir, as soon was we find it. ,[hangs up but answers again], Love you. ,[hangs up again],
,Squidward:, Oh, we'll never find that mustard vein. ,[pokes the wall with the pickaxe and the wall crumbles into a hole, leading him to the subway], Oh, what is this? ,[wonders around the subway],
,Subway PA:, Local train approaching station.
,[Deep in the tunnel, a train emerges and stops in front of Squidward. The train opens its doors, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick already on board. Squidward stares at them in shock, wondering how they managed to get on so quick and afford a train ride.],
,SpongeBob:, Hurry up, Squidward, before the doors close!
,Patrick:, It's the last train of the night!
,SpongeBob:, Do you have a metro card?
,[Squidward frantically searches for a metro card until he finds one under his shirt.],
,Squidward:, Ah! I got it! ,[tries to scan his card, but the tumblers keep beeping red],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Squidward!
,[Squidward tries all his might to scan his card as he watches the train doors slowly close in horror.],
,Subway PA:, Watch the closing doors.
,[Squidward buffs up his arm and the tumbler finally turns green, approving access to it. Squidward runs through the tumblers and frantically heads to the train.],
,SpongeBob:, Faster, Squidward, faster!
,[Squidward makes it, but the doors close on his neck, leaving his body being dragged outside of the moving train.],
,Patrick:, Hey, Squidward, you really should watch the closing doors.
,[Squidward growls and hisses at Patrick in complete anger and frustration, as Patrick backs away.],
,Subway PA:, This is a local mining train making all stops between Coal and Limestone. Next stop, Condiments.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's our stop.
,[The train stops at the condiments vein. The doors open. SpongeBob steps over a battened Squidward and heads to the condiments vein. Patrick runs out and steps on Squidward, but grabs him by the feet.],
,Patrick:, Come on, Squidward!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick scurry into the condiments vein while Squidward, being carried by Patrick, hits his head on the sign. Patrick sets Squidward down. Squidward walks around in a dizzy fashion, but pulls himself together. Squidward knocks on the wall and punctures a hole with his pickaxe. Mayonnaise comes out of the wall and sprays into Squidward's face.],
,Squidward:, Hmm. ,[sticks out his tongue], Ah, la, hmm. ,[licks the mayo], Ah! I've struck mayo!
,[SpongeBob punctures a hole on a different wall and a drop of hot sauce flies onto his tongue. He tastes the dropping and his body flares up, burning himself to a crisp.],
,SpongeBob:, Hot sauce. ,[his body crumbles into ashes],
,[Patrick goes to puncture a wall with his pickaxe, but flips over and falls to the ground; his pickaxe punctures a hole on the wall and ketchup spews out.],
,Patrick:, I struck blood! ,[grabs some of the ketchup and tastes it], Oh, no, it's ketchup! ,[slurps some more],
,SpongeBob:, We're getting close. ,[punctures a hole on the ground and mustard comes out; he takes a sample of mustard], Oh. ,[licks the mustard], Mustard. Ahhh! I struck mustard!
,Squidward:, Mustard?
,Patrick:, Mustard?
,SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward:, ,[dancing around in circles while twisting SpongeBob's body], ♪Look at all the mustard flow! Look at all the mustard flow! That golden yellow fatty acid treat!♪
,[SpongeBob unravels himself, sending Squidward and Patrick flying to another wall. SpongeBob warms himself up and goes to crack open the ground again. But the ground was so thick that is disintegrates his pickaxe.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, what are we gonna do now?
,Squidward:, I think we better use our heads.
,Patrick:, Let's use my head. ,[pulls his tongue and his pointy head revs up like a power drill],
,[SpongeBob and Squidward go to use Patrick's drilling head to drill a hole in the ground. When all of a sudden, they hear a moaning sound. Smoke fumes around the tunnels and a shadowy creature appears.],
,SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward:, The mummy!
,[The smoke clears and the shadowy figure reveals himself to be none other than the crazy old prospector, Walter Haddock.],
,Walter Haddock:, Stop!
,[Walter Haddock leaps in front of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, pulls a cork out from his mouth and plugs up the hole in the ground.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], It's the Mummy's Curse guy!
,Walter Haddock:, There ain't no curse! I just tried to discourage you chuckleheads from mining this mustard!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I get it, 'cause the mummy wants the mustard. Mystery solved.
,SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward:, Hurrah!
,Walter Haddock:, ,[twitches his eye], 'Tain't no mummy! This mustard is sitting on top of 20 million pounds of pressure! If you open her up, she's gonna blow sky high!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no curse. No mummy. And no mustard. ,[sniffs], And I'll have to find another job! ,[cries and blows his nose on Squidward's nose],
,Squidward:, ,[pulls his nose back], Stop. Don't you see? This old coot wants all the mustard for himself! Now uncork that mustard!
,Walter Haddock:, Hmm? ,[growls],
,Squidward:, Oh, put your fists down, old man. I'm not gonna hurt you.
,Walter Haddock:, Hyah! ,[punches Squidward in the face],
,[Squidward falls over.],
,SpongeBob:, You were right, Squidward, you're not gonna hurt him.
,Squidward:, ,[gets up and is really angry], Why you— ,[gets punched in the face again], Ow! ,[gets punched again], I'm gonna— ,[gets punched and his head spins; then he gets punched again],
,SpongeBob:, Go, Squidward, you're winning! You're not hurting him at all!
,Patrick:, ,[buffs up], Let me try not hurting him. ,[grabs Squidward and throws him aside], Come on, old-timer! You know you want a piece of me! ,[Walter Haddock punches Patrick on the head and sends him flying and crashing onto the hole in the ground], Oh.
,Walter Haddock:, ,[in pain],Ow, that hurt!
,Patrick:, ,[Getting up],I hurt him! ,[Stupidly and disappointed], That means I lose.
,[Suddenly, the ground underneath begins the shake, due to the force of Patrick's fall. Cracks begins to form and Walter Haddock dodges the incoming stalagmites from the ground. The mustard from underground begins to build up pressure and is about to erupt.],
,SpongeBob:, No, no, no, no, no, no, no! ,[tries to hold down the pressure, but the mustard begins to fill up inside his body], Whoa....!
,Walter Haddock:, Adiós, muchachos!
,[Walter Haddock laughs manically and bounces around until he calms down when he goes up the elevator. Cracks form underneath Squidward and the crack uncovers a payphone next to him.],
,Squidward:, Hmm. ,[phone rings and he answers it], I'll get it. Hello.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[on a mast above the angry customers], Where's me mustard?!
,Squidward:, Um...
,[Pressure builds up as SpongeBob's body grows bigger and bigger from the upcoming mustard. Patrick tries his best by corking up the holes. At the Krusty Krab, the customers continue to riot against Mr. Krabs. One customer is chopping the mast down with his axe. The screen zooms out to reveal volcanic pocket of mustard underneath the Krusty Krab.],
,Squidward:, Your mustard is coming right up.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[as the mast falls], When?!
,Squidward:, Now?
,[SpongeBob can't hold the pressure much longer as his eyes fill up with mustard. The ground under the Krusty Krab rumbles and erupts a geyser of mustard through the roof. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce up and down on top of the geyser.],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! Yee-ha! Yeah!
,[The mustard fills up the Krusty Krab inside. The customers are now satisfied and go to swim around in the mustard as well as eat their patties with mustard. Among them stands a mummy, who is unimpressed.],
,Mummy:, What, no relish?

"SpongeBob:, It's time to grow myself large and wide.
,[He grows himself large and wide as he is saying it. Walks over to his weight, which is a pink bunny and a blue bear and has trouble lifting it, but manages to get it over his head anyway. The doorbell rings and SpongeBob opens door],
,Sandy:, Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
,SpongeBob:, Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out. ,[shows off his muscles, but is still a weakling],
,Sandy:, Well, you're smelly.
,SpongeBob:, All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. ,[shows all sorts of stuffed animals],
,Sandy:, Uhh... I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob, but you won't see any progress with those.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, really?
,Sandy:, That is, if you want arms like these. ,[rolls up right sleeve, and flexes her right arm, showing off a big, impressive bicep], Or these! ,[rolls up other sleeve and flexes left arm, revealing her other bicep], Or these! ,[shows off her powerful back muscles while executing a back double bicep flex. SpongeBob's arm wiggles in the air],
,SpongeBob:, Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
,Sandy:, Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy! I can see me now. ,[imagines himself with muscles and very tall working at the Krusty Krab, singing and jellyfishing at Jellyfish Fields & telling Gary goodnight, too big for his bed], Yeah... that would change everything!
,Sandy:, Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet. ,[puts a fish bowl on his head. Now the scene cuts to Sandy's tree dome, where SpongeBob is trying to do push-ups], Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! ,[SpongeBob is grunting at this point determined to get a push-up. His body cracks and falls down while his arms stay up],
,SpongeBob:, One. ,[acorn bell dings],
,Sandy:, ,[in boxing ring with gloves on], Alright, put 'em up!
,SpongeBob:, ,[struggles getting his gloves up], They're up.
,Sandy:, Ding ding! ,[punches SpongeBob out of the ring. Later, Sandy starts up her exercise wheel with SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob pants while the wheel goes faster and makes him trip all over the wheel], Feeling the burn?
,SpongeBob:, I'm-fee-ling-some-thing! ,[launches out of the wheel and into the tree dome glass],
,Sandy:, Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
,SpongeBob:, Arm-cruncher, great. ,[looks over and sees two cement blocks slamming into the cement pedestal], This squirrel's trying to kill me!
,Sandy:, ,[walks up to the arm-cruncher with phone in hand], This is it.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. ,[hangs up], This working-out thing isn't working out. ,[arms bulge in and out], Ow. Ow. Ow.
,TV:, Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! ""Oh, I'm a little peanut worm."" Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,TV:, With Anchor arms! ,[puts a long pink blow-up item on his arm], They slip on like a glove. Just add air. ,[puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it], How big do you want 'em? ,[pumps air into other arm], Normal? ,[puts more air into arm], Veiny? And for the ladies... ,[puts air into arm which makes it grow hair], ...hairy. ,[SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark], I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk and everybody loves me. So order now, wimp!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, now that's a good idea!
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone! ,[later, a big shadow of SpongeBob is walking down the road past Squidward, who is licking a popsicle], Hi, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[Tongue stuck to popsicle while looking up.], SpongeBob?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Next scene is Mr. Krabs sweeping the outside of the Krusty Krab. He looks up.], Huh?
,SpongeBob:, Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Mother of pearl! ,[hides in the Krusty Krab. Now, at Mussel Beach where everyone is lifting weights. SpongeBob comes in and makes one guy drop a big weight on two others' feet],
,Fish:, Ow...
,SpongeBob:, Hi, guys. ,[shows off new muscles],
,Larry:, SpongeBob, is that you?
,SpongeBob:, ,[walking on his hands], Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait... ,[flexes those muscles], They're big, aren't they?
,Larry:, Dude, you're ripped!
,SpongeBob:, ,[flexes out the words], Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. ,[flexes more], Yeah. Anyone up for the... ,[flexes muscles into drinks], ...juice bar? (bubble transition to juice bar)
,Scooter:, I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
,Sandy:, Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
,Scooter:, You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there! ,[points to inside of bar],
,Sandy:, Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
,SpongeBob:, ,[now inside],I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
,Sandy:, Pardon me.
,SpongeBob:, Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there. ,[points to weak fish],
,Fish:, Who me? ,[everyone laughs],
,SpongeBob:, I remember when I used to look like you, too. ,[points to Larry and laughs], But, that was a long time ago.
,Bartender:, Here's your drink, sir.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you. ,[tries to lift up drink but can't so he stretches his mouth out to the straw and drinks], Yeah...
,Sandy:, SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
,SpongeBob:, I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. ,[anchor arm almost slips off], Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
,Sandy:, Heck, what's your secret?
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Sandy:, Your secret workout. What is it? ,[everyone wants to know and looks over at SpongeBob. SpongeBob thinks of something nervously and quickly.],
,SpongeBob:, Hmmm, well... I, uhh... first I take my hand and I do this... ,[makes armpit noises],
,Larry:, Are you kidding?
,SpongeBob:, Do these muscles lie? ,[flexes muscles into a shape of a sponge. Everyone starts making armpit noises],
,Sandy:, I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
,Sandy:, Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, what do you mean?
,Sandy:, The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
,Bartender:, Here's your drink. ,[sets drink on SpongeBob's anchor-arm hand and it sinks down],
,Sandy:, Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!

,Sandy:, C'mon, let's go.
,SpongeBob:, Right now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... ,[tries to run away but the drink is holding him back. Tries lifting the drink but is unsuccessful], Sandy, wait!
,Sandy:, Here it is-- the sign-in list.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no.
,Sandy:, ,[signs her name on a piece of paper], Okay, Sandy Cheeks. ,[puts the paper into entry box],
,SpongeBob:, ,[still struggling], Wait, Sandy-- don't sign just yet!
,Sandy:, ,[Puts the paper in the box],
,SpongeBob:, Wait!
,Sandy:, Okay...
,SpongeBob:, ,[struggles even harder], Wait!
,Sandy:, ,[signs names], SpongeBob SquarePants. ,[the bartender lifts the drink off of SpongeBob, which sends him flying towards Sandy],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, wait...! ,[slams into pole],
,Sandy:, It's okay, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. ,[at the competition],
,Announcer:, We on? Welcome to the Goo Lagoon 8th annual anchor toss competition. ,[everyone is getting ready but SpongeBob is nervous],
,Sandy:, Ready, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. ,[blows frantically into his Anchor Arms],
,Announcer:, Could I get some mustard on that? Oh. First up, Don the Whale. ,[Don throws the anchor and it lands. Fish comes up to measure distance],
,Measurer:, 200 yards. ,[crowd cheers],
,Announcer:, Let's see an instant-replay. ,[another anchor comes flying in on top of the measurer and hits him.], Amazing! Up next, Larry the Lobster. ,[Larry throws his anchor and it follows the measurer wherever he goes],
,Measurer:, 210 yards!
,Announcer:, Here goes, Sandy Cheeks. ,[Sandy throws it up in the air and kicks it away. Measurer runs around until he gets hit],
,Measurer:, 510 yards!
,Announcer:, Wow! Fabulous!
,Sandy:, Beat that, SpongeBob!
,Announcer:, Up next, SpongeBob SquarePants.
,Crowd:, ,[crowd is imitating the armpit exercise while others are holding up SpongeBob signs and chanting], SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[tries to pull the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs], Just kidding. Just kidding. ,[everyone laughs],
,Sandy:, That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp, I'm a jerk!
,[He blows his Anchor Arms over the ""JERK"" size. Tries to lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again, but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd 'ooh's. Tries to lift again and causes the air to go into his left tooth. Tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body, then explode. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflate, floating down. SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body.],
,Crowd Attendee:, I think he lost. ,[crowd chants for Sandy], Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! ,[Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot, disappointed. SpongeBob walks away, leaving his destroyed Anchor Arms on the ground and follows Sandy to the Treedome],
,SpongeBob:, 96. 97. 98. 99. 100.
,Sandy:, I want 100 more.
,SpongeBob:, It hurts. ,[changes channel over and over], 1. 2. 3. 4...
,Sandy:, I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.

"[At Mrs. Puff's Boating School],
,Mr. Fitz:, Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating School Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusual large number of failings from this classroom.
,Mrs. Puff:, That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.
,Mr. Fitz:, Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times. ,[shows folder with a bunch of files],
,Mrs. Puff:, You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.
,Mr. Fitz:, We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.
,SpongeBob:, Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?
,Mr. Fitz:, Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[in the boat with SpongeBob and Mr. Fitz], Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?
,SpongeBob:, ,[snaps fingers], Seat-belt-aroony. One second. ,[gets tangled in seat-belt then squeezes self through. Mr. Fitz writes on his notepad],
,Mrs. Puff:, Then what do you do?
,SpongeBob:, Start the engine?
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes.
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts the boat], Now what do I do?
,Mrs. Puff:, Drive the boat. ,[SpongeBob drives into a boat],
,SpongeBob:, Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, No, SpongeBob, you failed.
,SpongeBob:, I failed?
,Mr. Fitz:, It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's ,Mrs. Puff, that's failed ,you., You are relieved of your teaching duties.
,Mrs. Puff:, I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore? ,[starts laughing louder and louder], No more... SpongeBob?! I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. ""[Flies away]"" Free at last! Free at last!
,SpongeBob:, ,[in classroom], I got Mrs. Puff fired. ,[banging and crashing],
,Roderick:, Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor. ,[he smashes Mrs. Puff's nameplate], No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.
,Nat:, Does that mean... ,[Roderick throws Nat through the door],
,Roderick:, Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon.
,Monroe:, Uhh, I'll eat one. ,[all gasp. Monroe walks to Roderick],
,Roderick:, Pick your favorite. ,[Monroe takes one and eats it], How's it taste?
,Monroe:, It's a delightful taste sensation.
,Roderick:, No eating in my classroom! ,[throws Monroe through another door], Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class... ,[everyone but SpongeBob run out], Looks like you're the man, Sponge.
,SpongeBob:, I am?

,SpongeBob:, Ready for my test, sir.
,Roderick:, ,[takes SpongeBob out of the boat], You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first. ,[shows roads will all sorts of obstacles], This is ,[the], most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.
,SpongeBob:, Crawl?
,Roderick:, Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. ,[SpongeBob crawls forward],
,SpongeBob:, Left turn. ,[turns left], Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!
,Roderick:, Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.

,Roderick:, I'm ashamed of you, cadet. ,[removes the pebble from SpongeBob's hand], Tripped up by a wee pebble. ,[crushes the pebble], What are you suppose to be learning in my class?
,SpongeBob:, How to drive, sir?
,Roderick:, Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. Then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl. ,[bends SpongeBob's arm], I want you to crawl! ,[puts SpongeBob's arm back],
,SpongeBob:, Sir, yes, sir!
,Roderick:, Now get out there! ,[SpongeBob crawls around a hole then his instructor takes off his shoes and socks; he wiggles his toes after his shoes are forcibly taken off, and carries the instructor on his back. Then he stops at a stop sign, and runs in and out of some radioactive waste], Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out. ,[hands SpongeBob a wrench], Here, go take that boat apart. ,[SpongeBob takes the boat apart], I'm impressed, son.

,Roderick:, Jumpin' jellyfish... ,[the rocket blasts off],
,SpongeBob:, Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians! ,[crashes through a lot of pedestrians], So, umm, how'd I do?
,Roderick:, How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... HOW YOU DID!
,SpongeBob:, Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?
,Roderick:, Not quite. ,[puts blindfold on SpongeBob], Now do it blindfolded.
,Narrator:, Several days later...

,Roderick:, Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead. ,[SpongeBob parallel parks], Very good. ,[now at real exam], Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts. ,[puts on seatbelt with no problem],
,Roderick:, Excellent work, cadet. What's next?
,SpongeBob:, Step 2 would be... ignite engine.
,Roderick:, Step 3?
,SpongeBob:, Step 3 would be... ,[takes out blindfold and his eyes shrink], ...engage blindfold.
,Roderick:, What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.
,SpongeBob:, But I can't do it without a blindfold.
,Roderick:, Drive, boy! Drive!
,[SpongeBob kicks down on the gas pedal and the boat is off. At the first turn is a giant red canister labeled ""GAS"". SpongeBob fails to make the right turn and instead crashes right into the gas can, obliterating the boating school faculty in a mushroom-radius explosion, and sending debris from the boating school sign, etc., flying everywhere. As the debris begins to clear, the boat flies into the air and goes soaring.],
,Roderick:, Mayday! Mayday! You're off course. ,[boat drives into 2 buildings then underground. Spurts out from a fire hydrant. Then crashes through a bakery and into a field where Mrs. Puff is painting the scenery],
,Mrs. Puff:, Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob. ,[Mrs. Puff notices the boat and attempts to paint something really quick. When boat runs into her, the painting shows SpongeBob, the instructor, and Mr. Fitz fearing their lives],
,Roderick:, The brake son!
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, sir. ,[takes brake apart], There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts.
,Roderick:, I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her. ,[jumps in front of the boat in an attempt to stop it], Come get some! ,[boat runs over him],
,SpongeBob:, Man down. Man down. ,[SpongeBob drives into the city and into each building], Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now. ,[boat drives out of the now destroyed city, and then cuts to SpongeBob driving while wearing Patrick's pants over his eyes], I can't see! I can't see!
,Patrick:, My pants!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I can't see! ,[dodges traffic and pedestrians as Mrs. Puff screams. Parallel parks], Did I pass?
,Mr. Fitz:, Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have.
,Patrick:, ,[takes pants off SpongeBob's head], The nerve of some people.
,Mr. Fitz:, Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.
,SpongeBob:, ,[at boating school], Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm ""unteachable"".
,Mrs. Puff:, It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back. ,[sniffles, holds up a burnt, charred object], And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion, ,[voice breaking], so it's as if you never failed.
,SpongeBob:, I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff. ,[shows name tag], I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.

,Squidward:, ,[Laying on a chair], And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!
,Patrick:, ,[Appears behind Squidward], Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
,SpongeBob:, Ow!
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you hear something?
,Pearl:, Just the sound of this vacation dying!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Raises arm], Um, is time to come up yet?
,Pearl:, Sure, why not? Join the funeral. Super Mega Mall World? Is that where we going?
,Mr. Krabs:, Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better! ,[Drives past Super Mega Mall World],
,SpongeBob:, Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?
,Mr. Krabs:, But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Laughs], The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!
,SpongeBob:, Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Laughs], Bathroom Land! Oh SpongeBob! You kill me!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Continues driving], Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Closes eyes and crosses legs], Bathroom! Bathroom!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Stops driving], Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!
,Mr. Krabs: , Oh... that's okay, honey. We weren't going there anyway. THAT'S where we're going!
,Pearl:, Gasp!
,Mr. Krabs:, It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?
,Pearl:, There is NO way I'm going in there! I rather sit in through the rubble of the Teenage Boy Museum! ,[goes over to what is left of the Teenage Boy Museum],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint! ,[Hearts in eyes fly off],
,[Bubble transition to inside the Bikini Bottom Mint],
,Mr. Krabs:, Is this the most exciting day in you life?
,SpongeBob:, Not really.
,Bill:, Thank you all for coming to the Bikini Bottom Mint. My name is Bill. ,[Points to his name tag],
,SpongeBob:, Bill? ,[Laughs],
,Bill,: And yes... I am aware of the hilarious irony between my name and my job. Now, I'll be your tour guide for today. This tour will take you through the entire money process.
,Mr. Krabs:, You hear that, boy? ,[Eyes in SpongeBob's face], The entire money making... process!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I... ,[Takes Mr. Krabs' eyes off his face], ...sure did sir!
,Bill:, ,[Leading the crowd], This just to your right is the first part of the dollar making process. ,[Shows the crowd people behind the glass window operating a pressing machine], Where very special sheets of paper are prepped for...
,Mr. Krabs:, Guah guah guah guah guah! ,[Starts licking the glass window],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is starting at us. ,[Shakes Mr. Krabs], Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!
,Mr. Krabs:, Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich!
,Bill: ,Ahem...
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! ,[Dusts off SpongeBob], Uh... uh...
,Bill:, ,[Walks the crowd to a new area], And in this area here to my left, we see the process in which the sheets of silver are pressed into... ,[The machine then pounds the silver sheet into coins], ...shiny blank coins which are collected in back of one million pieces for the coining press.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of... ,[His eyes start to inflate], silver coins? ,[His eyes explode with the pieces flying],
,Bill: , They call... ,[Gets hit in the face by pieces of Mr. Krabs' eyes and the rest hit the other tourists],
,SpongeBob:, Uh oh! I thought this might happen! ,[Takes out a box that says ""Replacement Eyes"" and screws the eyes into Mr. Krabs and turns him on],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us! ,[Points to Bill and the others moving forward],
,Bill: , ,[Talking with the tourists],
,SpongeBob:, We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs? ,[Notices Mr. Krabs is gone and looks over], Gasp! ,[Sees Mr. Krabs on the conveyor belt getting ready to be crushed by the machine], MR. KRABS!
,Mr. Krabs:, He he he he!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Pushes Mr. Krabs out of the way but gets crushed instead turning into many coins], I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change! ,[Laughs], Good one, huh, Mr. Krabs? AHHH! ,[Reforms back together], Watch out, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Holding a coin and moving down the conveyor belt], Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours? ,[A machine with a needle makes the face on one coin and moves up towards it], Do you believe in love at first sight?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Swings by and saves Mr. Krabs], Phew... that was close.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!
,Bill:, Now this machine here is where we destroy old money by means of shredding.
,Mr. Krabs:, Pretty neat, huh, boy? That's where they... ,[Claw pops and his whole arm deflates], ...DESTROY MONEY!?!? NOOO! ,[Charges to the shredder looking at the shredded money], NOOO! WHY? WHY? ,[Starts crying a fountain],
,SpongeBob: , ,[Puts buckets on both sides of Mr. Krabs], It's okay, sir. I'm sure I...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Arms and nose pop off as he continues to cry from all ends, starting to flood the Mint],
,SpongeBob:, Wah oh! ,[Feet turn into propellers and he swims toward Mr. Krabs turning a knob on him which stops him from crying then sucks up all of the tears and tries to spit them out the window but goes through the wall instead.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Finishes spitting],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Rocking on the ground speaking gibberish],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! It's okay! ,[Picks up Mr. Krabs], The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See? ,[Shows Mr. Krabs the new dollars being made],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's a miracle!
,SpongeBob:, Yay!
,Bill:, ,[Angry], That is it! I have had enough of your nonsense! GUARDS! Show these two good-for-nothing toddlers out! Right no- Oh my... ,[Notices the guards tied up and two robbers stealing the money. His fin deflates and then hides behind the crowd], Angry, thieving criminals aren't part of this tour. Take whatever you want!
,Skinny Robber:, Take care of them!
,Muscular Robber:, No problem, boss! ,[Growls and moves toward the crowd],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Jumps in], Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler! ,[Throws SpongeBob at the Muscular Robber, which has no effect],
,SpongeBob:, That didn't work at all! ,[Falls to the ground],
,Muscular Robber:, Grrrr...
,Mr. Krabs:, Grrrr... YAHHH! ,[Charges at the Muscular Robber and knocks him into the Skinny Robber. Uses SpongeBob to tie them up, then tosses them through the ceiling and into a police car],
,Policeman:, That was easy...
,Policewoman:, Yep, sure was...
,Mr. Krabs:, Good work, boy!
,SpongeBob:, You, too, sir!
,Bill:, ,[He along with the crowd claps for SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs], Clearly, I misjudged you. You are both brave citizens and for that, on behalf of the Mint, I would like to present you both ,[Takes out two dollars], brand new, extremely fine, limited edition, limited brand dollar bills with your faces on them.
,SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs:, Oooooo...
,Bill:, ,[Gives them their dollars],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! It's-
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Takes it], Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation!
,Pearl:, ,[takes both of them], And I haven't charged YOU yet for taking me on this terrible vacation! ,[turns to a lady holding a box], Here's the two dollars I was short on those shoes. I must've maxed out daddy's credit card! ,[laughs and takes the box full of shoes], Yay! Shoes!
,Mr. Krabs: , ,[Starts to cry], Shoes?

,Bubble Bass:, And we're back. My first guest had dinner with me just last night. He's a close personal friend of mine. Please welcome the Krabby Patty. ,[audience clap], Great to have you back on the program.
,Krabby Patty:, Great to be here, BB.
,Bubble Bass:, Well, I'm sorry to say it, but last night, you were not quite as delicious as one would hope.
,Krabby Patty:, Oh don't worry, I'm sure Mr. Krabs will give you a refund. ,[percussion sting] [laughter],

,Mama Bass:, Moving? Hah! You can't even do your own laundry! ,[grunts],
,Bubble Bass:, ,[underwear lands on Bubble Bass's face, and a fly is heard buzzing. SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing in the background], All I need to do is find two able-bodied idiots. But where am I to find such stupidity on such short notice? Hm... ,[wagoon crashes into Bubble Bass],
,SpongeBob:, Whoops. ,[Bubble Bass grunts], Sorry, Bubble Bass.
,Bubble Bass:, Why you two able-bodied idiots! I—  ,[gasps], Ooh. ,[Patrick sobbers and SpongeBob blinks strangely], Why, SpongeBob and Patrick, my occasional friends. How would you two like to earn a free lunch?
,Patrick:, Freeeeeee lunch! ,[His head turns as if a balloon and then explodes]',
,Bubble Bass:,  All righty, we're moving all of my belongings out of my mother's basement into my grandmother's basement across town. Let's start with my lounge.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat. ,[grunts],
,Bubble Bass:, ,[fakes having his back popped by breaking a stick], Ow! My bad back! I guess you two will have to move everything without me. So I'll meet you both at this address.
,SpongeBob:, But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
,Bubble Bass:, Ooh, ahh, I guess you'll have to pack my stuff too. But remember with gastric prizes await your mouths.

,SpongeBob:, That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.
,Patrick:, I would.
,SpongeBob:, Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.

,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots. ,[SpongeBob sits down, but the boots are in his way, so he can't see Mr. Krabs], So you want to get paid?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots ,[leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other], are in ,[leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other], the way.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pushes the boots aside], In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
,SpongeBob:, Who's that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.

,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!
,[SpongeBob bounces up and down in the boots, making them squeak, as Squidward watches. Then SpongeBob bounces harder until Squidward's head is bouncing up and down really hard trying to keep up. Then SpongeBob leaves to squeak his boots around the Krusty Krab.],
,Squidward:, That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[muttering], Money, money, money, money, money. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty... ,[all of a sudden, the pair of squeaky boots jumps into the register. He opens his eyes], Wha? Who's there? ,[rests his head on his pillow], Back to countin' me money. ,[closes his eyes again and imagines coins jumping into the register], One, two, three, four, five... ,[the boots appear again; Mr. Krabs opens his eyes again], What the barnacle is that? ,[he sees that the bedroom window is opening and shutting by itself, making squeaky noises. Mr. Krabs closes the window and gets back into bed, but notices the window has opened again. He walks back across the room to close it but steps into a hole and falls out the window, breaking the tip of his leg off in the process. He gets back into his bedroom, watches his step to avoid another hole and shuts the window, but it won't close. He starts shutting it with increasing force and speed until the window finally stays closed. The window reopens again, and Mr. Krabs gives it the ""evil eye"" followed by a growl. The window immediately closes back, as if it says ""Yipe!"" Mr. Krabs then starts to go back to bed, but he steps into the same hole he avoided earlier and breaks the tip of his other leg off. He screams as he gets flung into his hammock and gets all twisted up in it. Mr. Krabs can do nothing but lie there with bloodshot eyes as the window makes squeaky noises all night, as if it is clapping at him.

At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work. ,[As he walks up to the door, Squidward slams the doors open into Mr. Krabs' face],

,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob. ,[every time SpongeBob's boots squeak, Mr. Krabs stutters. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, but he is so tall, all Mr. Krabs can see is his boots],
,Mr. Krabs:, I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
,SpongeBob:, Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? ,[runs in place fast with plates of Krabby Patties in each hand],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
,SpongeBob:, Or could he do this? ,[leans over to one table and sets the plate on the table without having to move from his spot at all], Or this? ,[leans to another table and puts a plate of patties on that table, then goes behind the register on top of the boat], And watch this, Mr. Krabs! ,[moves his boots around slightly, making them ""talk""],
,Squeaky Boots:, May I take your order?
,Francis:, Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special.
,Squeaky Boots:, Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it's ready.
,SpongeBob:, Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I, uhh...
,SpongeBob:, And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. ,[does many different things with his boots until Mr. Krabs can't take it anymore],

,SpongeBob:, Good night, Gary.
,[as SpongeBob is sleeping with his boots on, Mr. Krabs peeks over his diving board and climbs down, then takes his boots off and runs to the Krusty Krab, laughing quietly. Some hammering sounds are heard, then a rooster crows as night fades to morning],

,Mr. Krabs:, What is it, my boy?

Even the dripping kitchen sink makes squeaking sounds instead of dripping sounds. Eventually he starts seeing visions of SpongeBob and his boots.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in Mr. Krabs' head] Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this... [Mr. Krabs' eye starts swirling],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[snaps], Stop it! ,[the customers look at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy], ,Stop... it!, ,[his eyes start contorting], Oh, oh, don't you hear it?! Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards! ,[sobbing], Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots! ,[throws himself onto the floor and bawls], I'm sorry! But I can't take the infernal squeakin' no more! ,[lifts up the Krusty Krab and grabs the boots, with everyone screaming inside. He then walks into the kitchen with an evil expression on his face and puts the boots into a vat of grease, which shrinks them, and he eats them. After that, he opens the door to the dining room, and lets out a long burp], The deed is done.
,SpongeBob:, Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
,SpongeBob:, You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I do, son. ,[hands SpongeBob a stack of money], Here's the paycheck I owe you. ,[puts another stack of money on top of the first stack], Plus a bonus! ,[takes the bonus back], Well, there's your paycheck anyway. ,[walks away], I need a vacation.
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Mr. Krabs!
,[fade to Mr. Krabs and Pearl taking a drive out to somewhere, with a camper behind their boat],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
,Pearl:, ,[lifts her feet over the side of the door to reveal her new shoes], Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
,Mr. Krabs:, Darling, I won't. ,[as he laughs, he hiccups and the squeaky noise comes out], Oh, no. ,[continues to hiccup and squeak as they drive off into the distance],

"[The scene begins with a boat driving up to the intersection between the Chum Bucket and the Krusty Krab. A bureaucrat fish steps out of the car and places a stake into the street. He then places two signs on both of the hangers.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[inside Krusty Krab], Hmm. What could be the doings of this stranger?
,Plankton:, ,[inside Chum Bucket], This looks suspicious.
,Mr. Krabs and Plankton:, ,[both Mr. Krabs and Plankton step out of their restaurants toward the male fish], What's the big idea?
,Bureaucrat Fish:, Mr. Eugene Krabs and Sheldon Plankton?
,Plankton and Mr. Krabs:, Yes?
,Bureaucrat Fish:, These are for you. ,[walks away. They both look at the two signs],
,Plankton and Mr. Krabs:, ,[reading the signs], ""Updated city ordinance: Fast Food Restaurants cannot be within 100 feet of each other"". Huh?
,Bureaucrat Fish:, The Krusty Krab and The Chum Bucket are located too close together. One of your restaurants is going to have to be bulldozed. 
,Plankton and Mr. Krabs:, ,[in shock], B - B - B - Bulldozed!? ,[They measure the distance between the 2 restaurants with Tape Measures],
,Plankton:, ,[in shock], 99 feet!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sad], It's true!
,Plankton:, ,[letting go of the tape measure], Ah! ,[crashes into pole], Oof!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[suspicious], Which one of us is gonna get bulldozed?
,Bureaucrat Fish:, That's for you two to decide.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[angry], I'm not going anywhere!. You're the one who is moving!
,Plankton:, ,[angry], You are moving!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ohoho! No, you are!
,Plankton:, Oh, no I'm not!
,Bureaucrat Fish:, ,[interrupts them], Gentlemen, you have 24 hours to decide which of you moves. That's the law around here! ,[He drives off],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[angry], Pack your bags pipsqueak!
,Plankton:, ,[angry], You might as well close up shop right now, Krabs. Your customers won't miss a thing.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], At least I have customers.
,Plankton:, ,[angry], Oh yeah!? Well I'm gonna put together a... uh... a petition of customer signatures.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha! Good luck with that ludicrous idea! ,[walks to Krusty Krab],. ,[confused], Petition? ,[Walks through doors], Squidward! SpongeBob!
,[Squidward puts magazine down], ,[SpongeBob zooms to Mr. Krabs while Squidward walks],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hands petitions to SpongeBob and Squidward], You two take these petitions to save The Krusty Krab and secure as many signatures as you can!
,SpongeBob:, ,[saluting], Sir, yes, sir!
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastic], Oh yeah, I'm definitely gonna do this.
,SpongeBob:, ,[signing], And I'm gonna be the first signature. There and how about you Squidward? Could we count on your support? ,[in shock to see Squidward gone and the petition still there], Squidward?
,[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puffs Boating School],
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Mrs. Puff!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[frightened], No! Stay away! I can't afford to go back in the slammer!
,SpongeBob:, I'm just here if you would sign this petition. It'll save the Krusty Krab from getting bulldozed!
,Mrs. Puff:, Why would I care about that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mrs. Puff, don't you care what happens to Mr. Krabs? Squidward? Gary? Me?
,Mrs. Puff:, Not particularly.
,Delivery Man:, ,[walks in the classroom], Excuse me? I'm looking for a Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes, that's me.
,Delivery Man:, Your new boat's here. Just sign here, please. ,[Mrs. Puff signs the paper],
,SpongeBob:, Speaking of signatures, would you sign this petition to save the Krusty Krab? ,[SpongeBob hands out a piece of paper],
,Delivery Man:, Why would I care about the Krusty Krab? ,[annoyed], I'll unload the boat. ,[SpongeBob and the delivery man both walk out of the classroom. SpongeBob notices something about the boat.], ,[closeup of the boat's lever],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mr. Delivery Man. I got this. ,[SpongeBob pushes down the boat's lever. It moves backwards, heading straight towards the school. Mrs. Puff notices this.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Noo! ,[She closes the door, when the boat crashes into the school. Mrs. Puff puffs up.],
,[bubble transition to SpongeBob walking on the street],
,SpongeBob:, ,[He comes to a repair man close to a boat, who looks at a piece of paper], Excuse me, sir. Would you like to sign a petition to save the Krusty Krab?
,Repair Man:, ,[confused], Why would I want to do that? The food there is dangerous. ,[closeup of the paper that says, ""Krabby Patties are Dangerous"" as SpongeBob reads it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[worried], Sir, where did you get this?
,Repair Man:, It was on my windshield. They're all over the place! ,[even more copies of the paper are attached to buildings],
,SpongeBob:, This must be Plankton's dirty plan. ,[cut to SpongeBob running towards the Krusty Krab], Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! ,[As he enters, many people with papers all talking at once angrily to Mr. Krabs],
,Nat:, Hey, Mr. Krabs! Why are your patties dangerous?
,Everyone:, Yeah! ,[They keep talking at once.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[worried], I...I...uh... My...my patties are dangerous because...because they're so...uh...uh...they're so-
,SpongeBob:, ,[comes out of the kitchen with a plate of Krabby Patties], Delicious!
,Nat:, ,[as everyone else stares], Kid's got a point. ,[Everyone talks at once happily. They start taking the patties.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[leans closer to SpongeBob], Thanks for saving me shell, boy!
,SpongeBob:, Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. Thank the Krabby Patty.
,Plankton:, ,[growls, then returns to the Chum Bucket, sad], That does it!
,Karen:, Throwing in the napkin, are we?
,Plankton:, ,[sobs loudly on a suitcase], My restaurant. My laboratory. My evil inventions. All about to be flattened! Just give me a moment to say my goodbyes. ,[walks sadly by his former things while holding the suitcase], Farewell, stench-vision goggles. Farewell, Chum Bucket replicator. Farewell, hypnotizer helmet. We had some diabolical times together, didn't we? ,[walks to a cannon], So long, sonic cannon that destroys every known material in the universe. ,[As he accidentally sobs on the cannon's button, it activates, and makes a hole, destroying part of the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob sees this while humming on the street. He finally hears Plankton crying, sobbing while laying down.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Plankton, I'm sorry. ,[sniffs], Sorry I made my Krabby Patty so delicious. ,[sobs],
,Plankton:, ,[angry], Hey, get lost! I'm the only one that weeps around here.
,SpongeBob:, But I can't help it think that I somehow had a hand in your misery. Or at least a spatula. Nobody would sign a petition to bulldoze the Krusty Krab unless you pay them. And who would be low enough to do that?
,Plankton:, ,[smiles, closes a door, then chuckles evilly], Karen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
,Karen:, Before you start buying up those petition signatures, you should know that our checking account balance is ,[shown on her screen], negative $375.
,Plankton:, Not to worry, my lady. I have a plan.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cut to him looking through a telescope], Hmm... Now there's something you don't see every day.
,SpongeBob:, ,[serves Krabby Patties to a three-headed fish], Three-Headed Jake? He comes in every day.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not him. I'm referring to the large crowd gathered at the Chum Bucket. It appears they are actually giving Plankton... money?! ,[A customer gives Plankton money while wearing the hypnotizer helmet from earlier.],
,Plankton:, You just got a steal, sir. You'll get many villainous years out of that little number. ,[He chuckles evilly, then jumps up to put the money in the cash register.], I'll forget this restaurant nonsense, Karen. I should've opened a yard sale business years ago. ,[Fish look at stuff.], Step up, fishes. Every evil invention is price to move!
,Charlie:, I'll take this riptide generator off your hands! ,[gives Plankton money],
,Nat:, ,[He wears the goggles from earlier.], I'll give you $1,000 for the stench-vision goggles. ,[puts the money on Plankton's antennas],
,Pilar:, ,[points at Karen], Hey, how much for the computer?
,Plankton:, How much you got?
,Karen:, ,[angry], Plankton!
,Plankton:, All right. My wife's not for sale. ,[to everyone], But everything else must go! ,[Everyone cheers and gives Plankton even more money, smiling. Plankton sticks his head out of the stack.], Well, wifey. Looks like it's time to proceed to the next phase. ,[As he pulls a rope, the sign changes from ""Yard Sale"" to ""$ for your signature"".], ,[through a megaphone, holding a dollar], Who wants free money? ,[Everyone notices.],
,Dennis:, ,[turns his head], Free?!
,Debbie:, ,[also turns her head], Money?! ,[Everyone happily runs to the stand.],
,Nat:, Free money! ,[Angrily, he turns a boat to the other side then joins everyone else. The boat catches on fire and explodes.],
,Plankton:, ,[Everyone crowds around him.], Okay, okay. One at a time, please. ,[holding a dollar], To receive your free money, ,[holding a piece of paper attached to a clipboard], just sign this petition to save the Chum Bucket.
,Pilar:, Ooh, ooh. Me first. ,[As he signs the petition, Plankton gives him a dollar, then laughs evilly.], Yeah!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[He walks in the Krusty Krab, angry.], This is outrageous! ,[to SpongeBob], You see what Plankton's doing, don't ya? He's undermining the democratic process by lab raging his temporarily financial windfall in order to buy every signature in Bikini Bottom. ,[counts his change], There's 20, 40, 50... We just bought mine 4 times! And me tasty food is one thing. ,[points out the window], But how can I compete with free money? ,[sad], I'm doomed! Well... clean around, boy. Border up. I'm afraid we're closing up for good. ,[sobs while biting his finger],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sad], Mr. Krabs is hurt so much!
,Squidward:, ,[laughs hysterically], Whoo... priceless.
,Plankton:, ,[meanwhile, as everyone cheers...], ,[happily], Thank you, thank you! I've got what I need! ,[holding up the clipboard and paper], I got the signatures! ,[confused while looking at the paper], All but one. Guess I won't be hiring the yellow sponge anytime soon. ,[evilly happily], But none of that matters now! Cause the majority is on my side! Which in a democracy is all you need.
,[Meanwhile, cut to SpongeBob putting mayonnaise in a box, then taping it up, then cut to Mr. Krabs putting down a clock as the truck from the beginning of the episode arrives.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sad], It's time. ,[He goes outside on the street and waits for the truck to stop in front of him.],
,Bureaucrat Fish:, ,[puts one of the truck's windows down], So, who's getting bulldozed today?
,Plankton:, ,[with the clipboard], Oh, not me, your bureaucraticness. I completed my petition. ,[Mr. Krabs is worried.],
,Bureaucrat Fish:, The people have spoken. Step aside, Mr. Krabs. ,[Part of the truck smokes fire out.],
,Mr. Krabs:, But... but... ,[As he backs up, the truck follows him, towards the Krusty Krab.], ,[angry], No! I'm not going anywhere!
,Bureaucrat Fish:, Please comply, Mr. Krabs. It'll be quick and painless.
,Mr. Krabs:, If you wanna bulldoze me restaurant, ,[locks himself up], it's gonna be long and painful!
,SpongeBob:, ,[is seen at the top of the restaurant, also locked up], ,[angry], Stand your ground, Mr. Krabs! We are right behind you, right, Squidward? ,[The lock is empty.], Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[He is outside his home, with an umbrella on top of him, sitting on a chair, and drinking a cup of tea, happily.],
,Bureaucrat Fish:, ,[He moves his truck closer to the restaurant.], Okay, now this is really your last chance.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[still angry], I'm never leaving the Krusty Krab!
,Bureaucrat Fish:, Fine. Have it your way. ,[He pushes a lever.],
,Plankton:, ,[He chuckles evilly, while setting up himself a movie theater seat, then sits on it.], Bring it on! Bring the destruction! ,[munches on popcorn],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Part of the truck smokes more fire out, and the truck starts to move even closer to the restaurant.], ,[sad], Goodbye, Krusty Krab! ,[As he closes his eyes, the truck begins to move the restaurant, but only moves 1 foot.], ,[confused], Eh?
,Bureaucrat Fish:, Thank you for your cooperation.
,Plankton:, ,[spits the popcorn out, angry], What?! Excuse me, sir, but, uh... ,[stands on the seat], you forgot to level the place!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[confused], Uhh... yeah.
,Bureaucrat Fish:, Demolition is outside of my purview. I simply ensure that restaurants comply with the 100 foot ordinance. ,[He measures the distance with a tape measure and says the 1 foot on it.], That's 1 more foot. Perfect! ,[He walks away from the restaurant.],
,Plankton:, ,[jumping on the seat, still angry], But that's not fair! ,[He slips inside and the seat closes on him,.]
,SpongeBob:, So you're not gonna destroy the Krusty Krab?
,Bureaucrat Fish:, No...
,SpongeBob:, ,[He jumps inside the truck, hugging the bureaucrat fish.], Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! ,[As the bureaucrat fish accidentally pulls the lever, the truck goes backwards. He and SpongeBob look out the window.], Oh, dear. ,[The truck crashes through the Chum Bucket, destroying it.],
,Plankton:, ,[Meanwhile, he's free from the seat after struggling to.], ,[still angry], Come on! Let's do this! I wanna see some destruction! ,[As he gasps, he finally sees the destroyed Chum Bucket.], I think I've seen enough. ,[He goes back inside the seat],

"[A shadow that looks like Plankton walks up to the Krusty Krab and gets inside using the code. He goes back into Mr. Krabs' office and opens up the safe and gets out the formula. SpongeBob turns on the lights to reveal the shadow is Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, What are you doing, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe. ,[he points to a calendar], Plankton hasn't tried stealing the formula in over a month. He must be planning something big.
,Squidward:, ,[walks in], Hello.
,Mr. Krabs:, One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work.
,Squidward:, ,[walks out], Goodbye.
,Mr. Krabs:, I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton.

,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm going to be a spy.

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[back inside], Shh! Okay, okay! You can be a spy. Just be quiet.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Hooray, we're spy buddies! ,[Mr. Krabs stammers. SpongeBob & Patrick whisper], Spy buddies.
,Mr. Krabs:, Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty. But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, In my hands. ,[he looks at his hands], Ooh!
,Patrick:, ,[he grabs SpongeBob's hand and looks at it], Ooh. ,[cut to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob pushes the button on the patty],
,Mr. Krabs:, Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to discover what Plankton's up to. Don't let him out of your sight. You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets. If you don't accept it, you're fired! This patty will self-destruct in 10 seconds. ,[both scream and run around while the patty is beeping],
,SpongeBob:, Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick! ,[Patrick puts the patty in his pants. They both cover their ears. The patty explodes and leaves the bottom half of Patrick's body without any skin. The walls in SpongeBob's pineapple get fried, and they turn into a greenish color],

,SpongeBob:, Hey, Sandy.
,Sandy:, Hey, SpongeBob, Patrick. What y'all doing?
,SpongeBob:, Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?
,Sandy:, Well, I know you need a lot of crazy gadgets like jet-packs and laser-equipped Bermuda shorts with walkie-talkies.
,Man on Walkie Talkie:, 10-4, good buddy. ,[static],
,Sandy:, Cameras that fit up your nose, high-powered magnifying glasses, and my favorite, the knockout ray. ,[blasts SpongeBob and Patrick with it causes them to knockout. Then blasts them again making them wake up],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies.
,Sandy:, ,[laughs], I wouldn't trust you two with any of this stuff.
,SpongeBob:, What do we do now, Patrick? ,[Patrick picks up the knockout ray and knocks Sandy out. Both laugh. Cut to the city where SpongeBob and Patrick are spying from the side of a building],
,Patrick:, What's he doing now?
,SpongeBob:, Nothing yet. Wait! Wait! He's... ,[Plankton walks into ""Guppies R Us""], ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer.
,Plankton:, Excuse me? ,[holds up a small pink outfit], Do you have anything in a size negative five?
,Employee:, ,[laughs], Sorry, bud, that's as small as they come. ,[He takes the outfit. Plankton sighs and walks away. SpongeBob enlarges himself in the clothes on the wall],

,Patrick:, How embarrassing. ,[Plankton walks out of ""Guppies R Us"". SpongeBob walks out a couple seconds later],
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Krabs here. Go ahead.
,SpongeBob:, Plankton just bought some baby clothes.
,Mr. Krabs:, Baby clothes? Hmm... ,[writes 'baby clothes' on the chalkboard], What's he doing now?
,SpongeBob:, Hold on. ,[looks through store window], He's buying...
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah? Yeah?
,SpongeBob:, A... stamp.
,Mr. Krabs:, A stamp. ,[writes 'stamp' on the chalkboard], This is the most elaborate scheme ever. Keep on him, SpongeBob. ,[cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are tip-toeing behind Plankton],
,SpongeBob:, We're right behind him, and he has no idea! ,[from Plankton's POV, the tip-toes are thunderous steps. He turns around],
,Plankton:, Would you stop making all that racket? ,[from SpongeBob and Patrick's POV, Plankton is squeaking as he talks so they can't understand him],

,SpongeBob:, I can't tell. ,[they walk again but SpongeBob is shining a light on Plankton from the magnifying glass],
,Plankton:, Whew! Gosh, it's hot. ,[catches on fire], Ahhhh!
,SpongeBob:, He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-packs!
,Patrick:, Can do! ,[pushes a button and Patrick grabs SpongeBob as they fly toward Plankton. Plankton jumps into a soda drink and puts himself out],
,Plankton:, Whew. Huh? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick fly over Plankton, setting him and the cup on fire, while they fly through buildings. The jet-pack detaches itself from Patrick and they both skid on the sidewalk. When they stand up, their faces and bodies are deformed],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton!
,Patrick:, To the spy mobile! ,[both hop into the car],
,SpongeBob:, Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield...
,Patrick:, Self destruct!! ,[pushes button and the car explodes. Both laugh. Patrick's pants phone is ringing], There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone.
,Mr. Krabs:, Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, It's for you.
,SpongeBob:, Agent SpongeBob here.
,Mr. Krabs:, You found out what Plankton's up to?
,SpongeBob:, I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, find him, lad. I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Exactly. So get to work. ,[hangs up],
,Recording:, If you'd like to make a call, please deposit 25 cents. ,[SpongeBob gets out a quarter. Cut to the Chum Bucket at night. SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?
,Patrick:, I think the front door's open.
,SpongeBob:, Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside.
,Patrick:, This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants! ,[shoots a laser out of his behind and cuts out a square on the roof],
,SpongeBob:, Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn. ,[drops down inside, with the rope tied around him. He lowers himself but hits the floor], I thought you were holding the rope -- ,[Patrick lands on top of him],
,Patrick:, I am. You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission.
,Plankton:, ,[turns on the lights], Secret mission, eh? ,[they both scream and hold each other], Don't you think I know what you're up to?

,Patrick:, ,[nervously], SpongeBob, I have to go.
,SpongeBob:, Can't you go later?
,Patrick:, ,[groans], My laser pants aren't working right. ,[shoots a laser at the salt shaker on the other table. It vanishes. Patrick sighs],
,Plankton:, Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?
,Patrick:, No, thank you.
,Plankton:, Or perhaps a bran muffin?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I have to go now!
,Plankton:, Prune Danish? ,[sees Patrick's behind wiggle], What the...? ,[pan out to the Chum Bucket building where Patrick's laser pants makes holes everywhere as they all scream and destroys the Chum Bucket. Later, the floor opens up and a blimp emerges with Plankton controlling it from the inside], Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get! ,[flies his blimp over to the Krusty Krab. The inside of the Krusty Krab gets darker],
,Mr. Krabs:, Why's it dark? I think I put off my cataract surgery too long.
,Squidward:, No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sees the blimp], Merciful Neptune! ,[red light flashes], Man your battle stations!
,Squidward:, I'm on it! ,[runs into the bathroom and flushes a toilet],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[raises himself in the crow's nest], Bring it on, Plankton.
,Plankton:, Oh, I will. We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume. ,[Loud music starts playing. All the customers cover their ears],
,Nat:, Oh, brother, I hated the real version of this song. ,[The Krusty Krab customers start to leave],
,Mr. Krabs:, He's driving me customers away! All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly? ,[he presses a button, a vacuum comes out and sucks up all the customers], You can have 'em! ,[he launches the customers through a cannon aimed at the blimp],
,Plankton:, ,[as customers hit the blimp], Do your worst, Krabs!
,Squidward:, ,[hits the blimp], I hate my job. ,[he slides down],
,SpongeBob:, ,[watching from the top of the blimp], It's up to you and me, buddy!

,Mr. Krabs:, Ha ha ha! Huh? ,[gasps as the blimp, now on fire, is falling down to the Krusty Krab], No! ,[the blimp destroys the Krusty Krab],
,Plankton:, ,[standing on the Krusty Krab sign with a piece of paper in his hand], I win! I always win! ,[evil laugh],
,SpongeBob:, Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose.
,Plankton:, No, SpongeBob, I always... ,[he grabs his head and rips it off, turning into Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ...win!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[jumps off the sign], That's right! ,[he rips the body of Plankton's disguise off], I stole me own formula!
,SpongeBob:, But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's... ,[the other Mr. Krabs rips off his suit to show the Robot Krabs from ""Imitation Krabs""], Mr. Krabs is a robot! ,[Robot Krabs opens its head up to reveal Plankton],
,Plankton:, No, you idiot.
,SpongeBob:, Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here?
,Mr. Krabs:, You see, we had a bet. Plankton's been trying for twenty years to steal me formula, and he's never done it!
,Plankton:, I almost had it thirty-seven times, and you know it!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shows his claw at Plankton], Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet. ,[flashback to Mr. Krabs laughing while Plankton is crying on the ground], You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!
,Plankton:, ,[he stops crying], You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[he picks Plankton up], Oh, yeah, right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try.
,Plankton:, Ha! The usual wager?
,Mr. Krabs:, You're on. ,[flashback ends], So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each other's lives; and I beat Plankton at his own game. ,[points at the destroyed Chum Bucket], And destroyed his place of business! ,[laughs], Now pay up.
,Plankton:, Here you go, Eugene. ,[takes out a dollar], One a-dollar.
,Patrick:, Not so fast! ,[rips his bodysuit off to reveal Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward? Then who are you?
,Squidward:, I'm not... ,[SpongeBob tears off his face, revealing facial muscles], ...wearing a disguise. ,[he puts his face back on and walks away],
,SpongeBob:, Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be... ,[fake Squidward rips off his suit to reveal Sandy], ...Sandy?
,Sandy:, Whoops, wrong outfit. ,[rips off bodysuit to reveal another SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], You're me! Then I must be... ,[rips off his suit to reveal Patrick],
,Patrick:, Patrick!
,SpongeBob:, Nah, I'm just kidding. ,[rips off the SpongeBob suit and reveals another Patrick],
,Patrick:, I really am Patrick. ,[laughs. Other Patrick rips off his bodysuit to reveal SpongeBob again],
,SpongeBob:, Good one, Patrick! ,[both laugh], There's just one thing I don't understand.
,Mr. Krabs:, What's that, laddie?
,SpongeBob:, That. ,[points to two Patrick's laughing beside each other. Goes to black, ending the episode.],

"Plankton:, Spot? Spot? ,[looks under a can], Spot? Where are you, Spot? ,[whistles], Oh, there you are, boy! Come to me. Jump in my arms and give me your precious kisses.
,[Spot crawls over to Plankton, who appears to have grown fatter. Spot rolls himself over and flops on top of Plankton. Plankton pulls himself off of Spot.],
,Plankton:, Good amoeba. You get a num-num.
,[Spot eats the treat and swallows it.],
,Karen:, Plankton, have you been feeding Spot a lot of treats lately? ,[measures Spot with the measuring tape], He's looking bigger than usual.
,Plankton:, Karen! Not in front of the amoeba. Spot is fit as a fiddle.
,[Spot burps in Plankton's face.],
,Karen:, All right, Doctor. If you say so.
,Plankton:, Come on, I'll prove it.
,[The scene changes to Plankton hooking Spot to the analyzer.],
,Plankton:, Now you'll see how healthy my little Spotty-wotty is.
,[Plankton pulls down an x-ray and sees multiple baby amoeba puppies barking. The x-ray then reads, ""100% for sure pregnant.""],
,Plankton:, Wha—pregnant? Ah, that can't be right. I thought he was a boy.
,Karen:, I'm not sure it matters for amoebas. Food-rich environments cause amoebas to reproduce, and you've clearly provided a food-rich environment. ,[pets Spot as he whines], Who's gonna be a mama? Good boy!
,Plankton:, We're not ready to have puppies, Karen! This is all happening a little too fast. ,[grabs a spray bottle and sprays everywhere], We have to set up a state-of-the-art delivery room, sanitize everything, baby-proof the Chum Bucket—wait. Where's Spot?
,[Spot is in the closet, whining in the inside. Moments later, green slime comes spewing out from under the door.],
,Plankton:, What the...
,[Plankton scoops up some slime and sees tiny little amoeba puppies.],
,Plankton:, Puppies?
,[Karen opens the closet door and Spot comes out in his normal size.],
,Plankton:, You did it, boy! Oh, I'm so glad you're okay. ,[Spot licks him], Wait. Is that my good dinner jacket? ,[Spot barks],
,Karen:, ,[scoops up some of Spot's puppies and some slime], Oh, who cares about a dinner jacket? ,[rubs the slime and Spot's puppies all over her screen], Aw, look at the little puppies!
,Plankton:, Yeesh. Calm down, Karen. You don't want to blow out your motherboard.
,Karen:, Oh, I'm gonna name you Steven and Karen and Clayton and Vincent and—cute overload.
,[Karen's computer head spins rapidly, short circuits and blows out. Then her screen goes into rebooting.],
,Plankton:, Oh, sure, you take a couple of hours to reboot, Karen. It's fine. I'll just manage all these puppies all on my own!
,[The puppies bark and lick at each other. They form into a huge blob of slime and eat a stool. Then they jump on the monitor and eat it.],
,Plankton:, Hey! Get down from there! Stop that! My furniture!
,[The puppies eat the beakers and the chemicals vaporize the table.],
,Plankton:, My experiments! Bad amoebas! Bad! ,[Spot barks], I don't get it, Karen. Spot is so well behaved, but the puppies don't listen to me at all. I think we need to get rid of them.
,[Karen continues to reboot herself.],
,Plankton:, Yeah, I know what you would say. ,[imitates Karen], ""Don't you vaporize those puppies, Plankton.""
,[Karen continues to reboot herself.],
,Plankton:, Fine! If you insist, I'll find a non-vaporizing way to get rid of them. Jeez!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob skipping down the road, creating bubble shapes with his bubble wand along the way.],
,SpongeBob:, ♪La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la—♪ ,[stops], Huh? ,[his bubble wand makes a question mark bubble and sees Plankton making a sign], ""Free amoeba puppies?"" Oh, hey, Plankton. What's with the sign?
,Plankton:, I fed Spot too much, and he had puppies. You want a few thousand? ,[jumps down], They're free with an order of chum.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gags], No thank you, Plankton. I, uh, already ate. But I can help you get your puppies adopted. I did get Patrick into a good home.
,[Patrick is seen with Mr. Krabs on a leash and acts like a dog as he sniffs a fire hydrant.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You sure this is a guard dog, SpongeBob?
,[Patrick lifts his leg up as if he is about to pee. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton going to the Barg'N-Mart where two girl scout kids are selling cookies.],
,Girl Scout:, Would you like to purchase—
,Plankton:, ,[lifts the table away], This is our corner now!
,[The girls cry and run away.],
,SpongeBob:, Now, Plankton, just politely offer people free puppies, and they'll all be adopted in no time.
,Plankton:, ,[to Thaddeus], You there! I demand you take an amoeba puppy!
,[Plankton grabs one of the puppies. The amoeba puppy appears to be very small.],
,Thaddeus:, But that doesn't look like a puppy to me. More like a speck of dirt.
,Plankton:, These are purebred amoebas, swine! ,[pulls out a ray gun and shots rapidly at Thaddeus as he runs; a lady walks out of the store], Take this puppy or I'll destroy you!
,[The lady screams and runs away.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds out his eye], Maybe if people could see how cute these puppies are, ,[puts his eye back in his head], they'd be more interested in taking 'em.
,[SpongeBob grabs some of the slime and begins to mold it.],
,Plankton:, Wait, what are you doing?
,[SpongeBob molds the slime into different shapes like an accordion and a ball. Then the slime becomes the amoeba puppy that's just the right size.],
,SpongeBob:, Ta-da!
,Plankton:, I can't believe that actually worked.
,Dave:, Say, that's a fine-looking amoeba.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks! You want him? He's free to a good home.
,Dave:, ,[the puppy leaps into his arms], Whoo! ,[gets licked by the puppy and runs off],
,Mrs. Puff:, Do you have another amoeba? They are too adorable.
,Plankton:, Smoosh up some more puppies, SpongeBob. We are in business!
,SpongeBob:, I'm smooshin'! I'm smooshin'!
,[SpongeBob takes the box full of amoebas and slime and dumps them onto his body. Then he absorbs them and smooshes them up for a bit. Then he spouts out some more amoeba puppies and gives them to the customers. The amoeba puppies bark.],
,Customers:, Aww.
,[The scene changes to Mrs. Puff's house.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Don't be sad, Matilda. Mommy has to go to her arraignment, but she'll be back soon. ,[blows kisses her puppy and leaves],
,[The puppy scratches the door as it whines. Suddenly, the puppy rips some wallpaper off the wall and knocks over some stuff. It jumps onto some shelves and breaks some of Mrs. Puff's valuable items, as well as ripping a hole in the wall. Then it opens a jewelry box, swallows a necklace and jumps out the window. Meanwhile at the Chum Bucket, an amoeba puppy runs up to the front door and happily jumps up and down as it barks.],
,Plankton:, Puppy? You came back?
,[The puppy jumps into Plankton's arms and licks him.],
,Plankton:, ,[notices the necklace], Did you take this from your new owner? That is rude, puppy! Very, very rude! ,[notices all the puppies with stuff they stole in their bodies], Wait, you all took something...and brought it back to me? Hmm... ,[grins evilly as he got an idea], I don't need any of this junk.
,[Plankton pulls out the necklace from the puppy's body. He claps his hands and the puppies spit out various stuff.],
,Plankton:, But perhaps there is something you can do for me, ,[throws away the stuff], like the Krabby Patty secret formula? ,[cackles and coughs], Anyone happen to steal a throat lozenge? No? Okay. Come on, pups! We've got some training to do— ,[stops and sees a motionless Karen still rebooting herself with the stuff piled on her], Still rebooting, huh?
,[The puppies run up and chew up all of the stuff they stole off of Karen.],
,Plankton:, I might need someone to help train these amoebas.
,[The puppies are chewing up all over the place. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm glad you called me, Plankton. I am the best pet trainer in all of Bikini Bottom. ,[pulls up his pants], Why, Patrick is already housebroken.
,[At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is cleaning up the mess Patrick made on the rug.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grumbling], Oh, yeah, he'll just use the litter box. ,[sprays Patrick in the face], Bad Patrick. ,[Patrick whimpers], Bad Patrick Star.
,SpongeBob:, To train a puppy, one must think like a puppy. ,[morphs into an amoeba puppy and barks],
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob, who is still morphed into an amoeba puppy, providing a class session for the amoeba puppies.],
,SpongeBob:, Woof, woof, woof! ,[sits down],
,[The puppies sit down like SpongeBob did. The scene changes to Plankton unlocking a door.],
,Plankton:, Voilà! Eh?
,[The puppy liquefies itself and flies through the keyhole. Then it opens the door behind it. The scene changes back to SpongeBob with the other puppies.],
,SpongeBob:, Woof!
,[The puppies stack up together and SpongeBob goes on top.],
,SpongeBob:, Woof, woof, woof!
,[The scene changes to Plankton activating a hand bomb and throws it for the puppy to catch. The puppy comes back and places it down. Plankton screams as he drops the other hand bomb. The two hand bombs collide and explode, leaving Plankton charred. The scene changes back to SpongeBob and Plankton.],
,Plankton:, Well, SpongeBob, after several grueling hours of training, the puppies are ready. Allow me to introduce them. ,[pushes button and reveals a puppy with hand bombs strapped in itself], There's Demolitions Puppy.
,[The puppy activated the hand bomb, swallows it, and it explodes inside its body.],
,Plankton:, Acrobat Puppy.
,[The puppy with a yellow shirt and red stars flips over with spiky steel cleats.],
,Plankton:, Identical Twin Puppies.
,[The two puppies, with pink shirts, multiply into two.],
,Plankton:, And of course, Comic Relief Puppy.
,[The puppy, with a clown suit, sprays itself with the flower.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[becoming suspicious], Hey, is this another plan to steal the secret formula?
,Plankton:, Of course it is, and there's nothing you can do about it! ,[laughs and pushes the button],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[gets lifted], Whoa! ,[screams as he is thrown in a cage], You'll never get away with this, Plankton!
,Plankton:, Oh, but I will get away with this, Plankton! I mean, SpongeBob. Allow me to explain.
,[As he explains, the puppies make their way to the Krusty Krab.],
,Plankton:, First, we'll need a distraction inside the Krusty Krab. That's where the Identical Twin Puppies come into play.
,[One of the Identical Twin Puppies jumps onto the table and barks happily.],
,Frankie Billy:, Aww, I want one. It's so—
,[The customers murmur in awe. Then the other Identical Twin Puppy barks at the other table. The customers look at the puppy in affection. The other puppy jumps at another table and the customers follow it, back and forth. Mr. Krabs and Squidward shrug their shoulders as they have no clue what is going on.],
,Plankton:, Free from Krabs' watchful eye, Acrobat Puppy can begin his infiltration.
,[The Acrobat Puppy liquefies itself into the air vent and makes its way into Mr. Krabs' office. While Patrick is sleeping, the Acrobat Puppy sneaks by quietly and gets to the window.],
,Plankton:, Once Acrobat Puppy gets inside Krabs' office, he'll open the window for Demolitions Puppy.
,[The Acrobat Puppy opens the window and the Demolitions Puppy jumps in and hops onto the safe.],
,Plankton:, Then, Demolitions Puppy will blow the safe wide open.
,[The Demolitions Puppy draws a circle around the safe and puts a bomb on it. The Acrobat Puppy pushes the button and the bomb explodes, opening the safe. Then, the Demolitions Puppy grabs the formula and hops off the safe.],
,Plankton:, With the safe open, the formula is mine! And finally, just for fun, Comic Relief Puppy adds a dollop of humor.
,[The Comic Relief Puppy sprays water in SpongeBob's eyes and pies itself with a pie.],
,SpongeBob:, That's never gonna work.
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], But it already has! ,[notices the puppies with the formula], What do you think the puppies have been doing all this time? Now to open my prize! ,[struggles to open the bottle],
,[Things start to look bleak for SpongeBob as if Plankton has finally won. However, when he notices Karen rebooting herself, he gets a idea. He takes out his right eye, throws it and knocks over Karen.],
,Plankton:, Karen! Baby! ,[runs over to her and tries to lift her up],
,[SpongeBob whistles and the puppies remove their clothes.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[morphs into an amoeba puppy], Woof, woof, ruff, ruff, woof, woof!
,[The puppies stack themselves up and push the lever up. The cage opens.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[hops out and changes back], Woof, woof!
,[SpongeBob runs over to Plankton as he gets Karen back up.],
,SpongeBob:, Plankton! Won't you ever learn? You're never gonna get the formula!
,Plankton:, Come on, SpongeBob. Maybe we can work something out! I'll give ya 10% of my patty profits. Huh?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Plankton. You leave me no choice. ,[dumps amoeba treats on top of Plankton],
,Plankton:, ,[grunts], Uh-oh.
,[The puppies run over and start eating all of the treats. As they eat, they grow larger and start to expand. The Chum Bucket explodes as the puppies' growth overloads the restaurant. The puppies fly back down and drops the formula. The bottle rolls back to the Krusty Krab, where Patrick and Mr. Krabs are standing outside. Patrick finds the formula and picks it up.],
,Patrick:, I believe this is yours.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! Good boy, Patrick! You get a treat!
,[Mr. Krabs feeds Patrick a bone and gets licked by him.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay. No, wait! I—Get offa me! What are you—
,[The Chum Bucket is completely destroyed and Karen finishes rebooting herself.],
,Karen:, Reboot...complete. Oh! Oh! Oh ha! More puppies? For me?! Oh, Sheldon, I couldn't be happier! ,[laughing],
,[Karen grabs some of the slime with the amoeba puppies and smooshes it into a really large puppy.],
,Plankton:, Wait, puppy. Whoa, puppy! ,[gets crushed by the large puppy], Ooh! Cute...overload! Aah!

"[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is pulling a trashcan, with Patrick inside, out through the door. Then he pushes it onto the curb.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew!
,[A mail truck drives by and drops a package on the curb.],
,SpongeBob:, What's that?
,Patrick:, ,[pops out of trashcan], Looks like a box.
,SpongeBob:, Wonder who it belongs to. ,[jumps on the box], Maybe it says on the other side.
,Both:, Nope.
,Patrick:, Oh, look, it's open.
,SpongeBob:, It is?
,Patrick:, ,[opens the box], Yup.
,SpongeBob:, ,[peeks inside the box], Ooh. ,[climbs in the box], It's—it's— ,[whimpers], It's stuff! ,[holds up a big pile of sporting equipment],

,[The sporting equipment falls on SpongeBob and Patrick. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick in the library with a golf club.],
,Both:, Hmm.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, this must be for getting books off the top shelf. ,[knocks books off the top shelf with the golf club],

,Patrick:, Wow.

,Patrick:, This must be a whipped cream holder.
,[Patrick takes a bottle of whipped cream and pours some through the finger holes on the bowling ball. Then he eats the whipped cream from the ball, but he drops it in his mouth. Then he falls through the floor and into the basement.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah! Patrick, are you okay?
,[Patrick licks some whipped cream from the bowling ball.],
,Patrick:, Yum.

,[Squidward runs to the back where SpongeBob and Patrick are wrecking up his garden with a soccer ball and tennis rackets.],
,Both:, Hi-yah! ,[laughs],

,Both:, Equipment?
,Squidward:, You don't know what this stuff is?!
,Both:, Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
,Squidward:, This is a soccer ball...,[kicks the soccer ball in SpongeBob's face], that is a tennis racket, ,[shoves the tennis racket in SpongeBob's face], and these are a couple of morons! ,[bashes SpongeBob and Patrick's face into each other], Now, be quiet! And clean up all of your sports junk!
,Both:, ,[confused], What's a ""sportz?""
,Squidward:, ,[groans], Sports are games you play for points. The points determine the winner of the game.
,Patrick:, Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I love games!
,SpongeBob:, Me too! You must know a lot about ""sportz,"" Squidward. Will you teach us how to play?
,Squidward:, I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than—
,[Squidward's angel appears on his right shoulder.],
,Angel Squidward:, Now now, Squidward. You need to help them. Played incorrectly, sports can be very dangerous.
,[Squidward's devil appears on his left shoulder.],

,Patrick:, ,[his face puffs up], My face hurts.
,Squidward:, Oh, no, no, no. You both did good. Pain is—uh, worth points. You know the phrase, ""no pain, no gain.""
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], I want pain points! ,[kicks his horseshoe and a seahorse falls on him],
,Squidward:, Yeah, that's great. Now do it—oh, 100 more times. ,[throws the horseshoe],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah!

,SpongeBob:, Ow! 
,[SpongeBob and Patrick keep hitting themselves with each other's horseshoe while Squidward lays back and watches them in amusement.],

,[SpongeBob and Patrick start running, but as they running, they are having a hard time running with the ice skates as they appear to be uncomfortable. SpongeBob trips and falls, getting sand with worms in his mouth.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[spits the sand out of his mouth], Squidward, are you sure we're doing this right? These running shoes are really hurting my ankles.
,Squidward:, Oh, you're absolutely doing it right. Try to pick up the pace, though.

,Patrick:, Comin' through!
,[The two halves of SpongeBob stand up and goes to catch up to Patrick. Two sharks come by and notices what SpongeBob and Patrick are doing.],

,Shark Dad:, No, son. We're sports ""fans."" We just watch.
,[The Shark Dad pulls up a chair and sits down while his son takes up a foam hand. SpongeBob and Patrick made it to the finishing line.],

In the backyard, there's a sporting arena containing several different fields: a baseball field, a bowling rink, a soccer field, a basketball court, a football field, a golf course, and some gymnasium sections. SpongeBob is holding up a catcher's mitt and a tennis racket while wearing a headband. Patrick shoots footballs in SpongeBob's face with the football shooter. SpongeBob comes back with footballs lodged in his mouth and gives a thumbs up. The scoreboard changes from 70 to 72, and they're still tied. Patrick hits the bowling ball with the golf club, but the club breaks and hits SpongeBob in the face. The scoreboard changes from 82 to 84, and they're still tied.

,Shark Son:, It's the rule giver.
,[The crowd murmurs as Don the Whale, Frank the Muscular Goldfish, and Larry the Lobster carry Squidward, who is in a grim reaper outfit, onto the field. They set him down and the crowd cheers.],
,Sandy:, I ain't never heard of a rule giver.
,Squidward:, ,[flips his hood], I prefer ""King of Sports,"" but you can never tell what will catch on with the small folk.
,Sandy:, You're making up a game where SpongeBob and Patrick hurt themselves, and you won't let them stop?!
,Squidward:, I'm just giving the people what they want.
,Sandy:, That's pretty low, Squidward, even for you. I'm putting a stop to this. SpongeBob and Patrick have had enough!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick appear brutally beaten up by Squidward's so-called games.],
,Squidward:, See? They're fine. Let the games resume.
,[Sandy grumbles and the audience cheers.],
,Sandy:, Oh, I don't think so. Y'all want to see a game? Fine. Squidward, I challenge you to a game—a game of basketball. Winner decides the fate of SpongeBob and Patrick.
,[Sandy throws basketballs in Squidward's face.],
,Squidward:, Huh? ,[the crowd cheers], Me? Play sports? No, no. I'm mostly in an advisory position.
,Jimmy Gus:, Aw, come on! We came to see some action! Play the squirrel! Play the squirrel!
,Crowd:, Play the squirrel! Play the squirrel!
,Sandy:, See you on the court, Your Highness. ,[shoves the crown down Squidward's face],

,Sandy:, Hey, Squidward, one more thing. We're playing San Antonio rules.
,Squidward:, San ""A—what—io"" rules?
,Sandy:, Check!
,[Sandy throws the basketball in Squidward's belly. Then she jumps onto Squidward's head and shoots the basketball into the net. The crowd cheers.],
,Squidward:, Oh, that was a foul!
,Sandy:, Tell it to your mama, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Mama?
,Mrs. Tentacles:, Don't want to hear it.
,Sandy:, Next round's soccer.
,Squidward:, What the what?
,Sandy:, Sure. Every time you score, you pick a new sport. I thought you knew all the rules, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Well, uh, yeah, well, of course I do. Yeah.
,Sandy:, Good, then block this!
,Squidward:, ,[notices the soccer net in back of him], Block what?
,[Sandy kicks the soccer ball and headbutts into the net. The net bounces the ball back, hitting Squidward in the head. Squidward pulls his head back up and the crowd cheers.],
,Squidward:, Oh, come on, I wasn't even ready!
,Sandy:, No time outs! Football round!
,[The horn blares and Sandy charges towards Squidward with the football. She rams Squidward onto the football goalpost. Then she throws the football with her tail through the goalpost. The football hits Squidward and the crowd cheers.],
,Squidward:, ,[panting], Just give me a second to—
,[Sandy comes up from behind and stuffs Squidward in a jellyfishing net. She swings the net and sends Squidward flying to the soccer ball goal and into the pooling table. Squidward pulls himself out of the table. Sandy hits the eight ball and it flies into Squidward's head. The eight ball comes out through Squidward's nose. Sandy takes out a plate and Squidward's face falls into pieces. Squidward's face is now made into calamari.],
,Announcer:, And the winner is...Sandy Cheeks!

This stylish, fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic restroom facilities standard, and for the affordable price of $9,595.95! Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune!?
,Gary:, Mooowww.

,Angry Jack:, And remember, I'll match, or beat, anyone advertised rage or is absolutely... hey. ,[Sees SpongeBob], What are you doing in my commercial?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sorry, Angry Jack, eh, Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now?
,Angry Jack:, Nah, I just do that to make my commercials louder. And louder, is the same as better! Now, let's see if I can't get you into a new shell. Hmmm. ,[starts scanning shelves], There she is. ,[Takes the same shell as Gary's old one], There ya go, little guy.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy? ,[Shell falls off and breaks],
,SpongeBob:, Now, it... really looks like the old one, eh, buddy?
,Gary:, ,[Angry tone of voice], Meowwweeooowww!
,Angry Jack:, Hey, accidents'll happen. Why don't we try this one? ,[Picks up yellow shell with orange patches],
,SpongeBob:, Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it, but first I gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off, eh, buddy? ,[SpongeBob pushes down shell so hard it cracks and breaks. Angry Jack looks at SpongeBob angrily],
,SpongeBob:, Oops. Hey, what about that one? ,[Walks to a shell with purple and orange stripes on it. Turns around to take to Gary, but whacks it on Angry Jack],
,SpongeBob:, Oops, sorry, Jack. Hey, how much is that one? ,[Picks up shades of pink stripes. Trips over lace and drops shell],
,Angry Jack:, Why don't you just hold your snail? I'll take care of the shells.
,SpongeBob:, Good idea, Angry.
,Angry Jack:, So, how do ya like this one? ,[Puts on very bright-lighted shell],
,SpongeBob:, Well it... certainly is shiny.
,Angry Jack:, It's our most reflective model.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, that is bright. Can't... see! OW, what was that!? ,[Bashes into shell shelves and knocks them over one by one. Shelves knock each other over like dominoes. Some shell shelves spell 'oops'],
,SpongeBob:, Why... can't... I... stop... break-ing... shells!? ,[Screams and falls off shelf he was running along. View from outside Angry Jack's store],
,SpongeBob:, Whoops. Hey, Jack, I don't suppose you have any more to show me?
,Angry Jack:, I do have one more available. It's the only certified indestructible shell I've ever seen, but I'm sure you'll find a way.
,SpongeBob:, Wait, wait, wait! Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first, ,[shoes pop from under shell bits], shoes are tied, hands are de-ry ,[pronounced dry], and now, a thick layer of bubble wrap. ,[starts wrapping shell in bubble wrap. Picks up shell, but the actual shell falls out of the bubble wrap layer and breaks],
,SpongeBob:, You, er... sure you don't have any more in the back?
,Angry Jack:, The back? There is no back anymore.
,SpongeBob:, Well, look on the bright side, I reduced your inventory for ya.
,Angry Jack:, Reduced? You destroyed everything! AND NOW, YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY!
,SpongeBob:, Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder?
,Angry Jack:, I'm really angry!
,Commercial Voice:, Blistering Fury!
,Angry Jack:, And I demand immediate payment!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Takes about 40 cents out his pocket], Take it, it's all my savings.
,Angry Jack:, This? This isn't enough to repay my fortune! I'm gonna need more!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, that's all I got, honest.
,Angry Jack:, No, it's not! You've got two arms and two legs, don't ya?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Angry Jack:, Give me one of each!
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[Takes off one arm and one leg and gives them to Angry Jack],
,Angry Jack:, I'll also need some internal organs. ,[SpongeBob takes out his heart and gives it to Angry Jack], And an eyeball! ,[SpongeBob hands over an eyeball], And your clothes. ,[SpongeBob refuses and walks away fully formed again],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages. ,[sees box], Hey, I've got an idea! ,[SpongeBob draws a shell pattern on the box],
,Gary:, ,[angry tone], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary, it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody!
,Gary:, ,[starts to cry], Mwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaa!
,SpongeBob:, ,[crying], Oh, what am I kidding? It looks terrible on you!
,Gary:, Mwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaa!
,SpongeBob:, ,[crying], I know, Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?!? ,[sobbing],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, boy, what's with all that snivelin'?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing here?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I just, uh, well never mind that, boy. What's your problem?
,SpongeBob:, I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement... So I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug! ,[bawling],
,Gary:, Mwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaa!
,Mr. Krabs:, There, there, boy. There, there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll thinka something.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at Mr. Krabs' shiny shell and has an idea], Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times. I love helping others. Like helping meself. Now, how much ya got?
,SpongeBob:, Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh. I see ,[walks away disappointed],
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, work for free for the rest of the year.
,Mr. Krabs:, Only if I get to cut your health benefit for ya.
,SpongeBob:, Deal! ,[Cut to SpongeBob's house, he has the same nightmare from the beginning, and woke up again], Oh, another bad dream. ,[Screams, He shines a flashlight at Gary], Mr. Krabs?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sorry, Gary, I'm not used to your new shell. ,[Mr. Krabs comes in],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, me boy, I need to borrow a blanket.
,SpongeBob:, There ya go, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks, boy-o. Now I'm all toasty.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], I guess ""All's shell that ends shell"". Huh, Gary? ,[laughs], That's a good one! ,[Gary goes furious and crawls back, Gary slams the door locking SpongeBob out], Gary? ,[pounds on the door], Gary? ,[Gary turns off the bedroom light], Gary?!

"[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is washing the windows while singing.],
,SpongeBob:, ♪Ooooooooo-oooooooohhh-woh-woooh, how much chum could a sea slug chug if a sea slug could chug...♪ ,[gasps, since he notices something outside, he then uses a pay phone to call Mr. Krabs in his office], Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!
,Mr. Krabs:, Please deposit 25 cents to continue this call.
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, Mr. K. ,[SpongeBob inserts a quarter into the pay phone], Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here! It's a code blue situation!
,Mr. Krabs:, Code blue?! ,[Mr. Krabs runs out of his office], What's the matter, boy?
,SpongeBob:, I think Plankton wants to destroy our way of life.
,Mr. Krabs:, Man alive! ,[Plankton has a wrecking ball near the Krusty Krab], He's taking us down!
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Get ready, Krabs, ,[pulls a lever], for the surprise of your life!
,Mr. Krabs:, Brace yourself! ,[Mr. Krabs hides under a table, and SpongeBob hides under a barrel, the wrecking ball then misses the Krusty Krab], Huh? ,[the wrecking ball swings above and destroys the Chum Bucket], Plankton's destroying the Chum Bucket? Heh, heh, I guess he's finally given up on the restaurant business. Couldn't take the competition. ,[a bulldozer then drags a giant Coliseum to where the Chum Bucket was], What is that? ,[a giant monitor appears on top of the Coliseum, and Plankton appears on it],
,Plankton:, Greetings, citizens of Bikini Bottom. Behold my imperial Chum Coliseum! ,[nobody is excited], I vow to introduce to this fair city, culture, in the form of hand to hand grappling! ,[nobody is excited, once again], I intend to enrich your lives culturally, by exhibiting the moist spectacle of gladiators in mortal conflict! ,[no one is excited], My corporate underwriters told me to mention that it's free! ,[everyone is excited, and they run into the coliseum], Come one! Come all! Remember, kids love gladiators.
,Debbie:, Wow, real-life conflict, for free!
,Nathiel:, Let the horror show begin! ,[everyone in the Krusty Krab runs to the coliseum],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs evilly], Oh, Karen, even though you're just a frigid machine, your circuits must be welling up with emotion at my latest achievement.
,Karen:, Oh, yes, my resisters are simply gushing from their copper foil traces.
,Plankton:, This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!
,Karen:, That's what you said when you tried to boil Krabs in a giant bisque.
,Plankton:, I can still feel the burns, which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver. And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers. And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife. ,[Karen shuts down], Uh, sorry, honey.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!
,Mr. Krabs:, I agree, it's very suspicious. And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers, know quality when they taste it! So let's get in there, and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about! ,[they walk into the Krusty Krab, and it's empty], Where's all my loyal customers?
,Squidward:, They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street.
,Mr. Krabs:, That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave,
,Mama Krabs:, I'm right here!
,Mr. Krabs:, ... but when he steals me customers, then I push back! Gentlemen, to the coliseum! ,[cuts to the coliseum where there is a sign that says ""GLADIATOR FIGHT 2-DAY!,"" Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Squidward sit down], This reeks of evil. And I'm going to sniff out the source. ,[Mr. Krabs sniffs, Plankton appears],
,Plankton:, Welcome one and all, to the first bi-annual big arena of annihilation! ,[everyone cheers],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo!
,Plankton:, Brought to you by yours truly. So without further ado, let the mauling begin! ,[Everyone cheers again],
,Scooter:, All right!
,SpongeBob:, Yay! ,[Plankton releases a lionfish into the ring, everyone cheers again], Whoo! Isn't this a boat load of fun, Squidward? I can't wait to see the poor sucker who has to go against that beast!
,Squidward:, You call this fun? This is just cheap, uncultured lay sport.
,Plankton:, Now, release the opponent.
,SpongeBob:, Yes! ,[Plankton releases Patrick into the ring, everyone cheers again. SpongeBob is horrified once he notices], Patrick? How could they? This is horrible! ,[cries],
,Squidward:, This is fabulous! ,[laughs],
,Plankton:, Enough dilly-dallying. Send out the blood sausages! ,[two muscular fish put a necklace of sausages on Patrick],
,Patrick:, All right! ,[Patrick is about to eat a sausage, when the lionfish growls at him, Plankton laughs],
,Plankton:, That pink dimwit doesn't stand a chance with those sausages around his throat! As soon as the smell of sausage hits that ravenous lionfish's nostrils, he'll be all over Patrick like mold on a shower curtain!
,Sally:, Rip his sausages off!
,Patrick:, Ohh. Nice kitty. ,[notices sausages. He takes one off], Here, kitty. Want a sausage? A nice, delicious, tasty... sausage. ,[takes a bite out of the sausage, the lion snatches it from him, and growls at him], Spawn of a gefilte fish! ,[runs from the lionfish],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Squidward is enjoying the show], I can't sit here and watch this! That's my best friend out there! ,[SpongeBob jumps into a chariot, dressed in knight attire and goes toward Patrick], Patrick!
,Patrick:, What? Oh, oh it's you. Hey, how's it going, buddy?
,SpongeBob:, No time for chit chat, get in! ,[SpongeBob pulls Patrick inside the chariot], Hurry up, Nelly!
,Nat:, Boo!
,Mama Krabs:, Boring! ,[throws a tomato at the ground], I want to see some body parts!
,Mr. Krabs:, Mom!
,Plankton:, This is ridiculous! I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act! Time for phase 2! ,[cuts to Plankton with a Chum Stick in hand, walking around the Coliseum], Chum on a stick! Get your fresh chum right here! Some chum for you miss?
,Sadie:, Well, all this waiting around for someone to get mauled is making me a bit hungry.
,Plankton:, Here, take this one. It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality.
,Sadie:, Why, thank you.
,Plankton:, Just ten dollars, please.
,Sadie:, Ten dollars? Why would I pay ten dollars, when I can go across the street and get a Krabby Patty for one dollar?
,Mr. Krabs:, Exactly!
,Plankton:, You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?
,Sadie:, No, I suppose not.
,Plankton:, Ten dollars, or the fight's off!
,Sadie:, Ah, fine, whatever.
,Plankton:, Here you are. I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you all ready.
,[Sadie takes it annoyed, eats it, and spits it out immediately.],
,Sadie:, That was appalling! What was in that?
,Plankton:, Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust. ,[Sadie coughs and gags, then pukes in one of the rows of stadium seating],
,Sadie:, ,[her lower lip is covered with a lot of spit], Oh, barnacles. That's foul! ,[everyone tries to leave, but Plankton locks all of the exits],
,Plankton:, Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees everyday! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's ""boring,"" or the food's ""inedible."" So sit down, enjoy the show, and buy some chum! ,[everyone walks back to their seat with a chum stick annoyed once again, scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, What do we do now, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Don't worry, I'm all ready doing it. ,[Patrick is eating a sausage],
,SpongeBob:, NO! ,[slaps the sausage out of his hands], Patrick, now is not the time for eating, now is the time to avoid being eaten by that giant... Huh? ,[the lion eats the sausage that SpongeBob slapped out of Patrick's hand, then resumes to chase them again], That's it, Patrick! He's not chasing us, he's chasing those tasty, tender, delicious, succulent sausages around your neck. ,[SpongeBob throws the sausages off of Patrick],
,Plankton:, Chum on a stick. Get your chum. ,[notices sausages], What the? ,[sausages land on Plankton], Oh, great! Now how am I going to entertain the masses? ,[lion growls at him], Hey watch where you're... ,[notices the lion, as it growls at him], Oh dear! ,[screams, then the lion growls at him once again, Plankton runs out of a tiny door], Phew. Good thing I thought ahead, with that escape door. Try and catch me now, you prissy feline! ,[laughs, then the lion busts a hole, allowing him to get out, Plankton screams, as it starts to chase him], NO! Nice kitty. Want some chum? ,[he whimpers. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where all of the customers are returned again],
,Mr. Krabs:, You know I'm not one to give out comments likely, I've gotta hand it to you boy, ,[referring to SpongeBob], if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!
,SpongeBob:, My pleasure captain!
,Patrick:, Yeah, thanks, buddy! You really saved my behind! No joke! ,[shows that there is a hole in his pants, revealing his butt from the fight],
,Mr. Krabs:, I think that it's safe to say, that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty, of me good customers.
,Scooter:, One Krabby Patty, please.
,Mr. Krabs:, But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars.
,Scooter:, Ten dollars? What happened to one dollar?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert. ,[the ""financial expert"" is revealed to be the lion that was chasing Plankton that is all chained up, Scooter is scared, and gives Mr. Krabs ten dollars],
,Scooter:, ,[muttering], Stupid inflation.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks for your business. ,[everyone laughs, they stop and walk away, the lion then growls, and the episode comes to an end],

,Nat:, Neptune's turned up quite a gale tonight. He must be mad about something.
,Shubie:, Ha! Hahaha! That's silly. Everyone knows Poseidon is the ruler of the undersea. ,[bag of goulash blows out of Shubie's hand], Oh. My leftovers.
,Nat:, Nooo! ,[sobs], Why, dear Neptune? ,[SpongeBob snores. Bag of goulash breaks through the window and lands on SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash. ,[SpongeBob opens window], Hey, anyone out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello? ,[wind makes music through SpongeBob's pores], My pores are whistling in the wind. ,[SpongeBob jumps outside. SpongeBob makes music and laughs. Jellyfish comes to SpongeBob], Hahahahaha! That tickles! ,[Jellyfish buzzes to music], Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores. ,[Jellyfish goes into SpongeBob's head.

,Moon:, ,[yawning], Well, my shift's over.
,Sun:, Time for work, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, All right, Jelly, out you go. ,[he takes a deep breath, and shoots the jellyfish out from one of the holes in his head.], It's been a lot of fun, but I gotta get to work. ,[jellyfish follows], Quite a wind this morning, eh, Jelly? ,[wind blows SpongeBob away], Whoa! ,[more jellyfish come], Hey, Sparky, can you tell your friends I can't play right now? ,[the jellyfish tickles SpongeBob, SpongeBob laughs uncontrollably], Stop it! ,[continues laughing, until SpongeBob lets go of the rocks], Whoa! ,[SpongeBob lands back in bed], Oh! I'm going to be late! ,[SpongeBob runs out the door. Jellyfish pick him up], I told you guys, I don't have time to play right now! ,[SpongeBob gets blown back], I have not been tardy one time in my career as a fry cook and I'm not going to start today! ,[SpongeBob gets slung out of his home and back],

,SpongeBob:, I am sorry, Mr. Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work!
,Mr. Krabs:, Jellyfish?
,SpongeBob:, They're attracted to my whistley holes.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, I'll never understand what you just said, but if it's transportation you need, I know just the thing. ,[Mr. Krabs casts a fishing rod which hooks onto SpongeBob by one of his pores], Ooh, this one's puttin' up a fight. ,[SpongeBob is dragging on the ground], Fightin' too hard! ,[shows SpongeBob getting tossed in the air], Gotta reel him in, Krabs.

Heh, I'm trying to work here.,[Jellyfish come in through the chimney, SpongeBob runs to Patrick's rock.],
,[In Patrick's house],
,Weatherman:, The weather situation is much worse across the country.
,Bob:, And it looks like these winds aren't going to stop any time soon. ,[TV reporter gets blown away],

,Barbara:, And that's the way it is in your world today. ,[Patrick throws ice cream cone at TV],
,Patrick:, Boring! I don't want to watch any of this boring stuff. I wanna watch something decent like--
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I don't have any time. I gotta hide from these jellyfish.
,Patrick:, What jellyfish?
,SpongeBob:, Ever since the wind started, a sound blows through my holes that jellyfish seem to love. ,[Patrick's rock opens and jellyfish come in],
,Patrick:, Hey, fella. ,[jellyfish stings Patrick], Owww! ,[Angry], SpongeBob, get out of here! ,[jellyfish blow him away], I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but you have become a negative influence!
,SpongeBob:, Hahahaha! At least the wind stopped. ,[jellyfish sting SpongeBob. SpongeBob hides in cave], I think I lost them. Well, I guess I'll just stay here where it's safe... and quiet... and dark. Don't worry, I'll just stay here for a second. Behind these rocks. These sanitary, lifeless rocks.

Oh, you can have it all. ,[puts all the sugar in tea], I feel comfortable around you. ,[sugar crumble in mouth], Can I confess something? Cause I know you'll understand. I have this... problem. I seem to attract jellyfish! Hahahaha! How do you work that out? Hmmmmm. ,[SpongeBob stone stays still], Yeah, yeah. I'm in a loss, too. Oh, barnacles. I'm gonna be stuck in this cave forever! ,[sighs. SpongeBob's stone replica pores make music as the wind blows through], Of course, buddy. Brilliant idea! ,[SpongeBob takes stone outside], Let's see what happens this time. ,[jellyfish come], Whoooaaa, here they come! Go get 'em, buddy! ,[jellyfish hate the music and buzz over to SpongeBob], Hey, guys. What do you think about my little friend's song? ,[SpongeBob's stone replica plays foul notes], Is there something wrong? ,[jellyfish sting SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs back to cave], Hmmmmm. I crafted one stone SpongeBob that provided a note in a foul key. But if I crafted another, ,[pulls down extremely complicated equation on a blackboard], the dimension of the hollow center multiplied by the number of holes may offer another tune. One that could soothe those jellyfish. But which one is the right size?! Hmm. I'll just have to make a bunch of them. ,[SpongeBob makes the eight musical stones], All right. That oughta do her. ,[SpongeBob stones produce melodious notes in the breeze], WOW. It actually worked... Ah. They're finally leaving me alone. I can go back to work now! ,[laughs], Krusty Krab, here I come! ,[SpongeBob gasps and stops running], How long was I gone?! ,[SpongeBob finds Krusty Krab buried in sand], No! No! No!

,Patrick:, Hang in there, buddy. we'll have you fixed up in no time. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick carry Squidward to the hospital],
,Purple Doctorfish:, Hmmm?
,SpongeBob:, So what's the prognosis, doctor?
,Purple Doctorfish:, Your friend has a condition known by the medical term of Head-go-boom-boom-itis. Not to worry, though, he should recover over normally over time, but he mustn't receive any more blows to the head or he may remain this way permanently. Just care for him as if he were your very own bouncy baby boy and he'll be fine. ,[cuts to SpongeBob's house],
,Patrick:, Hey, little Squidward. Ready to have some fun? Woop-ee-doo! ,[throws Squidward up to ceiling],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squiddy! Din din is ready. Where is our little miracle? ,[shows Squidward stuck in ceiling], Patrick, how could you! ,[climbs up Patrick and pulls Squidward out of ceiling], There, there! My little darling.

,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties. ,[turns around to show Mr. Krabs that Squidward is a baby. Squidward makes baby noises], The poor guy has the mind of an infant.
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money. ,[shows customers outside begging to come in with their money],
,SpongeBob:, But...
,Mr. Krabs:, No buts! Get to work, you two!

Now let's make it official! ,[hands Squidward a hat, which he rejects], Oh, how silly of me! ,[grabs a high chair and picks up Squidward], Squiddy needs a high chair! ,[puts the high chair near the register and puts Squidward in it.

I can also count on, huh... ,[notices that Squidward doodled on the pieces of paper], Will this be for here or to goo? ,[peeks out the kitchen window, where Squidward is laughing and tossing the papers around], We have to work on your penmanship, Squiddy. ,[Squidward laughs and doodles on Nat's face],

"Narrator:, Ah, The Goo Lagoon. Where the sun is hot and the sunbathers are oh so cool. ,[SpongeBob is laying on his back on a towel],
,SpongeBob:, What a beautiful day.
,Patrick:, You said it, pal.
,SpongeBob:, Can you believe that sun? ,[Patrick's eyes are small],
,Patrick:, I could look at it all day. ,[SpongeBob sits up then takes his sunglasses off],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Patrick? ,[Patrick's eyes go back to normal after he takes a drink],
,Patrick:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Nothing.
,Patrick:, So, how's that tan coming?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. Let me check. ,[lifts his pants and looks at his tan], Looking good. How's yours?
,Patrick:, Just a minute, Ah! ,[lifts his shorts and his rear-end is showing. Patrick lays on his stomach], I could have sworn I was laying on my back. ,[both laugh as a swarm of people run by them. Larry is lifting six people on a surfboard. Everyone cheers],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard. ,[three girls walk up to Larry],
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Mr. Lifeguard, can I feel your muscle?
,Larry:, Sure. Don't scratch the paint. ,[Nancy and friends run off after feeling Larry's muscles. Scooter and friends come up next],
,Scooter:, Lifeguard, hows’s the tubage?
,Larry:, Gnarly, dudes!
,Scooter and friends:, All right, yeah! Woohoo! ,[Scooter and friends run off as an elderly couple come up],
,Elderly Man:, Lifeguard, can you point out the snack bar?
,Larry:, Right over there. But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
,Elderly Woman:, ,[both walk off], So polite.
,Elderly Man:, Just like we raised him.
,SpongeBob:, What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard. ,[imagines himself in a lifeguard watchtower], That would be so cool.
,Patrick:, Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys. ,[Larry is being carried by a bunch of fish], Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies! ,[a fish walks up seeing Patrick's expanded belly],
,Nat:, Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here. ,[Patrick pushes his belly fat into his feet],
,Patrick:, I'm going to the snack bar. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool. ,[zooms into a geek-like looking SpongeBob], I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by... ,[thunder roars], ...a flying ice cream truck. ,[ice cream truck with wings comes falling down], And live! ,[ice cream truck slows down and lands on top of SpongeBob, then drives away. SpongeBob's towel flies away],
,Larry:, ,[speaking into a megaphone], Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers. ,[As SpongeBob gets up, a vanilla ice cream cone falls off his nose], SpongeBob, you okay? ,[Larry notices the vanilla on SpongeBob's nose and mistakes it for sunscreen], Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.
,SpongeBob:, Lifeguard?
,Larry:, The nose.
,SpongeBob:, ,[swipes his finger on his nose to see the ice cream], White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?
,Larry:, Sure, there’s no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.
,SpongeBob:, You really think so?
,Larry:, You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?
,SpongeBob:, (high voice) I'd love it! ,[hugs Larry],
,Larry:, Alright. ,[puts SpongeBob down], Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here. ,[fish walks over], I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hi. ,[Annette kicks sand in his face],
,Larry:, Hey, guy's a lifeguard. ,[Annette whistles as Nat, Shubie and Bill run over and pick up SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, It works. ,[Larry and SpongeBob walk around the beach blowing their whistles. Later, SpongeBob has a suit like Larry's. Larry is now putting lotion on Sadie and gives SpongeBob a thumbs-up. SpongeBob is putting lotion on an elderly male fish. Larry and SpongeBob make sand castles. Larry lifts some weights as SpongeBob lifts two soda cups with straws for weights, a male fish walks up and takes a cup, SpongeBob falls over on one side. Both hula dance playing ukuleles], Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry.
,Larry:, Yeah. Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?
,SpongeBob:, By myself?
,Larry:, Only if you think you're ready. ,[SpongeBob holds up a jar of zinc-oxide],
,SpongeBob:, I'm not just ready. ,[puts some of the zinc-oxide on his nose], I'm ready, Freddie.
,Larry:, It's Larry. Well, I guess I'll just...
,Fish #2:, Help, help! ,[a fish struggles in the water], Help, help, help!
,Larry:, We've got a sinker! SpongeBob, let me take this. I haven't seen any action all day.
,SpongeBob:, Action?
,[Larry runs across the beach and dives into the water.],
,Fish #2:, Please help, please help! ,[Begins to sink underwater. Larry dives in after him and brings him to shore.],
,Larry:, Breathe, darn you! ,[starts to punch the fish in the stomach. The fish regurgitates water and a book],
,Fish #3:, That's the last time I read and swim! You saved my life!
,Larry:, Don't mention it. It's all part of the job. ,[Larry walks up to SpongeBob, who is stunned], You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people... ,[notice a sign that reads ""Annual Hot Dog Chug"" and everyone is rooting for Scooter, who is eating a bunch of hot dogs], ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about. ,[a boat drives up], Their lives are in your hands now, ‘cause I got a date with the tanning booth. ,[Larry jumps in the boat with Nancy, Pilar, and Shubie], See ya. ,[the boat drives off],
,SpongeBob:, But I... ,[an inner tube inflates around him], ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes. ,[throws the inner tube off], Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen? ,[imagines everyone in the lake turns into tombstones. He screams, runs up to the lifeguard tower and rings the bell, then speaks into a megaphone], Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water! ,[the entire crowd runs out of the water], Emergency! ,[everyone wonders what is going on], Uhh... there are sharks in there! ,[a family of sharks is shown in the crowd],
,Father Shark:, Hey, that's my family you're talking about!
,SpongeBob:, Uhh... sea monster! ,[a giant, green sea monster walks over],
,Sea Monster:, You know, we sea monsters have made great strides in the fields of science and literature. ,[walks off as he smacks SpongeBob with his tail],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, somebody went? ,[crowd of people are angry and go back to playing in the water], No, don't go! ,[SpongeBob gasps when he sees people in the water doing things that are ""dangerous."" He screams and then brings out an ice cream cart], Free ice cream! ,[everyone runs out of the water again and crowds around the cart], Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one? ,[everyone in the crowd eats their ice cream and sweet treats], A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming. ,[shows a clock], But just so you're not tempted... ,[ties everyone up with yellow ""do not cross"" tape], Ladies and gentlemen, uh, the lagoon is closed.
,Scooter:, We like Larry better.
,SpongeBob:, Does Larry ever give you ,[speaks into megaphone], free ice cream? ,[Patrick bursts out of a port-o-potty],
,Patrick:, Ice cream? ,[starts running around], Did somebody say ice cream? ,[runs up to the tape], Where is it? Is it here? ,[the words ""do not cross"" on the tape change into saying ""ice cream""], Huh? Ice cream, yay! ,[breaks through the tape and runs into the middle of the lagoon. After he stops, he gets an ache in his rear-end], Cramp! ,[begins to struggle in the water],
,Fish #4:, ,[notices Patrick struggling in the water], Holy cow, somebody's drowning!
,SpongeBob:, ,[lounging at the top of the lifeguard tower], Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed. ,[tied up group of fish walk over to the tower],
,Scooter:, Dude, get your butt in the water!
,SpongeBob:, If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them.
,Patrick:, Help, help! ,[SpongeBob stands up and takes off his shades], I can't swim!
,SpongeBob:, Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning.
,Patrick:, I'm drowning! I'm drowning!
,SpongeBob:,  They would have to have crossed the line.
,Patrick:, I'm drowning ‘cause I crossed the line! ,[SpongeBob takes out a pair of binoculars],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that... ,[SpongeBob's eyes become huge and break through the lenses of the binoculars], ...Patrick isn't drowning!
,Patrick:, Can't swim! Butt hurts! Ice cream! ,[SpongeBob jumps off the tower],
,SpongeBob:, Hold on, Patrick! ,[runs to the shore, flailing his arms rapidly], I'm coming!
,Patrick:, Help, help!
,SpongeBob:, Don't move! ,[gets a life preserver], Catch this! ,[throws it out to Patrick, but only lands about a foot out into the water],
,Harold:, Quit fooling around, man. Get in the water.
,Patrick:, Help, help!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think. ,[starts running in circles], Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think. ,[the shape of his body turns into a light-bulb], I've got it! ,[takes out a straw], Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water. ,[sets straw in water and starts to suck out all the water, he grows huge], Well, you're safe now, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[inside SpongeBob], Help, I'm drowning! I've got butt cramps! I want ice cream and now it’s dark! ,[SpongeBob spits all the water out. Patrick is drowning again], Help, help! Help me, I'm drowning! Help! ,[SpongeBob runs to a couple sitting in a boat, about to share a hot dog],
,Gus:, To us. ,[SpongeBob takes the boat from under the couple and runs off, then comes back],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry. Here's your hot dog. ,[hands them back their hot dog, then runs off and paddles the boat in the lagoon over to Patrick], Okay, Patrick, here I come. ,[Patrick is still flailing and screaming], Come, come round, Pat. Here I am. ,[Patrick grabs the boat and starts tearing it apart in a desperate frenzy. SpongeBob ushers him to stop, but the boat is torn completely into pieces and SpongeBob is in the water, too],
,Patrick:, Oh, sorry. ,[Both him and SpongeBob start struggling in the water, Patrick pushes SpongeBob underwater trying to stay afloat. Then he starts hitting SpongeBob with an anchor],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Help! Help us! We're drowning! ,[everyone who is tied up walks off whistling],
,SpongeBob:, Goodbye, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Goodbye, ice cream! ,[the two continue to struggle, Larry walks up behind them and picks them up, revealing that the water is very shallow, and only up to his ankles],
,Larry:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Larry?
,Larry:, You're not a lifeguard, are you?
,SpongeBob:, No, Larry.
,Larry:, ,[carrying SpongeBob and Patrick in his hands], Let's go, guys. ,[later, SpongeBob and Patrick are paddling in a kiddie pool], Very good. You fellas are learning fast.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Ow! Butt cramps!
,Patrick:, And I still don't have my ice cream.
,SpongeBob:, My sentiments exactly, Patrick.

,Squidward:, ,[holding leg in pain; moans], What kind of unforeseen yet completely predictable stupidity have you ruined my day with this time?
,SpongeBob:, Oh. I'm just practicing my ,[chops with hand], karate chops. I'm going to have ,[takes off karate glove], an intense karate session with Sandy later. Sandy says you never know what creepy creeper could be creeping creepingly around any creepy corner.

,SpongeBob:, Okey dokey, Squidward! Stop on by later if you change your mind about the karate.
,Squidward:, ,[pushes SpongeBob], I won't. ,[walks out of the Krusty Krab and scene changes to him walking in town with groceries. He then walks down a dark alley then turns around noticing something], Uh... hello? Is somebody there? ,[spots a large figure in the distance], Um... hello? It's considered rude not to answer! ,[the figure walks closer to him. He starts to act nervous], Hah... whatta ya got? Cotton in your earholes? ,[laughs nervously as the figure gets even closer to him], I gotta get outta here! ,[starts to run away, walks face-first into a low ladder, then falls on the ground and drops the groceries.

,Squidward:, That's it!? THAT'S the ""totality"" of your karate mastery?
,SpongeBob Half 1:, Well, Squidward. I've only been studying a couple of years. But if total karate knowledge is what you seek...

,Sandy:, Okay then! Let's get started with a little choppin'! Like so. HIYAH! ,[karate chops the board in half, and SpongeBob as well],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa!
,Squidward:, A board? I wasn't attacked by a piece of wood! I was assaulted by a deranged lunatic!
,Sandy:, The only way to protect yourself is if you know the basics. Now give it a chop!
,Squidward:, Sigh...whatever you say Sensei...
,SpongeBob:, This is a tough one Squidward. Don't feel bad if you can't do it.
,Squidward:, I'm sure I can break one little twig! Hiiii-YAH! ,[karate chops the board but it doesn't break. the force makes him shake and moves back on the treedome wall and he breaks apart on the ground],
,[karate chop transition to Sandy],
,Sandy:, Arms up Squidward! Block! Block! ,[Squidward gets hit by acorns thrown by SpongeBob], Block! Block!
,Squidward:, Arg! This is stupid! The only thing this maniac threw at me were his big, meaty fists! ,[raises his hands up but SpongeBob continues to throw acorns at him. Then he throws a acorn at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[blocks the acorn with his elbow], Block!
,Sandy:, Now that's how you do it!
,Squidward:, Dimwits luck! ,[gets hit by another acorn],
,[karate chop transition to the tree of them near a sandbag],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Squiddy! Give it the ol' roundhouse!
,Squidward:, Alright... ,[moves backwards], Hiyah! ,[kicks the sandbag but gets stuck to it and starts to get smacked over and over and is thrown in front of Sandy], This isn't working! ,[walks back toward the sandbag], My assailant was twice as tall! And shoulders were twenty times as broad! The burrows of his brow with the size as biceps!
,Sandy:, Hmm... we're gotta make this more personal for you Squidward. So is to help you bring out your inner dragon! SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps in wearing a ski mask], Hey! Grocery boy! It is me! A big, scary miscreant! Now hand over that sack of groceries before things get ugly!
,Squidward:, Groceries? You'll have to pull my groceries from my cold, wet tentacles bucko! Take this! Hiyah! ,[tries to karate chop SpongeBob but his arm gets stuck to his helmet], Huh? Think that's going to stop me!? You're not getting me without a fight! HIYAH! ,[tries to kick SpongeBob but his feet retract and get stuck to his helmet as well. He starts moving around on the ground getting more and more tangled], Got you... right where...I want you! ,[moves around again becoming fully tangled], Vengeance... is... MINE!
,Sandy:, Vengeance? Squidward Tentacles, I told ya at the beginning that karate ain't for revenge! Sorry Squidward. As of now, I ain't your sensei no more! ,[walks off],
,Squidward:, Sandy! Wait! ,[tries to move], I need you to teach... ,[Sighs],... this is pointless. ,[struggles], I'll never be able to protect myself. ,[struggles], I may as well start handing my groceries to criminals. Here! Please Mr. Criminal! ,[struggles], Take my unprocessed kale cream.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! Wait! Please! Help him! He just want to keep his organic, blue algae safe.
,Sandy:, He's going to use my teachings for revenge SpongeBob.
,Squidward:, Please Sandy! I'll do anything!
,Sandy:, Oh really? Well Squidward, a wise sensei once told me: ,[takes out a mop], ""One must first know the movements of everyday, to master ka-rah-tay!
,[karate chop transition to a short montage with Squidward first mopping in Sandy's house. He then tries to turn on a vacuum but doesn't turn on. He kicks it and it finally turns on and starts to clean up making the place spotless],
,Squidward:, Phew! All finished!
,Sandy:, Wow! It looks great!
,SpongeBob:, [to Squidward] ,Psst! You missed a spot!,
,[Squidward growls and a karate transition to him with water hoses tied to him spraying the grass],
,Sandy:, Alright! I reckon that yard is good and watered!
,SpongeBob:, Psst! You missed a spot!
,[Squidward mumbles angrily as a karate chop transition to him shoveling the ground],
,Squidward:, Shut up! Phew! ,[grabs the bucket of acorns and pours them into the hole he dug up],
,Sandy:, Atta boy Squiddy! ,[On a beach chair next to SpongeBob], Be sure to twist that torso!
,SpongeBob:, Hey Sandy? ,[stretches], I don't remember this being a part of my training.
,Sandy:, It wasn't! But today is chore day! So I'd figured why not fry two fish in one skillet! ,[she and SpongeBob laugh],
,Squidward:, That's it! I am outta here! This is a no good waste of my time! ,[rams his foot onto a bucket of acorns and they start to fly toward him. He blocks them all away], Hey! I'm doing it! I'm blocking the acorns!
,Sandy:, Ye-HAAA! I told y'all had to do is know the movements of everyday to master karate!
,Squidward:, Hah hah! I can't believe I did it!
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding a wooden board], YEAH YEAH! Now try this!
,Squidward:, Okay! Okay! Hee-YAH! ,[chops the wooden board and SpongeBob in half] ,Hah hah hah! Oh, I did it! ,[starts running then jumps], Hee-YAH! ,[kicks the Slug Buddy punching bag destroying it], I can protect my groceries now! Hee-YAH! ,[kicks SpongeBob toward the glass wall and breaks him apart. SpongeBob holds a thumbs up], I am a karate master! WOO HOO HOO!
,Sandy:, Well, I wouldn't go that far. But you have proven yourself worthy of... ,[takes out a belt], ...the Belt of Basic Competence!
,Squidward:, Yeah yeah, that's great, thanks. But I have some business to attend to! ,[walks off, ,and a karate chop transition to him walking down a dark alley], Heh heh heh... What's this? Do I find myself on this dark and scary street, yet again? We'll just see what happens! ,[walks down further into the alley], This time!
,Man:, Hey! You! ,[starts walking toward Squidward],
,Squidward:, Let me give him a taste! A mere morsel of what's in store! ,[karate chops], Hee-YAH! ,[kicks], HEE-YAH! ,[flips], Hiyah! That one was called Washing Sandy's Windows! ,[the man walks closer], Stay back or you're gonna get it! I am warning you! ,[the man continues to walk closer breathing heavily], Okay buddy, I warned ya! ,[near a trash can], I like to call this one Taking Out Sandy's Trash! Hee-YAH! ,[kicks the trash can toward the man],
,Man:, What? ,[gets hit on the head by the trash can], OW!
,Squidward:, Hah! Hah! How do you like them apples? YAH! ,[punches a crate at the man],
,Man:, Ow! OW!
,Squidward:, ,[holding two wooden planks], Hah! Feel my wrath! ,[throws them], How's your uncle!
,Man:, ,[gets hit on the head by one of the planks], Ow! ,[the other hits him on the stomach], Ow!
,Squidward:, My finishing move! I give you Watering Sandy's Lawn! Hee-YAH! ,[spin kicks a dumpster at the man. Then pushes it off of him],
,Man:, Oh...hey, man! Wha-what was that for? ,[holding Squidward's groceries], I was just trying to give you back your groceries you dropped!
,Squidward:, ,[takes the groceries], Uh, oh. 
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! I found him! He's over here! ,[holding the belt], You forgot your belt silly! ,[looks at the man and gasps],
,Sandy:, Gosh! What happened to you?
,SpongeBob:, This guy's been... ka-rah-tayed!
,Sandy:, After all I'd said about never using karate for revenge?
,SpongeBob:, For shame, Squidward. For shame.
,Sandy:, Looks like he's not worthy of this belt after all. ,[takes the belt], Thanks for dishonoring our trust in you Squidward. ,[walks off with SpongeBob],.
,Squidward:, Whatever! I'm still a karate master!
,Officer John:, Wow, really? You are? ,[walks Squidward to the police car],
,Squidward:, Yes I am!
,Officer John:, Hey watch your head. ,[Squidward gets into the police car. Then John gets into it], Oh, I never guess it.
,Squidward:, And what is that suppose to mean?
,Officer John:, Oh, uh nothing. Just with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in the midsection...
,Squidward:, Okay already! I get it! ,[notices the hand cuffs on him], What? Wait a second. Am I under arrest?
,Officer John:, You sure are! And you have the right to remain silent... ,[Squidward screams loudly], ...or not silent. ,[drives off, and the episode ends],

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Squidward is playing his clarinet very poorly and is driving the customers crazy.],
,Harold:, ,[pulls out his eyeballs and plugs his ears], Ah.
,Nat Peterson:, Make it stop! Ah! ,[crashes into a pole],
,[Mr. Krabs exits his office and hears the horrible music Squidward's playing.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh. ,[sprays pest spray on the sour notes and groans], Mister Squidward! Quit that calamitous cacophony! You're driving me customers batty!
,[Tom growls and crushes his drink in anger.],
,Squidward:, ,[pulls his clarinet out of his mouth], Well, I'm sorry you rubes can't enjoy jazz. I am practicing for a very important open mic night tonight.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, practice somewhere else! This here's a jazz-free zone! ,[slaps Squidward hard, then holds his head to a ""no jazz"" sign],
,[An eel customer sobs and walks out after being offended by the ""no jazz"" sign. Mr. Krabs lets go of Squidward and his head spins around.],
,Squidward:, ,[jibbers], Fine! I'll take my music to the other people then. ,[shoves his hat on Mr. Krabs' head],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pokes his eyes out through the hat], And if I see that clarinet again, it'll be going into the woodwind chipper! You hear me?
,[Squidward grumbles as he leaves the Krusty Krab. Squidward walks up to the ""Near Mint Comic Books"" store where Bubble Bass is talking to his friends.],
,Bubble Bass:, As you can see, this is the first generation Talking Suburban Dad figurine, with realistic burger-flipping motion.
,Suburban Dad Toy:, Not right now, Billy. Daddy's had a long day.
,Bubble Bass' friends:, Ooh.
,[Suddenly, their moment was interrupted when Squidward's sour music annoys them. It also makes Bubble Bass drop his action figure and it breaks its arm.],
,Bubble Bass:, Suburban Dad! No! ,[walks out and sees Squidward], You? ,[jumps up and slams on Squidward; Squidward crawls comes out injured], You—will remove that subpar woodwind from the premises, ere I smash its reed!
,[Squidward pulls himself out of Bubble Bass and rolls back home. He crashes at his door, with his clarinet pierced through the door. Squidward falls down to the ground and pulls his clarinet from the door.],
,Squidward:, Can't practice anywhere in this town. ,[slams the door], Bunch of tasteless clowns! ,[grumbles and plays his clarinet outside his house's window],
,Patrick:, ,[playing with rocks], Smashy, smashy! Bang, bang! Sma–oh! ,[covers his ears], Ow! What is that noise? ,[looks up and sees Squidward playing his clarinet], Oh, no. Squidward's being attacked by that pointy screeching monster. Don't worry, Squidward! I'll save you! ,[throws a rock],
,Squidward:, ,[stops playing], What are you– ,[gets hit by the rock and crashes inside his house; appears without a head], Hm? Uh? Hm? ,[his head is pinned to the mantelpiece and his clarinet has a rock lodged in its mouth], Oh!
,Patrick:, You're welcome!
,[The scene changes to Squidward about to put his clarinet on a pillow while he prepares to take a little nap.],
,Squidward:, ,[humming], It's time for our pre-performance nap. Tonight, we change lives with our music. ,[kisses his clarinet, puts it on a pillow and leaves to take a nap],
,French Narrator:, One nap later...
,Squidward:, ,[appears in a suit], Are you ready, my dear? We've got the– ,[gasps and screams],
,[His entire living room has been damaged and his clarinet was stolen. The episode's  background color turns into black and white.],
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], And that's how it began. My life smashed to bits. My living room covered in broken dreams. Without my clarinet, the world was a drab and colorless place. ,[picks up the pillow and hears SpongeBob giggling outside], And that's when I saw him, my first suspect. ,[SpongeBob is playing in the puddles], When it comes to paying the stupid bill, SpongeBob always tipped 20%. ,[SpongeBob puts sand in his head and drains it out of his holes], He had to be involved. ,[walks over to SpongeBob], SpongeBob, what have you done with my clarinet?
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, Squidward, you're so hard-boiled. Are you playing a game? Oh, oh, can I play?
,Squidward:, I know you stole my clarinet! Tell me ,[slaps him], where! ,[slaps him again], It! ,[slaps him again], Is!
,SpongeBob:, ,[slaps himself], I ,[slaps himself again], Don't! ,[slaps himself again], Know! ,[giggles], It couldn't have been me, Squidward. I have an alibi. I was at Grandma's house all day and I have the kissy marks to prove it, ,[points to the kissy marks on his head], see? There's room for one more.
,[Squidward is grossed out and he pushes SpongeBob away.],
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], His alibi was solid. Only a family member could stomach putting their lips on this fool.
,SpongeBob:, You know, we have lots of friends. Maybe they could help us find your clarinet.
,Squidward:, I don't have friends. I have suspects.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward, don't you know a suspect is just a friend you haven't cleared of charges yet? ,[gets pushes down by Squidward], So... can I help you solve your case? Please, please, please?
,Squidward:, Try not to get in the way.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! It's a play-date! I mean... ,[changes into his detective clothes], All right, I'll partner up with you this time. ,[flips a coin and it disappears], Huh?
,[The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob driving in the streets as rain pours down.],
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], My... ,[clears throat], partner and I decided to check out my next suspect, the owner of a local greasy spoon. I figured a little ""Good cop, bad cop"" would get his jaw flapping so I–
,SpongeBob:, ,[narrating], Oh! Can I be the bad cop? Please, please, can I, please?
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], Yes, if you get out of my hard-boiled narration!
,SpongeBob:, ,[narrating], Sorry. ,[flips coin],
,[They drive up to the Krusty Krab. They walk up to the front doors. SpongeBob flips a coin and the coin disappears.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh? ,[gets pulled into the restaurant by Squidward],
,[Mr. Krabs is in his office playing with his money.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What the–
,[Squidward comes in and kicks away the desk.],
,Squidward:, Hey, Mister Krabs, how are you doing? Can I get you some tea? Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? ,[gives Mr. Krabs a cup of tea and he sips it], Now, where were you earlier–
,SpongeBob:, You seem hungry, dear. Home-cooked meal? ,[gives Mr. Krabs a microwavable meal],
,Squidward:, What are you doing, SpongeBob? ,[clears throat and pulls out a nail filer], Manicure?
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[gets his claw filed by Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, ,[pulls in a makeover], Makeover? ,[puts Mr. Krabs in the makeover machine, and out comes Mr. Krabs with a long, blonde wig. SpongeBob sprays him with ""Make Up in a Can"" afterward],
,Squidward:, Warm blanket? ,[puts the blanket onto Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, New shoes? ,[pushes Squidward],
,Squidward:, Hey!
,[SpongeBob puts shoes on Mr. Krabs' feet.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[rips the blanket], Enough!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, check out the dame.
,[Mr. Krabs now appears as a woman. Squidward is grossed out at the appearance and nearly throws up.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What in the salty seven seas are you two doing?!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, we're playing ""Good cop, good cop."" Sorry, Squidward, I don't know how to be the bad cop!
,Squidward:, ,[grabs and pulls down a hanging lamp over Mr. Krabs], We're looking for my clarinet, Eugene. I know you broke into my house this afternoon! I know you stole it! Now fess up!
,Mr. Krabs:, This afternoon? Well, I was–I've been here all day, counting me money! Just look at me butt groove! ,[points to his chair with butt grooves],
,SpongeBob:, ,[rubs his finger onto the butt groove], Good contours. ,[pushes on the seat], And still warm. Story checks out. ,[sniffs his finger, but notices it is extremely smelly],
,Squidward:, All right, Mr. Krabs, we'll mosey along this time. ,[leaves], Come on, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Mm, hmm. ,[leaves as his eyes extend; he pulls them back],
,Mr. Krabs:, Boys, if you two do find that clarinet, could you bring it to me? So I can smash it to pieces!
,[The scene changes Squidward and SpongeBob pulling up to the ""Near Mint Comic Books"" store to ask their next suspect.],
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], We pulled up to the local dweeb market, where I hoped to find my next suspect: maven of all things moronic, Bubble Bass. The sign said closed, but I could hear their nerdy murmuring inside.
,[Bubble Bass is playing a board game with his friends inside the store.],
,Bubble Bass:, And then, from the depths of the barbeque, comes the ferocious, fire-breathing ,[pulls out his suburban dad action figure], Dad!
,Squidward:, ,[kicks the door], Bubble Bass! ,[his foot cramps up], Ow!
,Bubble Bass:, Huh? ,[runs away],
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops Squidward from chasing Bubble Bass], Squidward, wait! ,[pulls out his Mermaid Man action figure], Let him handle this.
,[The scene becomes an imaginary action show where SpongeBob's Mermaid Man action figure chases Bubble Bass's Suburban Dad action figure. They climb up the book shelves, knocking over several comics.],
,Suburban Dad:, ,[throws actions figures], Take that! And that! ,[Mermaid Man punches them away], What? ,[he gets corned to the edge], All right. You've got me cornered. But I won't give up without a fight!
,Mermaid Man:, I was hoping you'd say that.
,[Mermaid Man and Suburban Dad go head to head with one another.],
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], It was a real knockdown, drag-out fight. Or it would've been, if it hadn't been just two sad adults playing with toys.
,Bubble Bass:, Wait. Wait! Roll the dice. Did his punch land?
,Bubble Bass' friend:, ,[rolls the dice], It's a hit!
,[Mermaid Man punches Suburban Dad. Suburban Dad falls but is grabbed by Mermaid Man.],
,Suburban Dad:, Huh? Oh. ,[exhales],
,SpongeBob:, Where were you this afternoon? Where's Squidward's clarinet?
,Bubble Bass:, I don't know what you're talking about. I was here all day. I swear it!
,[Mermaid Man loses his grip and the Suburban Dad action figure falls and breaks into pieces.],
,Suburban Dad:, Billy, don't make me turn this boat around.
,Bubble Bass:, No! I still could have passed you off as near mint! ,[sobbing],
,Bubble Bass' friends:, ,[walk up to comfort Bubble Bass], Aww. So, sorry, man.
,SpongeBob:, I am so sorry for your loss.
,Squidward:, I'm not. Come on, SpongeBob, let's go. This is a dead end. ,[leaves with SpongeBob],
,[The scene changes to Squidward's house.],
,Squidward:, ,[walk in and wrings out his hat], Well, there's only one more person on my list of suspects.
,SpongeBob:, ,[flips a coin], Patrick Star?
,Squidward:, Um, yeah, how'd you know?
,[SpongeBob points to Patrick, who is eating some goo at the crime scene of where the Squidward's clarinet was taken.],
,Patrick:, Hey, guys!
,Squidward:, Well, the criminal returns to the scene of the crime. Spill the beans, Jack! Where's my clarinet?
,Patrick:, I don't know who Jack is! But I would like some beans!
,Squidward:, Let me lay it out for you, Chucko. When I took my nap today, you broke in through the window, smashed my living room, got that goo you're eating all over and stole my clarinet!
,Patrick:, Oh, this isn't goo. It's jelly! The good stuff too, from real jellyfish. ,[eats some jelly],
,SpongeBob:, ,[flips coin], Real jellyfish jelly? You can only find that in one place. That means our thief...
,Squidward:, Must have been at Jellyfish Fields! Let's go!
,SpongeBob:, Right behind you, pal. ,[flips coin and it disappears], Huh? ,[gets dragged away by Patrick], Whoa!
,[The scene changes to Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick driving to Jellyfish Fields.],
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], When we arrived at Jellyfish Fields, I could already hear my clarinet's dulcet tones.
,[Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick pull over, step out of the car and see a giant hive in the middle of the fields. It is revealed that the culprit who stole Squidward's clarinet is a group of jellyfish who are blowing through it to make music.],
,Squidward:, My baby! ,[grabs the clarinet from the jellyfish], Ha!
,[The episode turns its color back on.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! So it was the jellyfish that took your clarinet. But from the sound of it, I'd say they've learned that crime doesn't play! ,[giggles and Patrick slaps him],
,[Squidward plays music with his clarinet.],
,SpongeBob:, Look, Squidward. The jellyfish are fans of your music.
,Patrick:, We should solve another mystery now.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, uh, how about the mystery of where all my coins went? ,[flips a coin and it disappears], Huh? ,[coins fall on him],
,Patrick:, Solved!
,[The scene changes to nighttime. The hive is now a nightclub where jellyfish can dine and watch the show.],
,Jellyfish:, ,[a jellyfish bouncer allows the jellyfish to enter], Thank you.
,[The jellyfish sit back and watch Squidward play his clarinet on stage. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick watch the show while wearing earplugs.],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, yeah! Yeah, Squidward! ,[whistles],
,[Mr. Krabs curls his hair and Patrick eats a bowl of jellyfish jelly.],
,Squidward:, ,[narrating], And that's how it ended. Clarinet returned. Case closed. Another mystery solved by: Squidward Tentacles, Jazz Detective.

,Paremedic:, That should do it, Mr. Krabs. You'll be good as new in no time.

,Mr. Krabs:, Stop! Stop here!
,[Mr. Krabs peeks out the window and sees a line of customers lining up at SpongeBob's Place. A couple is having a picnic while Bubble Bass walks by with a plateful of patties.

,Mr. Krabs:, Make a hole!
,[Mr. Krabs enters SpongeBob's Place and walks by several customers including Larry the Lobster. Before he enters the kitchen, Gary comes out with a plateful of patties.],

,SpongeBob:, Oh, hello, Mr. Krabs. Place your order with Gary, please. And drop your money anywhere. I'm running out of places to put it. I really don't have time to count it.
,[Mr. Krabs opens the fridge and sees money in it. He is shocked. Then he goes to SpongeBob's room and sees money everywhere . He goes to his bathroom and sees money in the toilet.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts salt on the patty], Here, try one.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sadly takes a bite of the patty], Oh, it's delicious.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, I ran out of napkins. You'll have to use a $100 bill. ,[gives Mr. Krabs a $100 bill],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[depressed], You deserve your own place. ,[blows his nose through the dollar and stuffs it in his pocket],
,[Mr. Krabs sulks out of SpongeBob's Place.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, don't go! I need you!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, what do you need me for? You got everything: a magic touch for cooking, lots of customers, money!
,SpongeBob:, I could use a boss. Someone to take all the credit and all the money.
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? Hmmm. Well, I suppose I could do some bossing. How's a 99% for me and 1% for you?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's more than generous!
,French Narrator:, The next morning...
,[Squidward walks up to the Krusty Krab, sighs as he cuts the caution tape, and enters the restaurant. He turns on the lights and sees the place a complete mess.],

,Andy Yellowtail:, Ahem.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[wakes up], Huh?
,Andy Yellowtail:, Are you the owner of this food establishment?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I do own 99% of SpongeBob's Place so I guess that's a yes. But you'll have to stand in line if you want to place an order!
,Andy Yellowtail:, Yeah, well, I have an order for you. ,[holds out paper], An order to shut down your restaurant. It's against city health codes to sell food in a pineapple.
,Carl:, ,[munches on patty], Say, Andy, you gotta try these patties. They're delicious.
,Andy Yellowtail:, ,[smacks patty out of Carl's hand], Carl, you're eating contraband.
,Carl:, You're not the boss of me.
,Andy Yellowtail:, Uh, yeah! I totally am the boss of you!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what's going on?
,Mr. Krabs:, We've been shut down.
,SpongeBob:, Well, it was ,bun, while it lasted! ,[laughs as he bumps Gary back to his normal face],
,Gary:, Meow!
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, I know of an empty restaurant that's got all its papers in order. We can move in right away.
,SpongeBob:, Did you get rid of the ghost?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, the ghost is gone.

,Squidward:, ♪I hate people! I'm still that way! La, la, la, la, la, la, hey, hey, hey!♪
,SpongeBob:, Sounds like it's still haunted.

,Squidward:, ♪I hate SpongeBob! I hate Krabs! I wish they would leave the ocean in taxi cabs! And all the customers can kiss my abs! 'Cause I'm the one and only—♪
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[turns on the lights], Mr. Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[gulps], And...uh...oh...
,[Squidward turns and sees the customers, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs, who is staring angrily at him. The customers laugh at Squidward just as he nervously shrivels down and pops. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walking out of the restaurant.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, I've been doing some thinking. You're a big part of this place, boy-o, and I believe I should share the name with you. ,[turns SpongeBob to the sign], Take a gander.
,SpongeBob:, I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. It looks the same.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pushes SpongeBob], Well, climb up there! Get a closer look.
,[SpongeBob climbs to the top of the sign.],
,SpongeBob:, Where?

,Patrick:, You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, yes, how did you guess?
,Patrick:, Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself.

,Patrick:, So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single species of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?
,SpongeBob:, Well, yeah, that's a simplified version, but yeah, something like that, ,[angrily takes off goggles], which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, ""Shelly Super Highway,"" from ever being built!

,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields. ,[sniffles],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?
,SpongeBob:, Really, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure, why not?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[puzzled], Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, why?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gibberish, possibly trying to say ""no"", while pulling on his eyeballs],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[smiling, walks over to a poster with charts and maps on it], Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see fo yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles, brushes away a tear], Charts and dia-,[eyes widen, horrified], Mr. Krabs! Didn't you see!? ,[folds out the rest of the diagram map], After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Gee, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it does a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[horrified, then furious], What!? Who approved this plan!?
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts to read off the map, while Mr. Krab's eyes widen], ""Plan approved by & sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!""

,Plankton:, I really can't come outside!

,Plankton:, Now what's this all about, anyway?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking.
,Plankton:, All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop.
,SpongeBob:, Not that!
,Mr. Krabs:, What? You've been what?
,SpongeBob:, We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait a minute. You've been what?
,Plankton:, Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know.
,Plankton:, Forget it. Even if I wanted to the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible.
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Plankton:, Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback.

,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, why did I say ""aye""?
,Plankton:, Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs now walk towards the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, What are we gonna do now, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds: lie on me back and sob loudly.
,SpongeBob:, Normally, Mr. Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up! There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!

,Pizza Pete:, ,[from the background], Pst! ,[shows him in the shadow], Hey, kid. You need help out of here? ,[Leans out of the shadow],
,SpongeBob:, Pizza Pete! Yes, please. That wiener has me chained to the grill, ,[Pizza Pete approaches him], and he really seems to be relishing it.
,Pizza Pete:, I have something to free you. ,[Takes pizza sauce out],
,SpongeBob:, Pizza sauce? ,[Pizza Pete puts the pizza sauce on both handcuffs], I'm free!
,Pizza Pete:, Great! Now you can get to my grill. ,[Takes bread stick out],
,SpongeBob:, What? ,[Pizza Pete ties his hands with the breadstick], Parmesan-crusted breadstick! ,[Pizza Pete takes him], Whoa!
,Mr. Weiner:, ,[from the kitchen door], Hey! Where are you going with my fry cook?
,[Cuts SpongeBob being carried by Pizza Pete and screaming],
,Noodleman:, ,[takes SpongeBob with chopsticks and laughs while being on the roof], I'll take one fry-cook to go! ,[He jumps off the roof and laughs again after landing. Señor Taco opens the door next to him and sends him away],
,SpongeBob:, ,[lands], Oh, thank you, Señor Taco! ,[Señor Taco grabs him with his suit], Oh, no! Not you too! ,[He screams while Señor Taco carries him],
,Pizza Pete, Mr. Weiner and Noodleman:, ,[Señor Taco runs into them], Get him! ,[They jump on Señor Taco],
,[Fight starts and smoke covers the screen that soon disappears to show all four of them stretching SpongeBob by pulling each of his limbs],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa!
,Noodleman:, Let go!
,Mr. Weiner:, He's mine!
,Senor Taco:, I was here first!
,Pizza Pete:, No, I was!
,[Scene expands to show someone in a Krabby Patty costume on the roof.],
,Krabby Patty Man:, Stop! Unhand that sponge! ,[Jumps on Pizza Pete and punches him away. Takes Señor Taco and destroys his costume by gobbling it. Señor Taco runs away embarrassed.],
,Noodleman:, ,[drops SpongeBob], It's the Killer Patty! ,[Gets noodles squeezed out of his costume by Krabby Patty Man],
,Mr. Weiner:, ,[Krabby Patty Man walks towards him and he drops SpongeBob before he gets to him], Here, take him! Just don't hurt me. ,[Whimpers with eyes closed. Opens eyes to see that Krabby Patty Man is gone and sighs. Starts humming while crossing the street and is hit by a bus], Aah!
,[The scene changes to show SpongeBob waking up],
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens eyes], Krabby Patty! You saved me! ,[Krabby Patty Man starts carrying him], Well, here we go again.
,[Krabby Patty Man carries him to the Krusty Krab and walks past John, Blue Fred, and Thaddeus exiting it. Smokes comes out of the Krusty Krab when John opens the front door],
,John:, Ugh! This place is terrible!
,Blue Fred:, The Krusty Krab has really gone downhill.
,[As they get inside Krabby Patty Man puts SpongeBob down. Krusty Krab is a mess and there is smoke coming through the order window],
,Nat Peterson:, ,[holding burned Krabby Patty], How can you serve this slop? ,[Throws it on the floor], I'm never eating here again! ,[Leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[holding spatula in his hand and exiting the kitchen with one burnt eyebrow.], Wait! Come back! ,[Drops spatula], That was me last customer. ,[SpongeBob and Krabby Patty Man approach], SpongeBob? ,[Takes SpongeBob and lifts him.], Squidward, you found him!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[takes Krabby Patty costume off], I'm afraid so. ,[Kicks costume and leans hand towards SpongeBob], SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Squidward?
,Squidward:, You know I hate you, right?
,SpongeBob:, Yes. ,[Smiles and takes Squidward's ""arm"" tentacle], Yes, I do.
,Squidward:, Well, I hate the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more. ,[Gets on his knee and takes SpongeBob's hands], Please come back and be the fry cook again. ,[Lets SpongeBob hands go],
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns to Mr. Krabs], Well, if it's okay with you, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, laddy. ,[Takes SpongeBob], I shoulda never let you go. The Krusty Krab has fallen apart without you. You're rehired, boy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns to Squidward who is still on knees], All right! Now my life has purpose again! ,[Turns away], Let's get this place cleaned up. ,[Jumps on the beam where bucket and mop are prepared and his hat already tied to the rope. Does the victory screech, jumps of the beam and cleans everything while swinging; including giving Mr. Krabs brand new suit and Squidward a brand new pink dress and crown.],
,Squidward:, Hmm. ,[examines dress], Not exactly my color.
,SpongeBob:, ,[cuts the rope tied to his hat, flies back to the kitchen through order window, takes patty off the grill and exits through the kitchen door with the Krabby Patty on the plate.], The Krusty Krab is back in business!
,[The scene changes to show a line in front of the Krusty Krab where people are cheering. The scene changes again to inside of Krusty Krab where customers are eating; including Senor Taco, Pizza Pete, Noodleman, The Hot Dog minions, and Mr. Weiner.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, SpongeBob, it looks like things are back to normal. And to make up for that extra nickel I was losing, I installed a pay toilet. ,[Shows Old Man Jenkins holding a purse looking for a nickel for the pay toilet],
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[hopping], Oh, dear, where is that nickel? ,[Shows SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs laughing], Huh? Why are you laughing?

"[A book entitled ""The Legend of SpongeBob SquarePants"" is on a wooden type platform.],
,Narrator:, Ahoy, mateys! Today I'll be spinning a tale you won't soon forget. ,[book opens and shows a chapter called ""SpongeBob vs. The Patty Gadget""], It's called ""SpongeBob SquarePants Vs. The Patty Gadget"". Now, SpongeBob was workin', his eye on the grill, 'til he heard a sharp sound that gave him a chill.
,SpongeBob:, What's going on? What could it mean?
,Narrator:, Wow, it's a deep-fry patty cookin' machine. ,[a round, metal machine comes through the doors], And hiding behind it, who do we see? None other than Squidward and his bad face acne. ,[zoom in on Squidward's zits on his face],
,Squidward:, Hey!
,Mr. Krabs:, What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?
,Squidward:, A miracle, a marvel. It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace.
,Mr. Krabs:, But how are the patties? I mean, how do they taste?
,Squidward:, I'll let you try one. Shove this in your face. ,[hands Mr. Krabs a Krabby Patty],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[eats it], I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy. But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time.
,Squidward:, Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime.
,Mr. Krabs:, Your machine sounds delightful. But how much does it cost?
,Squidward:, Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, ""Get lost."" ,[SpongeBob is staring from the kitchen window],
,Narrator:, The machine wanted his job to make SpongeBob quit. But SpongeBob didn't like it. No, not one bit. Pushing his grill, SpongeBob burst through the door.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pushes the grill out of the kitchen], I challenge your gadget. I declare patty war!
,Narrator:, With three little words, Krabs started the show. Flag raised in the air, he cried...
,Mr. Krabs:, Ready, set, go...!
,Narrator:, Quick as a flash, Squidward pulled the big lever, and sat back and watched feeling oh, so quite clever. SpongeBob, with spatula held tight in his fist, flung twenty patties, not a single one missed. ,[SpongeBob throws twenty patties on the grill],
,The crowd was impressed.
,Sandy:, Wow!
,Narrator:, They cheered full of glee. All except Patrick, who had to go pee. ,[everyone cheers except Patrick, who is wiggling a lot],
,Narrator:, A noise and a clatter came from the machine, and out popped the patties in a burst of hot steam. The gadget was fast, its first batch completed, but SpongeBob yelled out...
,SpongeBob:, I won't be defeated!
,Narrator:, He took in some air. SpongeBob swelled his physique. And dozens of patties filled up his cheeks. ,[SpongeBob breathes in so hard that a bag of patties flies into his mouth], He strained and he sweated. He summoned his will, and shot Krabby Patties right onto the grill.
,Squidward:, Not bad!
,Narrator:, Yelled out Squidward.
,Squidward:, A really good try. But let's see how you do against my machine set on high. ,[pulls down the machine lever to set it on high],
,Narrator:, The gizmo, it shuddered. It clattered, it shook. And as Squidward laughed:
,Squidward:, Ha, ha.
,Narrator:, Sandy said...
,Sandy:, What a schnook.
,Narrator:, But SpongeBob cried out...
,SpongeBob:, I won't lose to that thing!
,Narrator:, Then he held up two spatulas and leapt like a spring. His hands were a blur, the patties went flying. He fried up a hundred without even trying. Squidward was worried. SpongeBob couldn't be beat.
,Squidward:, I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat.
,Narrator:, He struggled and strained 'til his face turned dark blue. Then the lever moved forward and broke right in two. The gadget buckled and sparked. It cracked like a gun. So Squidward took off, yelling...
,Squidward:, ,[runs out of the Krusty Krab], Let me know if I've won!
,Narrator:, Lightning flew from its maw. It looked ready to burst. But SpongeBob, still standing, yelled...
,SpongeBob:, Foul beast, do your worst!
,Narrator:, The patties came flying, by twos and by threes, by dozens, by hundreds, oh, it was something to see. Aye, that machine, it was fast, but SpongeBob was faster. He proved to that thing that he was its master. ,[patty gadget blows up], The gadget blew into bits and died with a boom. The blast was so loud, it woke King Neptune. ,[King Neptune is in his bed, asleep, with a teddy bear, until he hears the boom],
,King Neptune:, ,[mumbles], What was that? ,[cut back to the Krusty Krab],
,Narrator:, It was all over, finished and done. With his head held up high, SpongeBob knew he had won. The crowd yelled, ""Hooray, Squidward's name is now mud!"" But as they were cheering, SpongeBob fell with a thud. ,[SpongeBob falls over. He lets go of his spatula. The crowd gasps. Cut to a grave, where Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are standing in front of it. The three leave the scene, while Squidward walks up to the grave.], The service was short, tears shed with regret. Squidward, it seemed, was the one most upset. ,[Squidward cries, sets flowers over the grave, then walks away. Then, SpongeBob walks up to the grave],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo, yeah! ,[dances cheerfully],
,Narrator:, What's that? You thought SpongeBob was buried down there? They just buried the gadget. Ha-ha, this I swear. ,[pan below the dirt where we see the patty gadget underground. The storybook closes], Well, that ends me tale, straight from the book. Now I gotta go and polish me hook!

"Squidward:, ,[sighs happily], I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock. ,[notices SpongeBob standing next to his bed],
,SpongeBob:, Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward? ,[SpongeBob is spit out of the island head, into the air], Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later! ,[cuts to Squidward planting. Right before he puts in a plant, he sees SpongeBob's face in the hole], Hi, Squidward, wanna play?
,Squidward:, No, and leave me alone! ,[puts the plant in the hole, covering SpongeBob's face. Then a flower springs from the ground with SpongeBob's face on it],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward, see ya later. ,[cuts to Squidward in front of a canvas],
,Squidward:, Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create. ,[right before he begins to paint, SpongeBob's face appears on the canvas],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, wanna play? ,[Squidward paints a giant red 'NO' on the canvas], Okay, Squidward, see ya later. ,[cuts to Squidward in his library],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word. ,[Opens book and SpongeBob jumps out],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, wanna play? ,[Squidward shuts book, with SpongeBob in it, and puts it back on the shelf. Muffled], Okay, Squidward, see ya later. ,[cuts to Squidward in his bathtub while playing with his nose. He notices SpongeBob watching him from his window and screams], Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?
,Squidward:, Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first. ,[closes the curtain], Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins. ,[laughs], Defeat has never tasted so sweet. ,[phone rings], Yello? ,[SpongeBob's mouth pops through the receiver into his ear],
,SpongeBob:, How 'bout a game of hangman?
,Squidward:, How 'bout a game of hang up? ,[slams down phone], Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating. ,[as he walks out of the bathtub, he is sprayed in the face with mud. SpongeBob is drilling into his bathroom],
,SpongeBob:, How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks & Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings & Queens? Mahjong? ,[Squidward is beginning to fume and he picks up SpongeBob and shakes him angrily], Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?
,Squidward:, It's called, ""I will never play with you... ,[yells in SpongeBob’s ear], ...ever!"" ,[throws SpongeBob into the hole and moves the refrigerator over it],
,SpongeBob:, Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward... ,[jumps out of hole], I'll just make one of my own! ,[fridge falls on top of Squidward, squishing him. He squirms out from under it and sees SpongeBob running back to his house],
,Squidward:, I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the... ,[pneumatic tools whirring and grinding are heard from SpongeBob's house. Squidward walks over to his house], SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this... ,[door opens and knocks Squidward down],
,Mini Squid:, Hello, Squidward. ,[Squidward screams and hides behind a bush], Squidward! It's me, Mini Squidward!
,Squidward:, What are you doing, SpongeBob?
,Mini Squid:, Hello, Squidward.
,Squidward:, What manner of annoying scheme is this?
,SpongeBob:, Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.
,Squidward:, Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], Hello, Squidward.
,Mini Squid:, Wondrous weather we're having, eh, Squidward, old pal?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?
,Mini Squid:, SpongeBob made a replacement you: me. So when you you don't want to play, SpongeBob will play with me-you.
,Squidward:, So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?
,Mini Squid:, Yeah.
,Squidward:, Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you! ,[kisses Mini Squid then runs off laughing hysterically], Woo-hoo-hoo! ,[pole vaults through his house window. SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mini Squid sitting next to SpongeBob's pineapple playing charades],
,Mini Squid:, Three words. Movie title. ,[gasps], ""12 Angry Jellyfish.""
,SpongeBob:, How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.
,Patrick:, ,[to Mini Squid], Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?
,SpongeBob:, Actually, Patrick, this is...
,Patrick:, D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard. ,[SpongeBob and Mini Squid look at each other. Scene cuts to Squidward working at the Krusty Krab serving Krabby Patties to a couple, sounding monotone],
,Squidward:, Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty? ,[The customers are silent and look irritated], See... 'cause... they're both... krabby. ,[SpongeBob and Mini Squid walk in],
,SpongeBob:, Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?
,Mini Squid:, Of course, I am. I love to work!
,Sandals:, Who is that little fellow with SpongeBob?
,Suzy Fish:, I don't know, but isn't he handsome?
,Sandals:, Yeah, he is handsome. ,[Squidward starts mumbling], Ahem.
,Squidward:, Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
,Sandals:, No. I don't like your attitude, bub. Is this what the Krusty Krab calls friendly service? ,[Mini Squid pops up from under the cash register],
,Mini Squid:, Sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
,Sandals:, Now that's more like it. Finally, a server with a good attitude.
,Mini Squid:, Well, thank you very much.
,Sandals:, I'll take eight dozen of your finest patties, please. But don't let old chowder pants over there touch them. He might taint the patties.
,Squidward:, Fine then. Do my work for me. ,[puts his hat on Mini Squid's head and walks away],
,Squidward:, I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this.
,SpongeBob:, Order up, Mini Squid!
,Mini Squid:, Okay, SpongeBob. Always happy to help. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Here you go, pal! ,[flips six patties on Mini Squid's plate], Go get em', tiger! ,[Mini Squid walks over to the customers],
,Mini Squid:, Okay, now, who had the Krabby Patty, and who had the Krabby Patty? ,[both fish laugh],
,Squidward:, What the...? That's my joke!
,Sandals:, Wow, honey, this new Mini Squidward is such a card!
,Suzy Fish:, And a great waiter, dear.
,Sandals:, Yeah. You're right. So much better than that old, lousy, larger-scale Squidward. ,[Squidward mumbles angrily],
,Suzy Fish:, Yeah! Bring that little fella over here and let me give him a $300 dollar tip! ,[shows $300],
,Squidward:, What? All right, all right! That's enough! My break is finished. ,[walks behind cash register],
,Squidward:, Oh boy! Back to work!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold on a second, there.
,Squidward:, Oh, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this — well, not that sorry — the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks! So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately. ,[hands Squidward dirty dishes], Now pipe down and watch how it's done.
,Mini Squid:, Hey, everybody! I'm Squidward and I love to dance.
,Jimmy Gus:, I, for one, love to watch people dance while I eat. Who's with me? Who wants Mini Squidward to dance for our amusement? ,[everyone cheers],
,Mini Squid:, Well, gosh, okay. ,[SpongeBob changes Mini Squid into a purple aerobics outfit. Mini Squid starts dancing when the music starts. Some customers dance the same thing Mini Squid and SpongeBob are dancing],
,Squidward:, What's the big deal? Those are all my moves! ,[dances the same moves but no one is impressed], Ta-da!
,Fred:, ,[gasps], Talk about no talent!
,Harold:, Maybe Squidward should get sized-reduction surgery so he'll dance better! ,[everyone laughs],
,Squidward:, That Mini Squid... ,[Mini Squid continues to dance and plays the clarinet to everyone's amazement],
,Mini Squid:, Everybody dance! ,[everyone dances. Music stops and Mini Squid takes a bow],
,Squidward:, That was awful! ,[all cheer for Mini Squid and Squidward begins to fume],
,Squidward:, He stole my jokes... he stole my job... he stole my standing ovation! You little wooden fiend, STOP STEALING MY LIFE!!! ,[walks over and does bodily harm to Mini Squid before an agent shows up],
,Talent Agent:, Stop, stop! Don't gnaw on the head of my new client, please! You don't know what you're doing. Are you mad? Have mercy!
,Squidward:, Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player.
,Talent Agent:, Salutations! I'm Milo J. Finkerfish: manager for ""Curly Bubbles Records.""
,Squidward:, You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?
,Milo:, The answer to that question is a big N-O. ,[points to Mini Squid], This little fella on the other hand is woo-hoo woo-hoo good! We're offering him a million dollar contract and a sequin suit.
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheap knock off when you can have the original. ,[plays a lively tune on his clarinet and dances],
,Squidward:, Now, where do I sign? ,[Milo laughs],
,Milo:, Yeah, right, kid! ,[takes Mini Squid],
,SpongeBob:, Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies! ,[laughs], Remember?
,Mini Squid:, Yep, those were the days.
,SpongeBob:, But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere.
,Milo:, Alright, kid, let's go become a sensation. Oh, and I'll see you at the Clammy Awards. Oh no, I guess I won't. ,[laughs, coughs and leaves],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Squidward cries], Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?
,Squidward:, My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't have to see that Mini Squid ever again!

Squidward smells the aroma of the freshly-baked cookies. He then goes into his living room and sets the pan of four, neatly organized, pieces of pointed toast on his coffee table then removes his oven mitts. A few clams grab his apron and carry it away.

,Norton:, No. I guess I'm just this idiot.

,Norton:, Well, when you get an invitation to a party, sometimes they put ""plus one"" on it, to tell you it's okay to bring along a friend.
,Squidward:, Do you have to do it?
,Norton:, Well, no, you could go alone. It's just that everyone will laugh at you 'cause they think you're a friendless loser.
,Squidward:, What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?

,Squidward:, What? What are you... Oh! ,[laughs], You always were a big kidder, huh? ,[laughs a bit], Mailman ,[thinks a second], guy?

,Squidward:, Say, I bet we have a lot in common.
,Norton:, ,[laughs nervously], Yeah, I don't know. I'm just a regular guy. But in not being a mailman, I love going to fancy art galleries.
,Squidward:, That's me!
,Norton:, And eating delicious food.
,Squidward:, Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can...
,Both:, Spread on a toast point!

,Squidward:, Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind.

,Squidward:, SpongeBob!
,Norton:, Clarinets!
,Squidward:, Yeah, I know it... What?
,Norton:, I mean what kind of maniac could enjoy the sound of a clarinet? That squeaky hollow kind of piercing howl from the very pits of Gehenna. Only a deluded blow-hog, with nothing to lose, could pick up a ,[grunts], clarinet and think ""Yeah! This is for me! Let me inflict this pain on the world!"". ,[laughs], Am I right, buddy? Heh. Uh.
,[Squidward is nowhere to be seen.],
,Norton:, Buddy? ,[slaps his face], Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you so darn opinionated, Norton? All you do with your searing and abnormal honesty is drive everyone away! When's Norton's time? When's Norton's time to shine?!
,Widow Duncan:, Oh, Norton! I've always taken a shine to you. ,[winks as her dentures slide out],
,[Norton nervously slides the dentures back in Widow Duncan's mouth and runs away. The scene changes to Squidward walking down a street in Bikini Bottom until he sees a can tied to a string.],
,Squidward:, Oh, you think you know a guy? ,[kicks can], Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend.
,SpongeBob:, ,[talks through can], I'll be your friend.
,Squidward:, ,[grumbles as he picks up the can], Who is this?
,SpongeBob:, It's me, SpongeBob.
,[Squidward looks at the can and reads the label, ""Protein Powder"" on it. The label on the can gives him an idea.],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Yes? I'm still here.
,Squidward:, I need to ask you something important.
,[SpongeBob blinks his eyes in excitement.],
,SpongeBob:, You don't have to ask me three times.
,[SpongeBob rips his pants and reveals a tuxedo underneath.],
,Squidward:, Will you tell Larry I wanna talk to him?
,[Squidward runs off and drops the can.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh.
,[SpongeBob picks up the can and sadly starts to play jump rope.],
,SpongeBob:, Okey-doke.
,[The scene changes to several of Larry's friends working out. Squidward is seen standing next to Larry as he is talking to him.],
,Larry:, So, Squidward, what do you wanna talk about?
,Squidward:, Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words.
,Larry:, Oh, I've been there, amigo.
,Squidward:, You have?
,Larry:, Sure. But nothing clears the sawdust out of your brains quicker than a ride on a jet ski.
,[Larry holds out a jet ski.],
,Larry:, Ever been on one of these little babies?
,Squidward:, Um, no. The.. They always seemed a little sporty for me.
,Larry:, Well, you only live once. And I just happen to have an extra helmet.
,[Larry holds out a helmet for Squidward.],
,Squidward:, What the heck?
,[Squidward puts on the helmet and rides with Larry across the water. As they ride, they draw images of Squidward and Larry in the water. Then the fly off a ramp and ride across the beach. The ride through some people standing in line at a ride in the amusement park.],
,Unnamed fish:, Hey!
,[Larry and Squidward ride on the rails of a roller coaster with the jet ski. Squidward is then playing a game of pool with Larry. Then Squidward and Larry are watching a movie and eating popcorn with the jet ski. Squidward and Larry are now at a wig store playing music with the bongos and the clarinet while the jet ski is holding a saxophone. A man passes by and donates money to them.],
,Squidward:, We make quite a team!
,Larry:, I'll say!
,Squidward:, You know, earlier today I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music.
,Larry:, Hey, you know that's very uncool. What kind of thoughtless ding-dong would knock another man's passion?
,Squidward:, You know, you're alright, Lester.
,Larry:, It's Larry.
,Squidward:, Whatever. The point is do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?
,Larry:, Well, that's not my kind of thing at all, but for you sure. I'll just need to stop by the apartment and make myself a protein shake.
,Squidward:, What?! You don't need that glop!
,Larry:, Oh, I wouldn't call it ""glop"". Protein shake saved my life, bro.
,Squidward:, Oh, come on. It's a fad. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. ""I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake.""
,[Squidward bumps into Larry while he continues to mock. He looks up and sees Larry in extreme anger after the way he made fun of him.],
,Squidward:, ,[dumbfounded], I mean...
,[Larry punches Squidward to the ground and walks off. Squidward pops his head out.],
,Squidward:, So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?
,[Squidward looks at his reflection on the window.],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], I guess it's just you and me again.
,[Squidward turns and sees SpongeBob breathing heavily.],
,Squidward:, ,[scoffs], What are you doing here?
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds out his jump rope], Just playing draggy rope. You wanna play?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, You hold on to one end of the rope and you drag it behind you like a sea snake is chasing you like this. Wanna play?
,Squidward:, Just get me out of here!
,SpongeBob:, ,[silence], Will do.
,[SpongeBob pulls Squidward out of the hole with the jump rope, but ends up making him fall flat on his face.],
,Squidward:, Thanks.
,SpongeBob:, Anything for a friend.
,[Squidward comes up with an idea.],
,Squidward:, Friend?
,[Squidward sees his reflection in SpongeBob's eyes and grins.],
,Squidward:, Would you be my plus one?
,[SpongeBob gasps in excitement. The scene changes to people attending the Galleria Diptheria. A limousine drives up and Squidward, who is now wearing a tuxedo, steps out.],
,Squidward:, Come on, SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob, in a black suit, comes out of the limousine with a mirror that shows Squidward's reflection and closes the door. Squidward and SpongeBob walk across the red rug with the mirror.],
,Perch Perkins:, And here comes Squidward Tentacles and what must be either a bizarre piece of performance art or the saddest display of loneliness it has ever been my displeasure to report. One is inclined to suspect the second thing I said. A thing about sadness!
,[Squidward and SpongeBob stop in the middle.],
,Squidward's reflection:, You'll always be my plus one!
,Squidward:, Aww!
,[The episode ends with people taking random pictures of Squidward, SpongeBob and the mirror with Squidward's reflection on it.],

"[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office with an adding machine, singing],
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profit will make me wallet fat!♪
,[His eyes bug out at the ticker tape],
,Mr. Krabs:, What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!
,[Meanwhile, Squidward is helping Martha in his ordering boat at the dining area of the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.
,[Gives Martha a dollar, and she walks off. Mr. Krabs approaches him],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward!
,Squidward:, What?
,Mr. Krabs:, What's with all this ""change"" nonsense?
,[SpongeBob walks over, knotting his tie],
,SpongeBob:, Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up! ,[Squidward becomes exasperated, and sighs deeply], Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.
,Squidward:, You hardly pay us at all!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.
,[He hands his employees envelopes],
,Squidward:, Ah, yes! Our meager restitution. ,[He takes the envelope and smells it], Ah, the sweet smell of payday. ,[He opens it and finds a pair of underwear], Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning. ,[Trades envelopes with him], Here's your check.
,[He gives SpongeBob an envelope as well],
,Mr. Krabs:, And here's yours, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs. ,[Holds up his spatula], Grilling is my passion!
,[Mr. Krabs greedily takes the envelope back],
,Squidward:, What is this!?! ,[He sees that there is a bill instead of a check. It charges Squidward for breathing, talking, standing, existing, lollygagging, and chewing], You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?
,Mr. Krabs:, There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.
,[SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, preparing money for him],
,SpongeBob:, 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe. ,[Mr. Krabs is drooling over SpongeBob's cash, and Squidward pulls SpongeBob towards him],
,Squidward:, Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?
,SpongeBob:, I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.
,Squidward:, Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Squidward:, We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!
,SpongeBob:, Wow! You and me go on strike?
,Squidward:, Sure! After all, you like your job, right?
,SpongeBob:, Right!
,Squidward:, And you want to keep working here, right?
,SpongeBob:, Right!
,Squidward:, And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?
,SpongeBob:, Right!
,Squidward:, Then let's go on strike!
,SpongeBob:, Yay! A strike! ,[He starts to sing excitedly], ♪Goin' on a strike! We’re goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪ ,[He inadvertently kicks Mr. Krabs in the butt as Krabs sweeps the floor], Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!
,Mr. Krabs:, A strike?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, You mean you're going to make picket signs?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, And you're going to make protest speeches?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, yeah!
,Mr. Krabs:, And you're going to demand me respect?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! ,[Cut to SpongeBob sobbing outside of the Krusty Krab], Noo... ,[Squidward is with him], No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I... ,[He cries more], Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! ,[He grabs SpongeBob and pulls him off the door, but his arms and legs stick], News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too! ,[SpongeBob is suctioned to the door. Squidward pulls him off again, and this time his face remains pressed against the door], This is exactly why we need to go on strike. ,[SpongeBob flies back to the door. Squidward pulls him off once more, and this time SpongeBob's front sticks to the door, and we can see his skeleton and internal organs on his other side], He can't treat us like this anymore! ,[SpongeBob goes back to the door and Squidward's eyes become bloodshot], He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward look through the door to see Mr. Krabs blowing dust off his old ""Help Wanted"" sign], Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united! ,[SpongeBob holds Squidward's hand], Ahem.
,SpongeBob:, ,[withdraws his hand], Sorry.
,Squidward:, Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time, you'll have your job back and more.
,SpongeBob:, And more?
,[He imagines himself in his Krusty Krew uniform hat, except his hat is much bigger],
,Squidward:, Alright, SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms, ,[He takes off his hat], they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so. ,[Squidward throws it into the ground and stomps on it], Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob hesitantly takes his hat off], That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.
,[SpongeBob attempts to do so, but the hat sticks to his hand despite the fact he no longer has any grip on it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams in frustration], I can't do it, Squidward. This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, you're pathetic. Look, I threw my hat to the ground.
,[A police fish walks up to Squidward with a ticket],
,Officer John:, Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.
,[He sticks the ticket to Squidward's forehead and leaves. Later, Squidward and SpongeBob are painting signs],
,Squidward:, Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.
,[SpongeBob holds up a picket fence on a stick],
,SpongeBob:, Like this, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!
,[SpongeBob holds up a sign that has a finger picking his nose],
,SpongeBob:, How's this?
,Squidward:, ...No. ,[Picks up his], This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point. ,[SpongeBob holds up his similar one that reads ""Krusty Krab Funfair""],
,SpongeBob:, How about this, Squidward?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, it's ""unfair,"" not ""funfair""!
,[A fish walks by],
,Sandals:, A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.
,SpongeBob:, At the Krusty Krab.
,Sandals:, Hey, everybody! Let's go to the fun fair! ,[A crowd of fish trample Squidward to get the restaurant. Later, SpongeBob is holding a sign that says ""No Fair!"" on it],
,SpongeBob:, Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
,[A teenager fish with a cap and braces walks up],
,Teenage Fry Cook:, What the heck does that mean?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
,Teenage Fry Cook:, Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!
,SpongeBob:, Yep!
,Teenage Fry Cook:, Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?
,[He pulls out a pen],
,SpongeBob:, Anything for an aspiring fry cook. ,[SpongeBob signs the spatula], So, did you come down to help out the cause?
,Teenage Fry Cook:, No, I came to take your job.
,[SpongeBob is shocked. The fish grabs his spatula and pen and runs into the Krusty Krab to apply for a job],
,Teenage Fry Cook:, Hey, thanks, dude!
,[Squidward walks up and bellows at SpongeBob through the megaphone so loudly that his facial features fall off, and he flies away.],
,Squidward:, ,Attention, SpongeBob!, ,You are a terrible striker!, ,[SpongeBob inserts his eyes into their sockets], You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Squidward. ,[He holds up a sign reading, ""I Heart the Krusty Krab""], How about I try the signs again?
,Squidward:, ,[into megaphone], ,Forget the signs!, I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
,[SpongeBob stands next to a telephone pole],
,SpongeBob:, Like this, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect. ,[We see that SpongeBob is now hidden behind the telephone pole. As Squidward begins to speaks, a crowd gathers], Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!
,Miss Shell:, I knew it!
,[She slaps Dennis],
,Squidward:, ,The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!,
,[The crowd cheers],
,Archie:, Hey, what's that guy talking about?
,Francis:, I don't know, but he's got a megaphone.
,Squidward:, We will dismantle oppression board by board! ,We'll saw the foundation of big business in half,, even if it takes ,an eternity!,
,[The crowd cheers],
,SpongeBob:, ,[From behind pole], Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.
,Squidward:, With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' ,house of servitude!,
,[He speaks into Fred's face, and his eyes shoot into the back of his head. Then, they return to their sockets. Everyone cheers],
,Billy (lime fish):, Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry.
,Sandals:, Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty.
,[Everyone cheers and run into the Krusty Krab, once again trampling Squidward],
,Squidward:, Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.
,[SpongeBob walks up to him],
,SpongeBob:, That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.
,Mr. Krabs:, But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!
,SpongeBob:, Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... um... Squidward, what was that other part?
,Squidward:, Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, that, too!
,[Mr. Krabs pretends to yawn and leaves],
,SpongeBob:, And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
,[Squidward's eyes become bloodshot. SpongeBob's voice echoes ""forever"" in Squidward's mind as he opens the door to his house, takes a bath, looks in the mirror, and sits in bed, wide-eyed. He seems to have a case of insomnia as the word haunts him],
,Squidward:, On strike with SpongeBob... forever?! ,[He imagines himself as an old man with a white beard holding a sign reading, ""Krusty Still Unfair."" Cobwebs branch from him to the ground. An old SpongeBob approaches him, supported by a cane],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day. ,[tugs Squidward's beard], Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? ,[bonks Squidward on the head with his cane], Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? ,[floats around Squidward], Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?
,[Back to reality as Squidward lies in bed screaming],
,Squidward:, I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
,[He runs to the door and opens it, and Krabs is there in his nightclothes, about to knock on it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy. ,[He grovels at Squidward's feet], The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone! ,[The teenagers appear right outside the door],
,Teenagers:, Alright, Mr. Krabs! ,[They give him the thumbs up],
,Mr. Krabs:, See what I mean? ,[sobbing], Squidward, please! You gotta come back!
,Squidward:, You'll give us anything we want?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms?
,Mr. Krabs:, I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
,[Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's pineapple house, where he sits on his bed listening to a country record],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action! ,[He kicks open his front door, hammer and saw in hand. He runs to the Krusty Krab and into the dining room], I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board! ,[He pulls up a loose floorboard. He then saws a table in half], I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business! ,[He takes a bite out of a wooden column. Mouth full], Squidward will be so proud!
,[Cut to Squidward and Krabs, now fully dressed, walking to the Krab at dawn],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.
,Squidward:, I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!
,[Squidward sees a disassembled Krusty Krab and screams. Krabs seems not to notice and hums as he puts his key where the door used to be, unlocking nothing. SpongeBob peeks out from the mangled sign pole. He runs out, trying to hold in his laughter],
,Squidward:, S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
,SpongeBob:, I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.
,[Krabs walks through the rubble of the Krusty Krab, oblivious, and sits in his chair. Only then, does he see the debris. Only the floor and base of the walls remain, so when he looks straight ahead from his chair, he can see Squidward and SpongeBob at the dilapidated door frame. Krabs' arms pop off followed by his eyes. His head slides off his torso and onto the floor where his nose falls out of it. Then his pelvis and legs fall out of his chair],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward! SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob is excited, but Squidward is nervous],
,Both:, Yes, Mr. Krabs?
,SpongeBob (whispers):, Here it comes!
,Mr. Krabs:, In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!
,SpongeBob:, Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!
,[""Forever"" once again echoes inside Squidward's mind, and the camera zooms in on his bloodshot eyes],
,Narrator:, One eternity later...
,[The Krusty Krab is shown to have full of dust, but without any customers. Cobwebs are everywhere. A skeleton Squidward brushes off the floor, and a skeleton SpongeBob waits in the ordering boat.],

Too calm. ,[Dark clouds fill the sky], Dark sky. ,[Blood shoots out of the water], Water spouts.... of blood. ,[Three donuts fall from the sky. Krabs takes a bite of one], Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley. ,[another donut falls from the sky. The scene cuts to an island. Not the one Sandy landed on, but an island],

,Squidward:, SpongeBob, what are you doing with that seaweed?

,Twitch:, Welcome to our remote island.
,SpongeBob:, Island?

,Twitch:, That's right, kemosabay. Island. Although, we sometimes refer to it as an... island.

,SpongeBob:, ,[stops running and crying], Cool!
,[The scene cuts to a scene where Twitch is teaching SpongeBob and Patrick to surf. A narrator speaks],
,Narrator:, Ah, learning how to surf. To some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day.
,[Twitch gives SpongeBob and Patrick each a surfboard],
,Narrator:, Others...
,[SpongeBob and Patrick take bites out of their surfboards],
,Narrator:, ... well... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. Sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[throw their boards into the water],
,Narrator:, And sometimes, it's the retreat.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick's surfboards get hit by a wave and are knocked back to shore. Everyone runs away from the flying surfboards, screaming.. SpongeBob, Patrick and Twitch are sitting on surfboards],
,Narrator:, Once in a life-time, that perfect wave comes along. Not too big, not too small, and the surfer has to act fast...
,Twitch:, Go!
,Narrator:, ... or he stands to miss the ride of his life.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?
,Patrick:, You bet!
,SpongeBob:, Down here! ,[goes underwater with Patrick], See? It's a picture of Squidward!
,Patrick:, Wow.
,Narrator:, But all in all, in life, it's not whether we win or lose, but whether we get totally stoked.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[running around while yelling, ""Loo, loo, loo!"" over and over again.. The scene cuts back to the house made of guano],
,Twitch:, Well, dudes, I give up.
,Awesome Eddie:, What?
,Twitch:, These ho-dads are impossible to teach. ,[twitches], Especially the one on the end over there. ,[points to Squidward, whose head is wet and has seaweed on it. Big G coughs],
,Awesome Eddie:, What's that?
,[Big G coughs again],
,Awesome Eddie:, Oh, no. There's no way, dude. He'd never do it.
,[Big G coughs again],
,SpongeBob:, What's he saying?
,Twitch:, He reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. If you can find him.
,SpongeBob:, Who?
,Twitch:, His name ,[twitches], is Jack Kahuna Laguna. Or JKL, for short.
,Awesome Eddie and Chip:, Amen. ,[Big G coughs],
,Twitch:, We say that legend says that JKL was last seen up-river at the Kahmamoku Cove, where every wave is perfect.
,Patrick:, Will there be nachos there? ,[Squidward looks angrily at him. The scene cuts to the river that SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are about to go into],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch.
,Twitch:, ,[twitches], No problem. And just keep following the river straight up until you hit Kahmamoku Cove. Can't miss it.
,SpongeBob:, How far up stream did you say it was?
,Twitch:, Well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there.
,Awesome Eddie:, We're definitely afraid of this river and wouldn't even set foot in it if you paid us.
,Twitch:, Yeah, interpret that any way you want.
,[On the TV version, the commercials are shown here. When they end, Sandy is shown lying on a beach],
,Sandy:, Oh, where am I? Where is everybody? I'm stranded. SpongeBob, where are you?!
,[As a song plays, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward paddle themselves slowly up-river. Eventually, they come across a waterfall. Patrick takes a picture of it and SpongeBob stares at it, admiringly. Squidward sits, bored. Then, they go down a waterfall. They scream and land. At the bottom SpongeBob and Patrick laugh while Squidward sits, bored],
,♪I'll make a beeline for the treeline. Getting back to nature always does me good. I'll make a beeline for the treeline, I just can't wait to get back in the woods. And if I need to close my eyes and dream, Of some quite mountain or stream, That's when I make the beeline for the treeline.♪
,SpongeBob:, Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe.
,Squidward:, Again?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks through a bush and comes across a sign that says, Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove, Home of J.K.L., ESO], Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove! JKL! Guys! Guys! I found the Cove! ,[giggles],
,Squidward:, I bet this guy won't even be here. If he's anything like that last group of dirty drop-outs.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here.
,Squidward:, You've never even seen him!
,SpongeBob:, You've got to stop judging people by the way they look. ,[close-up on his face. He is very ugly],
,Squidward:, ,[grossed out], You're right.
,Patrick:, ,[pointing to a hut], Look!
,[a really long surfboard begins to emerge from the hut],
,SpongeBob:, It's him!
,Squidward:, ,[sighs. The surfboard continues to come out. It is revealed to be huge], Oh, my j- ,[faints. A man emerges from the hut],
,SpongeBob:, It's JKL! Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee.
,Patrick:, Plus, we wanna talk to you.
,SpongeBob:, Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home? ,[JKL says nothing],
,Patrick:, Uh...
,Squidward:, Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?
,Patrick:, I kinda like staring at him.
,[Jack Kahuna Laguna jumps into the water with his surfboard. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward stare at him. Dolphins jump near the back of JKL's surfboard. SpongeBob and Patrick start to tear up],
,SpongeBob:, I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.
,JKL:, That... was your first lesson. ,[returns to his hut],
,Squidward:, What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!
,JKL:, ,[magically returnes to the water. we then see him playing his drums], Just keep breathing.
,[The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs sitting on half a surfboard in the middle of the ocean. He has put a piece of seaweed on the top of his cash register. He has also grown a gray beard],
,Mr. Krabs:, Locust. Culinary! Oh. ,[pulls a shell out of the water], Look, Cashy! ,[breaks the shell in half and connects them to the sides of the seaweed], Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy? ,[Cashy's drawer shoots out and hits the Flying Dutchman in the head who's flying by],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ow!
,Mr. Krabs:, Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!
,Dutchman:, ,[drops his groceries], Aaahhh! It's some guy I've never seen before! Argh! Who be disturbing the Flying Dutchman's walk home from the communion store? You even spilled me milk!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, there ain't no use crying over it. ,[Lightning bolts shoot everywhere], Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! I’ll protect ye!
,[The scene cuts to the island where SpongeBob and his friends are. They are sitting around a fire],
,SpongeBob:, Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?
,Squidward:, I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...
,[JKL walks by the fire and sits down with his drums],
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastic], Oh, wonderful.
,SpongeBob:, Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson.
,JKL:, ,[plays his drums. Eventually, he stops, lifts his hands to the air, then plays the drums again], Just... keep breathing. ,[returns to his hut],
,Squidward:, That's it?! I just wanna go home! ,[buries his head in his lap],
,SpongeBob:, Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?
,Squidward:, Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob walks away, then immediately returns], Well, did you talk to him?
,SpongeBob:, Yup.
,Squidward:, And?
,SpongeBob:, He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed.
,Squidward:, We're gonna be stuck here forever!
,[The scene cuts to Sandy's island],
,Sandy:, Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back. ,[climbs into and activates her helicopter], Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance.
,Dennis:, Roger, Acorn 1. You are clear for take-off.
,[Sandy flies away. The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs, the Flying Dutchman, and Cashy],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!
,Flying Dutchman:, Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, so I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, I... ,[Dutchman grabs Cashy], Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!
,[The scene cuts to one of the islands. A wave washes up on Squidward],
,Squidward:, Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[tired from staring all night], Okay...
,Squidward:, All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...
,JKL:, You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are knocked out],
,JKL:, Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers. ,[A storm of lightning starts. JKL runs away],
,SpongeBob:, Where's he going?! Come on! ,[chases after JKL. Patrick and Squidward follow SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Patrick are running, but Squidward is walking. SpongeBob and Patrick climb up a cliff],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets shocked by lightning], ,[screams], Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
,Patrick:, Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!
,[Squidward climbs the cliff. SpongeBob and Patrick climb the ""drinking fountain"" that is really a pyramid. Squidward follows],
,SpongeBob:, JKL! Is this the next part of our training?
,JKL:, ,[hands in the air. He says this in a strange, echoing voice], Uh...
,SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward:, ,[screaming in some way],
,JKL:, These clouds. They can only mean one thing.
,Patrick:, Increased chance of precipitation? ,[it starts raining],
,JKL:, Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed.
,SpongeBob:, A perfect wave?
,JKL:, The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One.
,Patrick:, Hey, that's what they used to call me!
,JKL:, It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. And you'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever. ,[Huge lightning bolts flash], The Big One is almost upon us.
,[The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and the Flying Dutchman fighting over Cashy],
,Mr. Krabs:, Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!
,Flying Dutchman:, Ya promise?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[angry], Liar! ,[Huge lightning bolts flash. Storm clouds hover and waves emerge from the water],
,Mr. Krabs:, What?
,Flying Dutchman:, Your Aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth!
,Mr. Krabs:, How do you know?
,Flying Dutchman:, Because I dated her in high school!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasp!], No! ,[Dutchman takes Cashy],
,Flying Dutchman:, Whoops! ,[accidentally throws Cashy],
,Sandy:, This weather sure is dangerous! I better be careful! ,[Cashy hits the helicopter's windshield], May Day! May Day! I'm goin' down! Repeat: Down!
,Flying Dutchman:, And now, just to make sure this never happens again, I'm gonna send you on a little trip down the- ,[Sandy's helicopter hits him in the head], -Ooh ow, ooh ow! Ooh! Ooh!
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh... where is that, exactly? ,[Dutchman lands on him. They both go underwater],
,Sandy:, ,[spinning out of control], May Day!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pops up from underwater], Oh, all alone again. ,[Cashy pops up from the water], Cashy!
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[lands at the bottom of the ocean. A sock lands on his face], Oh, what the... a gym sock? But that means...
,Davy Jones:, Yeah, that's right, baby! Welcome... to my locker! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! ♪For a day-dream believer and a homecoming queen!♪ ,[throws a sock at the Flying Dutchman. Music plays. The scene cuts to Kahmamoku Cove],
,JKL:, Get ready, dudes. It's coming.
,SpongeBob:, JKL, thanks for teaching us how to surf.
,JKL:, Little dude, I didn't teach you anything you didn't already know.
,Squidward:, Here it comes!
,SpongeBob:, Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye.
,JKL:, Wait. There's something I forgot to tell you. In return for its awesomeness, the Big One always demands a sacrifice. One of you... will not return.
,Squidward:, I volunteer SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward surf toward the Big One],
,SpongeBob:, Keep paddling, Patrick!
,Patrick:, This wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades!
,SpongeBob:, It's... the Big One!
,Big One:, Ha ha ha ha ha! ,[grabs Patrick's surfboard],
,Patrick:, No!
,Big One:, ,[puts salt on the surfboard and takes a bite of it], Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggg!
,Patrick:, Hey, I was gonna eat that!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, grab on!
,Big One:, ,[stares at Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[panics], Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! ,[jumps on SpongeBob and Patrick's surfboard],
,SpongeBob:, Hang on, Squidward! This is it!
,Patrick:, Time for those lessons to pay off!
,Squidward:, Look! That's Mr. Krabs down there!
,Mr. Krabs:, You like it when I comb your hair, don't ya, Cashy?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! Hop on or you'll be stuck here forever!
,Mr. Krabs:, Who said that? ,[gets buried by the Big One],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! I never even got a chance to tell him that I...
,JKL:, ,[on his huge surfboard], Looking for this?
,SpongeBob:, JKL! And Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, And Cashy! ,[jumps on the other surfboard. Then, he drops Cashy], Cashy!
,[JKL dives off his surfboard],
,SpongeBob:, JKL!
,[Cashy lands in the Big One's mouth. JKL follows],
,SpongeBob:, No!
,JKL:, Little dude,... I was born to do this. ,[winks, waves good-bye, and is swallowed],
,Big One:, ,[burps],
,Squidward:, I guess the Big One prefers a high-protein meal.
,Patrick:, Now what are we gonna do?
,SpongeBob:, ,[plays JKL's drums. The storm clouds clear away and reveals a picture of JKL's face. The scene cuts to Goo Lagoon, where Nat and Shubie are lying on beach towels],
,Nat:, You hear a noise?
,[Sandy crashes down in her helicopter],
,Lifeguard:, Everybody, look! A You-foe! ,[meaning UFO],
,Jimmy-Gus:, A spaceman!
,Harold\Bill:, ,[holding a pitchfork], Don't make any funny moves, spaceman! You're not conquering our world without a fight!
,Sandy:, ,[slaps the pitchfork], I'm not a spaceman, you dunder-head! It's me, Sandy! SpongeBob's friend.
,Beach goers:, ,[act bored],
,Sandy:, Shucks. Now I'll never find SpongeBob and Patrick.
,Gus:, Who?
,Sandy:, My friends. They went surfing and never returned.
,Gus:, Is one of them, like, a little square dude with big teeth?
,Sandy:, You some kinda mind-reader?
,Gus:, No. ,[points at SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs],

,Squidward:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, Aww, yeah.
,Squidward:, ,[getting annoyed], Yes!
,SpongeBob:, Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest. ,[laughs. SpongeBob walks out with a bag and a long, pointy tool], Litter. ,[picks up trash], Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper? ,[laughs], Kids these days. ,[another piece of trash falls to the ground next to him. He gasps and he picks up the trash], I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now. ,[more trash keeps falling to the ground around him and he picks them up quickly. He breathes, exhausted, as one more piece of litter falls down attached to a parachute. He finally snaps], Where is all this litter coming from?! ,[SpongeBob notices someone tossing trash out of a car], Not on my watch. ,[walks up to the car], Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
,Strangler:, Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police? ,[police arrive],
,SpongeBob:, Yes. ,[police begin to handcuff the Strangler. They walk past him in single-file and continue cuffing him],
,Squidward:, How's it going, Lieutenant?

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'.  When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?
,SpongeBob:, This would be him, Mr. Krabs. ,[takes out the wanted poster of The Strangler],

Take your death cloud with you! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob showing the wanted poster to people.

HOLD ME!"", leaving SpongeBob distraught],
,SpongeBob:, ,[at the bus stop], Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard. ,[Strangler sits on a bench reading a newspaper],

,Strangler:, Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.
,SpongeBob:, I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty. ,[Strangler shows his filthy hands and laughs. Before the Strangler starts to strangle SpongeBob, a bus stops next to them and the Strangler puts his hands behind his back and smiles, as the bus drives off],
,Strangler:, Huh? Uh-oh. Uh, there's too many witnesses around here. ,[walks up to SpongeBob], Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card. ,[Shows SpongeBob his drawn-over fake ID card],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next? ,[a five cent sticker is hanging from the Strangler's fake mustache],
,Strangler:, Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man. ,[he points to an old man with a walker], Or that baby. ,[points to a baby in a stroller],
,SpongeBob:, Or that pebble. ,[points to a small rock on the ground], Or that stick. ,[points to a stick on the ground], Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium. ,[points to a white piece of paper],
,Strangler:, Huh? Uhh, that's mine. ,[picks it up and puts it in his pocket],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
,Strangler:, Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...
,SpongeBob:, We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
,Strangler:, Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected. ,[laughs as the lights grow dim], Perfect. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, excellent. ,[laughs with the Strangler until the lights turn on again], Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.
,Strangler:, Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.
,SpongeBob:, Quick is my middle name. ,[scene cuts to the grocery store], Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?

,SpongeBob:, I'll take both! ,[scene cuts to 'Dry Cleaning While-U-Wait'],
,Dry Cleaner:, Here you go, Mr. SquarePants. ,[he hands him his clothes],
,SpongeBob:, Hmmm.
,Dry Cleaner:, Is there something wrong?
,SpongeBob:, I'm not sure if these are my pants. ,[Strangler groans. Scene cuts to the perfume store where SpongeBob sprays some perfume on his wrist and holds it up to the Strangler], How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
,Strangler:, Can we just go to your house?! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob's house],
,SpongeBob:, Here we are. SquarePants Manor. Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
,Strangler:, All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...
,SpongeBob:, Protect me?
,Strangler:, Thanks.
,SpongeBob:, Don't mention it, Strangler. ,[gasps], I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key? ,[searches his pocket for the key as the Strangler gets angry],
,Narrator:, Twenty minutes later... ,[SpongeBob is still searching for his key. The Strangler gets even more angry],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?
,Strangler:, Oh, forget the key! Let's climb through this window. ,[struggles reaching for the window], I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid?  ,[SpongeBob is wearing cleats],
,SpongeBob:, Sure. With these spiky cleats, anything is possible. ,[jumps onto the Strangler], Ya.
,Strangler:, Cleats?! ,[SpongeBob's feet land on the Strangler's eyeballs. The Strangler screams in pain], Get your feet out of my eye sockets! ,[SpongeBob starts tugging at his legs],
,SpongeBob:, I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas! ,[Strangler runs around in pain],
,Narrator:, Six hours later... ,[Strangler is still running around until he pulls SpongeBob's feet out of his eyes. Scene cuts to the Strangler with bandages on his eyes],
,SpongeBob:, Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside. ,[The Strangler's eyes open widely. The Strangler growls in anger and a nuclear explosion comes out of his head], There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door. ,[Strangler sneaks up behind SpongeBob ready to strangle him. SpongeBob opens the door and walks in], Step inside...
,Strangler:, ,[closes the door], Close the door...
,SpongeBob:, Well, here we are.
,Strangler:, I've finally got you all alone! ,[laughs evilly],
,SpongeBob:, I know, isn't it great? ,[laughs. Strangler picks up SpongeBob], Ooh.
,Strangler:, Now, you're gonna get yours... tattletale! ,[lights turn on],
,All of SpongeBob's friends:, Surprise! ,[all of SpongeBob's friends are in his house cheering. They drop a sign that says 'Congratulations, SpongeBob! 100% On Time!'],
,SpongeBob:, A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work? ,[Strangler nervously places his hands behind his back], Oh, how'd you guys know?
,Patrick:, It's on the invitations you sent us. ,[holds an invitation up], Let's boogie! ,[everyone parties. The Strangler sits down in SpongeBob's chair. Scene cuts to the end of the party],
,SpongeBob:, Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest. ,[everyone else leaves and he walks back into the house and laughs], Ahh, alone at last.

,SpongeBob:, Just you, me, and the floorboards. ,[Strangler and SpongeBob begin laughing again], Yeah. ,[there's a knock on the door. SpongeBob opens it],

,SpongeBob:, Thanks for coming! ,[closes the door. Laughs], Alone again.
,Strangler:, Is it true? Everybody's gone?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,Strangler:, No, no more parties today? You got everything you need now? Nobody's left? We're completely alone?
,SpongeBob:, Oh yeah.
,Strangler:, In that case... ,[laughs evilly until Patrick appears out of nowhere],
,Patrick:, Great parties, huh?
,Strangler:, Oh... sorry, Tubby, you've gotta go. ,[carries Patrick away],
,SpongeBob:, Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
,Strangler:, Well, I can't take any chances. For all we know, he could be the Strangler.
,Patrick:, I'm the Strangler? Oh, I should've known! I gotta turn myself in! ,[runs and breaks through the wall],
,SpongeBob:, So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.
,Strangler:, ,[growls], HE’S NOT THE STRANGLER!!!!!!
,SpongeBob:, He's not?

,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, for Pete's sake. ,[uses his pinchers to snap of SpongeBob's legs, knee down] ,Sorry 'bout the legs boyo.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], It's okay! I'm a sponge, remember? ,[legs grow back],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Well, good! Now, I want you back on the grill tomorrow morning. And if it makes you feel anymore manly, you can do your grilling outdoors!
,SpongeBob:, Sounds great! And I'll be driving to work.
,Driving Instructor:, Wait a minute! ,[he drives up], Oh no you don't! Not with those short pants! ,[takes the driving license and rips it up],

,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.
,Squidward:, If you say so. ,[as they stand up, Mr. Krabs freaks out],
,Mr. Krabs:, Egad! What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, cap'n!
,Squidward:, Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon.
,Squidward:, I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register. ,[stretches his head through the kitchen window], Whew. Can I help you?
,Customer #2:, Can I get two Krabby Patties, please?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.
,SpongeBob:, Two Krabby Patties coming right up. ,[notices the buns are out of reach], I can't... reach the buns.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what's the holdup?!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Time is money, boy.
,SpongeBob:, Time is money. Right. ,[reaches bun], Hello, bun. At last we meet. ,[Squidward can't hold the cash register. His head flies through the kitchen window, onto the grill and crashes into SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth. ,[pushes them out the restaurant], And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out.
,SpongeBob:, Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other.
,Squidward:, That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. ,[plays clarinet as they walk past a surfer],
,Surfer:, Whoa, rock on, freaky bro!
,Squidward:, Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.
,Sandy:, Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'.
,Squidward:, Hello, Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night.
,Sandy:, Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet.
,Squidward:, What'd you say?
,Sandy:, I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet]
,Squidward:, What?!? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak! ,[SpongeBob smiles], Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show!
,Sandy:, Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. ,[Squidward and SpongeBob stretch through their front doors, but can't walk much further, so their houses collide together],
,Squidward:, Of course. ,[at the clarinet recital], Oh, my. ,[not an empty seat in the house], Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar!
,Squidward:, Superstar?
,SpongeBob:, Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen!
,Squidward:, You're right! The show must go on!
,Announcer:, Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. ,[curtain rises to Squidward wearing a big cape like clothing. Squidward starts playing and everyone begins to hate it],
,Evelyn:, Honey, I'm scared. ,[the crowd continues to dislike Squidward playing the clarinet, the cape comes off as a nail tears it. SpongeBob starts to see the crowd, the crowd gasps],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, hi.
,Martin:, Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! ,[crowd cheers],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, they really liked it.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughing], There you go, Squiddy!
,Squidward:, They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And... ,[smells the air], ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.
,Sandy:, Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time.
,SpongeBob and Squidward:, Sandy?
,Sandy:, One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward try to tell Sandy not to blast them, but was too late, she blasts the ray at Squidward and SpongeBob and it separates them. Crowd gasps],
,Squidward:, ,[SpongeBob gives him back his clarinet], Hmph. ,[plays clarinet off-key making SpongeBob cheer for him, but the audience hates it as they block their ears, Old Man Jenkins faints off his chair],
,Mary:, I think I'm going to be sick! ,[Squidward blows his clarinet at Billy, which blows his skin off and shows his skeleton],
,Billy:, Ah, I'm out of here!
,Squidward:, Huh, no, wait. Wait! ,[everyone leaves], Oh, my one moment of fame... gone. ,[grabs the separator ray], There's got to be some way to reverse this. ,[pushes the button over and over],
,Sandy:, No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, I wouldn't--! ,[laser blasts into the final scene],
,Therapist:, So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?
,Squidward:, It all started when I was born. ,[camera zooms out to show Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, Larry, SpongeBob, and Squidward joined together],

"[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab, outside. The scene then cuts to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Squidward is reading a book called Art. SpongeBob's eye appears through the kitchen window, and he looks at him. Mr. Krabs walks up to Squidward, putting his arm on the cash register-boat, smiling. He tries to clear his throat to attract attention.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Bleh!
,Squidward:, ,[doesn't look up from his book, but his head raises], May I help you?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Squidward lowers his head back down again], Well... it's almost quittin' time, Squidward. You... got any big plans for after work? ,[Squidward licks his tentacle, and flips the page],.
,Squidward:, Nope. ,[Mr. Krabs frowns at him and SpongeBob blinks. Mr. Krabs walks away and SpongeBob disappears from the window, then appears again next to Squidward at the cash register-boat. He blinks, and that is when Squidward notices him and squints at him, he starts grunting furiously],.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward. ,[his voice is a little bit lower], Pretty incredible shift, huh?
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], If you say so.
,SpongeBob:, Any plans after work?
,Squidward:, ,[annoyed], No.
,SpongeBob:, ,[relaxed voice], Yeah, me neither. Just gonna be hangin' at 'Casa de Esponja'. Feel free to drop by if you're in the neighborhood. ,[giggles], ,[Squidward disappears, leaving his work hat and his book, Art, behind. The scene cuts and Squidward is seen walking away from the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob follows after him], Hey, Squidward. Wait up! Squidward! I realized I really didn't extend a proper invitation back there. ,[holds out his hand], So what do ya say, Squidward? How about you come over to my house for a visit tonight? ,[Squidward doesn't respond. SpongeBob pokes him],. Squidward? ,[pokes him again], Squidward? ,[pokes him again], Squidward? ,[pokes him once more], Squidward? ,[Squidward stops walking, and SpongeBob walks right into him. He backs up a few spaces],.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, thank you so much for that lovely invitation but I must respectfully tell you I will never visit you. ,[yells], ,Ever!, ,[his yell blows SpongeBob away. A chicken clucking is heard, and Squidward walks away. Squidward sighs], Take heart, Squidward, it'll all be over soon. ,[he stops to see SpongeBob sobbing and holding onto his leg],.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sobbing into a puddle], Oh, please come over for a visit, Squidward! It's been so long. I can't even remember your last visit. ,[He keeps on crying],
,Squidward:, That's probably because I've never visited you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[continues sobbing childishly], Please? Please? Please?! ,[Squidward is at the bus stop], Please?! Please?! ,[bus comes up, and when it leaves, the puddles from SpongeBob's crying are still there. This scene is a quick cameo at the laundromat], Please? ,[The scene goes to Barg'N-Mart], Please? ,[cuts to a restaurant], Please? Please? Please? ,[cuts to Squidward's house], Please, please? Pleeeaase? Pleaaaaaase? Please? Please? ,[Squidward is still dragging SpongeBob. He picks SpongeBob up, and shoves him of his tentacles on his doormat, walks in, stomps on him, and closes the door. SpongeBob immediately gets up],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward. Maybe some other time. ,[waves and walks away. Time card ""24 Hours Later"" appears],
,French Narrator:, Twenty-four hours later... ,[Squidward is again reading a book called 'Art' at the Krusty Krab, when SpongeBob appears. Squidward moans],
,SpongeBob:, Hey-ho, Squidward. You got any... ,[Squidward grabs SpongeBob's lips],
,Squidward:, Before you ask me that question, ask yourself this: Why would I leave the comfort of ,my, home for your dirty ,little hovel,? ,[he keeps pulling on SpongeBob's lips which immediately pull back onto his face. SpongeBob smiles],
,SpongeBob:, What if I got a couple of throw pillows?
,SpongeBob:, ,[cuts to the outside of Conch Street. The camera keeps on slowly zooming in on SpongeBob's house. Next, the camera is inside SpongeBob's house where he and Patrick are putting together a puzzle],. Patrick? Has Squidward ever visited you at home? ,[Patrick is trying to work two pieces of a puzzle with are both two shades of green together. The camera immediately goes to the next clip which is directly on Patrick],
,Patrick:, Only once. To take back some stuff I borrowed. ,[The clip goes to SpongeBob whose finger is on a puzzle piece in a light shade of green and who is moving it back and forth],
,SpongeBob:, He said he wouldn't leave the comfort of his own home for my ""dirty little hovel"".
,Patrick:, ,[holding some glue, possibly puzzle glue. He glues it on a puzzle piece spilling lots of it onto the table], Borrow something, and he'll have to come over to get it back. ,[He smushes the already-glued puzzle piece into the big pile of glue], Uhh! ,[Patrick scoots out of his chair and walks out of the kitchen], Well... hey, thanks for lettin' me play puzzle with you. See ya later! ,[he goes outside, SpongeBob snaps his fingers],
,SpongeBob:, That's it!
,Squidward:, ,[from inside], A stick of butter, and just a touch of pepper... ,[Squidward is at his table cooking, pouring salt.], Dya—ah! ,[hammering on nails is heard, surprising Squidward, causing the pepper to fly up in the air, and to land in one of Squidward's plants. As it tilts, some of the pepper spills onto the rug], Not on the rug! ,[Goes to his window and opens it up], SpongeBob! Will you keep it down? I am trying to cook! ,[The window to SpongeBob's house opens, and there is SpongeBob holding a hammer],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Squidward! Just doin' a little home improvement.
,Squidward:, Well, you made me spill pepper all over my imported rug! ,[points his tentacle down and shuts the window. SpongeBob waves, smiling],
,SpongeBob:, Oh-okay, Squidward. ,[Squidward sighs],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! ,[walks toward his closet], I need the right tool for the job. Huh? ,[he sees a little note with a smiley sun, and SpongeBob in Squidward's thoughts reads what it says],
,SpongeBob:, Dear Squidward, Thanks For lending me your vacuum cleaner! Sincerely, SpongeBob SquarePants. ,[the note turns into SpongeBob's face who says],... Oh, P.S. ,[laughs each time the camera zooms on Squidward's face. Cuts to SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob hits his desk, and the telephone flies up in the air, and lands in SpongeBob's hand. SpongeBob is in a relaxed mood.],
,SpongeBob:, SquarePants residence. ,[Squidward's red phone is seen],
,Squidward:, Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?
,SpongeBob:, ,[excited], Squidward! ,[wiggles fingers], It's been a while since I last got a call from my favorite next-door neighbor! ,[Squidward slaps his head],
,Squidward:, ,[angered], That's because I've never called you! Now, why have you stolen my vacuum cleaner?
,SpongeBob:, I didn't steal it, silly, I borrowed it.
,Squidward:, Are you done cleaning up that dingy hole you call home?
,SpongeBob:, ,[excited], You won't even recognize the place, Squidward! ,[gasps excitedly],
,Squidward:, Yeah, probably not. ,[SpongeBob keeps on gasp-like panting. Goes to the window between Squidward's and SpongeBob's houses who are looking at each other by their windows], I'll be over to get my vacuum in twenty minutes. ,[slams the window shut],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward is finally coming over for a visit! ,[goes to Squidward putting a casserole in the oven, mumbling in anger],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Cuts to the next scene. Squidward is knocking on SpongeBob's door.  The door opens to see SpongeBob. The inside of his house is seen dark green with SpongeBob smiling], Squidward! I've been expecting you! Welcome to my humble abode! I hope that you will find comfort. And please don't hesitate to ask me if there's anything I can... ,[Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the way, mumbling softly],
,Squidward:, I just want my vacuum back... ,[with a shocked look on his face], You've made an exact replica of my living room! ,[camera pans left to right revealing everything in Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Squidward's mouth drops wide open], Well, you said you wouldn't leave the comfort of my home, ,[puts out his hands], so I brought the comfort here! ,[louder voice], Isn't it great?! ,[SpongeBob laughs, Squidward gets angry],
,Squidward:, ,[yelling], No! It isn't! You can't just steal my decorating style, and... ,[slaps his face, and rubs his tentacle down it], Never mind. Just give me my vacuum. ,[Ignoring Squidward, SpongeBob holds up a cup of iced tea with a blue bendy straw, a lemon, and a pink umbrella],
,SpongeBob:, Would you care for a cool and refreshing iced tea? ,[Squidward throws it down],
,Squidward:, No. ,[SpongeBob holds another dish up],
,SpongeBob:, Hot hors d'oeuvres? ,[Squidward throws it down],
,Squidward:, No. ,[holds another dish up],
,SpongeBob:, Nachos? ,[Squidward throws it down],
,Squidward:, No. ,[SpongeBob holds another dish up],
,SpongeBob:, Blancmange?
,Squidward:, I-I don't even know that that is! ,[throws it down], Please just give me my vacuum so I can get back home. I have a casserole in the oven!
,SpongeBob:, ,[raises his finger, still ignoring Squidward], Yes, of course. ,[brings Squidward to the couch], Please take a seat while I go grab your vacuum. ,[pats it], Please make yourself at home! ,[Squidward mumbles in anger as SpongeBob fluffs a pillow], Enjoying your visit so far, Squidward?
,Squidward:, This is not a visit. You are going to get my vacuum. ,[grabs the pillow SpongeBob is fluffing from him], And stop fluffing this pillow!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward, just yell if you need anything. ,[walks away],
,Squidward:, Imbecile. ,[gasps], How did he do it? ,[pans across Squidward's coffee table], He got my coffee table, my vase, snack table, coasters, and my Art of the Clarinet Coffee Table Book. ,[he picks up the pillow SpongeBob was fluffing], And this pillow looks just like the one Mommy made for me. He even copied her stitch signature! ""For Squiddy, with love, Mama."" ,[yells, SpongeBob appears out of nowhere],
,SpongeBob:, You yelled?
,Squidward:, ,[angry], Never mind! I'll find the vacuum myself! ,[puts down the pillow and walks away],
,SpongeBob:, Then okay! Make yourself at home! Squidward sure seems to be enjoying his visit.
,Squidward:, ,[peeks through an entrance in the hallway], My hallway... ,[blinks as he sees a dent in the wall], Dear Neptune! ,[shivers, shudders, sweats and blinks], He even got the chip in the paint from when I moved in! ,[he shudderly walks down the hallway], Okay, Squiddy. Don't get creeped out. Just get the vacuum cleaner and go home. ,[opens a door], Oh, right. Isn't this neat? My bathroom. ,[he flushes the toilet, and water comes out like a fountain. He walks over to the sink], I have to give him credit, though.Every detail is correct. ,[opens the medicine cabinet], How does he know the exact contents of my medicine cabinet? ,[his eyes grow at his rash cream], My rash cream? ,[closes the cabinet], That little sneak! '
,SpongeBob:, Did someone say ""rash cream?"" ,[Squidward screams in surprise and runs into the wall, making some of the cream jump out of the bottle],
,Squidward:, ,[holding his nose], SpongeBob, you idiot!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, the rash cream. ,[Squidward keeps slips on the rash cream and falls causing more rash cream to come out of the bottle], Oops. ,[Squidward comes out wearing his shower curtain over his head, and slips on the rash cream which causes more rash cream to come out], Oh, no! ,[Squidward has a drawer stuck in his neck, and he slips on the rash cream once more, and his head falls right into his toilet. The lid then falls and flushes. SpongeBob walks right toward him], I don't think I have a cream for that.
,Squidward:, ,[sleeping on a pillow on the couch his Mom made for him. He then wakes up, and gasps, looking both ways, then sighs peacefully], Oh, what a horrible nightmare. ,[SpongeBob pops up from behind the couch],
,SpongeBob:, So, are you enjoying your stay at 'Chez Spongè?' ,[Squidward screams rocking the entire house. Squidward is now freaked out with its teeth showing],
,Squidward:, Uh... will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the bathroom again. ,[SpongeBob points at him, and winks at him],
,SpongeBob:, Tsk. ,[Squidward walks through a door], Hurry back, Squidward! ,[Squidward shuts the door],
,Squidward:, ,[sweating], I’ve gotta find that vacuum and get out of here! ,[he runs up some stairs to another hallway],
,Squidward:, ,[opens the door to a dark room, turns on the lights, sees that the room is filled with all of his self-portraits and screams. Petrified, he walks to the center of the room to view the paintings that covered every inch of the walls], He copied all 492 of my self-portraits... ,[camera directs on three of them individually], ...and they're better than mine! ,[starts sniveling, crying, and whimpering, sits down on the rug, and starts rocking himself], He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything. ,[touches the rug], This...all of this is just... ,[smiles], Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that... ,[walks over to a closet], posthaste! ,[he opens the door to see the things SpongeBob usually has in his house along with his vacuum cleaner, Squidward gasps], A-ha! He put you in here along with all his bad tastes! You're coming home... ,[he pulls on the vacuum without success, grunts and pulls on it harder], Home... with me... with me... ,[it finally comes out along with everything else, and Squidward yells as it all collapses on him, tilting the self-portraits, which are now crooked],
,Squidward:, ,[Gary's food bowl lands on Squidward, who is on the couch, which is tipped over. Squidward sits up to realize he has the vacuum stuck inside of him], SpongeBob! ,[he loses balance out of the room, and falls down the stairs. He stops on one stair for the vacuum whirring, and his next step makes him fall off the final stairs before choking out the vacuum], Is it really you? ,[switches the vacuum to on, allowing it to whir. He picks it up], It is you! ,[kisses it], Come on, baby. We are gonna walk out of this horror show the way we walked into it: with dignity and aplomb. ,[he walks out of SpongeBob's house to hear a siren, and sees firemen hosing his burnt house, while SpongeBob and Patrick are there], My house...
,Patrick:, You just missed the fire. ,[Squidward walks to the firemen],
,Squidward:, What happened to my house? ,[fireman holds up a burnt casserole],
,Fireman:, Oh, some knucklehead left a casserole in the oven.
,Squidward:, ,SpongeBob!,
,SpongeBob:, Aw, don't worry, Squidward. You're more than welcome to stay at my home until you get your house fixed. ,[Squidward becomes shocked with ominous music playing, he suddenly disappears to him at a table with his vacuum cleaner at the seat across from him],
,Squidward:, Why, yes, I'd love another spot of tea, Mr. Vacuum Cleaner. ,[holds up the burnt casserole], Care for some casserole? ,[crazed laughter. Camera zooms in on his pupil, and he reappears to the real life],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward? You okay? Squidward? ,[Squidward faints], ,Squidward!, ,[camera zooms out to see the burnt house with the fireman hosing again.],
,[,Scene cuts to nighttime. Squidward was inside SpongeBob's replica. He was about to sleep in his bed.,]
,Squidward:,  Ah... Replica, sweet replica.
,[Camera goes to outside as Squidward turns out the light. It moves to Squidward's burnt house to see SpongeBob and Gary there. SpongeBob in a sheet, Gary in a piece of paper with his bowl. SpongeBob yawns and stretches],
,SpongeBob:, It sure was nice having Squidward over for a visit, eh, Gary? ,[he goes to sleep. While snoring, his sheet turns to ashes],

,Squidward:, Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol. ,[bell dings], No one ever comes in on Sunday. ,[bell dings again], Why can't Mr. Krabs just let us go home? ,[bell dings again. Squidward gets angry. The scene changes to to SpongeBob ringing a bell, set on the order window. Squidward runs up to SpongeBob], SpongeBob, stop ringing this bell! ,[He picks it up and slams it on the bottom of the order window],
,SpongeBob:, I was just testing it. ,[Squidward leans through the order window getting in SpongeBob's face],
,Squidward:, I will ring the bell when there's an order. But... ,[scene zooms out to show that the restaurant is empty], There's no customers! There hasn't been one all day and there isn't gonna be any! ,[he struggles to pick up the cash register, but successfully does so and he slams it down making a bell noise],
,SpongeBob:, One Krabby Patty coming up!
,Squidward:, No!
,[The register drawer shoots open, knocking Squidward out of the way. A bunch of coins fall onto the floor. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs’ office where Mr. Krabs is writing something on a sheet of paper and he stops to hear the money dropping.],
,Mr. Krabs:, That sounds like me money dropping. ,[The scene changes to show the outside of the office and Squidward is picking up the coins. Mr. Krabs opens his office door.], What's going on out here?! My babies! ,[runs up to Squidward and shoves him away], Get away, you barbarian! What have you done? Nice, clean money... soiled! ,[scoops up the coins in his claws], I'll take care of ya. Let papa clean ya up. ,[The scene changes to show a long shot of SpongeBob staring out from the order window], Clear the way! ,[he runs into the kitchen and starts washing them off in the sink], No, no, no, don't cry, little ones.
,SpongeBob:, What's wrong, Mr. Krabs? ,[Mr. Krabs gets startled and throws the dimes in the air],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[a dime rolls into the sink and starts to roll towards the sink drain.], Me dime!  ,[The dime rolls around sink drain. Just as it seems like it's about to fall down the drain, it flips over facing away from the drain. Mr. Krabs gives a sigh of relief. Then the dime jumps, winks, and goes down the drain], No! ,[grabs the dime in the drain], I got it, boy!,[tries to take his claw out], What the? It's stuck! You gotta help me, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, You've gotta let go of the dime.
,Mr. Krabs:, I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave! ,[SpongeBob pulls on Mr. Krabs from behind a couple times until Mr. Krabs gets thrown back without his arms], Me arms!
,SpongeBob:, Oh no, not again! ,[Mr. Krabs hits the wall, the impact causing the shelf above him to slant and drop a pot, a glass, a pan, a mug, a treasure chest, an anchor, a buoy, and a scuba suit on his head. A giant bump rises up on Mr. Krabs' head and then a dime falls on it causing Mr. Krabs to fall over and blacken out. Scene changes to show an ambulance outside the Krusty Krab and two paramedics start to carry out Mr. Krabs on a stretcher.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait. ,[The paramedics stop moving], Squidward... I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone.
,Squidward:, ,[smiles], You can count on me, sir! ,[The paramedics continue to carry Mr. Krabs out. A third paramedic carries out Mr. Krabs' arms], Take care, Hurry back. Get well soon. You're in our thoughts. ,[The final paramedic enters the ambulance and it drives off.], Takes more muscles to frown than to smile. ,[shuts the door], Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give ,you, a promotion.
,[SpongeBob's pupils form into stars],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Ahh! Really?
,Squidward:, You get to run the cash register.
,SpongeBob:, The cash register... Wow! Squidward, who's gonna work the grill?
,Squidward:, You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier. You'll be wearing ,two, hats now. You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them! ,[puts his hat next to SpongeBob's hat],
,SpongeBob:, Ah... This is the best day of my life.
,Squidward:, Me, too.
,SpongeBob:, But wait, if I'm running the register and the grill, what are you gonna do?
,Squidward:, I've got some very important boss-like errands to run. See ya later. ,[he runs off],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[He is half-way out the door], What is it?
,SpongeBob:, You forgot to teach me how to use... The cash register. ,[He rubs the cash register],
,Squidward:, You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own. ,[walks off as SpongeBob hugs the cash register],
,SpongeBob:, I can't believe this is really happening. ,[sits on the cash register box. He starts to tear up.], Today, I start living! 
,[The scene changes to show Squidward walking outside],
,Squidward:, Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face. ,[scene cuts to Squidward's imagination: Patrick and SpongeBob in the Krusty Krab with dopey looks on their faces],
,Thought Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob!
,Thought SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick!
,Thought Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, could you give me change for a quarter? ,[holds up quarter],
,Thought SpongeBob:, No problem! ,[takes the quarter, bangs on the register until it opens, and gives Patrick a giant pile of money], Here ya go!
,Thought Patrick:, Thanks.
,[the scene goes back to reality],
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh! ,[he runs back to the restaurant, banging the doors open], Sponge... ,[sees only SpongeBob in the Krusty Krab], ...Bob. ,[checks the cash register to see if everything is still there. Gives a sigh of relief],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward. All done with those errands?
,Squidward:, No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar. ,[He pulls out a dollar from his pocket],
,SpongeBob:, Do you want four quarters? ,[holds up four quarters], Or ten dimes? ,[shows ten dimes on his left hand], Or twenty nickels? ,[shows ten nickels on each arm], Or one hundred pennies? ,[shows one-hundred pennies on his back], Or one quarter, three dimes, seven nickels, and ten pennies? ,[shows the quarter on his nose, 3 dimes on his fingers, 7 nickels on his thumb, and ten pennies, in the shape of the cent symbol, on his foot], Or, if you give me a five dollar bill, your options are...
,Squidward:, Alright, goodbye. ,[walks off. Scene changes to show Squidward's house where he comes out wearing sunglasses and blue shorts or bathing suit, he is carrying a lawn chair, a sunbathing mirror, an umbrella hat and a bottle of sunscreen.], This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation. ,[sets his lawn chair down, puts the hat on, puts the mirror down, and puts sunscreen on his nose.], I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah...
,Squidward:, ,[voice over/Thoughts], Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored. ,[imagines SpongeBob behind the counter just standing there. Squidward chuckles.], SpongeBob, bored. ,[he chuckles some more],
,Thought SpongeBob:, Ehh... Gettin' kinda bored. ,[yawns and falls asleep snoring. Krusty Krab spontaneously combusts and Squidward tries to blow it out but it's a thought bubble, so it goes away. Begins to run to the Krusty Krab, but stops.],

SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire. ,[he walks back down the road, chuckling. Then, a fire truck drives down the road from to direction of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is startled and runs to the restaurant with a fire extinguisher. He opens the door and sprays the galley with foam.

,SpongeBob:, May I help you, sir?
,Squidward:, ,[wipes off his foamy beard], It's me, you dunce!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Squidward! ,[mustache falls off], How are those errands going?
,Squidward:, What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm sure you are.
,Squidward:, I don't like your tone.
,SpongeBob:, ,[high-pitched voice], I'm sure you are. ,[normal voice again], How's that?
,Squidward:, Just do your jobs! ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles. ,[puts the spatula in his forehead. Squidward leaves, grumbling.], Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge. ,[The scene changes to show Squidward's house. The scene zooms into the interior. Squidward is trying to sit down.],
,Squidward:, Must... re... ,[cracks his back], ...lax! ,[He slouches in his chair. He pulls out a hand mirror], Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow! Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me: you will not go back to the Krusty Krab. ,[his reflection turns into SpongeBob],
,Mirror SpongeBob:, I will destroy the Krusty Krab! ,[Squidward screams and throws the mirror at the wall while it shatters and runs to the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Have you finished...?
,Squidward:, No! ,[walks out], That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant! ,[walks into his house then runs out towards the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Have you finished those errands? ,[Squidward runs back to his house then back to the Krusty Krab], Have you finished those errands? ,[Squidward runs back to his house], Have you finished those errands? ,[Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab], Have you finished those errands? ,[Squidward keeps running back and forth while SpongeBob is repeating 'have you finished those errands?' Finally, Squidward enters the Krusty Krab and stops], Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?
,Squidward:, No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be, so quit checking up on me! ,[walks up to SpongeBob], I know what you're up to. ,[He hits the cash register while he talks], Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!
,SpongeBob:, But I haven't...
,Squidward:, Okay, ,[He leans on the cash register], maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. ,You, will... ,[He slowly loses his sanity as he walks backwards], And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there! ,[He laughs hysterically and runs away],
,SpongeBob:, Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear ,[Rubs his hats], these hats. 
,[The scene changes to show Squidward locking his door using his key, putting padlocks on it, bolting it down with wood and nails, putting police tape up, and using a blowtorch to weld the door shut so he can't get out],
,Squidward:, There! ,[He throws the blowtorch backwards], Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself! ,[His face looks weird because he has lost his sanity], I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care. ,[laughs], Just gonna... Relax. ,[He walks to his shower, turns on the water, puts on his bathing cap and sits in his bathtub], Let Squid's day off...,[Under the bath water], begin. ,[Squidward hears SpongeBob laughing], ,[above the bath water], What was that? ,[SpongeBob's laughing is heard again], It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me to see if I'm really doing errands. ,[gives a chuckle], But, but he left his post. ,[Gives another chuckle], And I've finally caught him messing up. ,[Gives another chuckle. He pokes his head out the window.], Aha! I caught you, Sponge... ,[notices that it's only the wind making a branch of coral brush against his house], ... Branch. ,[Squidward notices SpongeBob's silhouette with his two hats behind his shower curtain], Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get. ,[pulls the curtain aside], I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a... ,[Sees his toilet with a shampoo bottle and 2 rolls of toilet paper on it], ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward. ,[SpongeBob is in the bathtub with Squidward.], Are you finished with those errands yet? ,[goes under the water],
,Squidward:, Aha! ,[goes under the water and appears as a real octopus with a demonic voice], I know you're in here. ,[gasps], What? ,[SpongeBob is in the drain. He winks and goes down], He's heading back to the Krusty Krab! ,[Jumps out of his bathtub and runs to the door], I'll beat him there! ,[slams through the barricaded door with nothing on but his shower cap and bubbles foaming around his waist], I've got you now, SpongeBob! ,[runs past Sadie who covers her son's eyes with her hand],
,Sadie:, Hey, put some clothes on!
,Squidward:, ,[runs past Patrick lying on a rock], The truth will be revealed!
,Patrick:, ,[stands up], Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward! ,[The scene changes to show the hospital where Purple Doctorfish and Mr. Krabs are walking out],
,Purple Doctorfish:, Okay, Mr. Krabs. Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back. ,[walks inside],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks, Doc. ,[He looks at the street and smiles until the nude and deranged Squidward runs past him],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, you can't beat me! ,[Mr. Krabs frowns, his arms fall off again and he walks back into the hospital. Laughing hysterically, Squidward bursts into Krusty Krab to find SpongeBob already there as he never left], AHA! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! Or the toilet in my bathroom! ,[SpongeBob looks confused and Squidward's saliva hits his face], And then you were in my bathtub, and ,[He slowly regains his sanity], I... and-and you... and I... and then you... swam... down the drain... and... beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, does that mean you're...? ,[Squidward covers SpongeBob's mouth with his hand],
,Squidward:, Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands. ,[hugs the register], I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do. 
,[He rubs his face on the cash register. SpongeBob takes off his clothes (except his underwear) and hands them to Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Whispers], Then you might wanna put these on. ,[Squidward looks down and notices a bunch of bubbles. Close up of his legs and all the bubbles pop except for one, which pops after the close up, he grabs SpongeBob's pants and puts them on.], Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look! ,[walks back with the ""open""/""closed"" sign], We forgot to switch the ""Closed"" sign to ""Open"". ,[flips the sign from ""Closed"" to ""Open""],. It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off! ,[He laughs. Squidward's nose falls off and his head deflates. His whole body soon falls gently to the ground.],

,Potty:, You do know we're rolling, right?
,Patchy:, Oh, whoops. Let's go! ,[honks his horn], Hey, kids. Rush hour traffic here in Encino is really bad. A little music should soothe me jangled nerves.

,[The fume of it floats past Patrick, burning off his eyebrows],
,Patrick:, That looks great! ,[closes his mouth on SpongeBob's hand, and sucks out the sundae. Patrick sighs with relief, but he starts to feel funny, His stomach makes engine spluttering noises], Oh, I gotta go to the restroom! ,[he runs off. Cut to the bathroom, where Patrick and Martin wash their hands at the sink], I'm out of soap, can I borrow- ,[the stench reaches the guy],
,Martin:, Stay back!
,Patrick:, I just want some-

,Martin:, Here! Here's my money! ,[he drops it], Take it! Take it and go away!

,[The fish walk out murmuring. Patrick looks in the mirror.],
,Patrick:, ,[In shock], Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!
,[SpongeBob walks in],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, is everything okay in here? ,[he hears Patrick sobbing. He opens a stall door and sees Patrick sitting on the toilet with a bag over his head], What are you doing in there, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Wouldn't you like to know?
,SpongeBob:, And why is that bag on your head?
,Patrick:, Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly! ,[he whips the bag off. SpongeBob recoils and gasps. Patrick walks out], What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!
,SpongeBob:, Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.
,Patrick:, That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me! ,[his breath reaches SpongeBob and he holds his nose in disgust], I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick...?
,Patrick:, What's my mom gonna say?
,SpongeBob:, ,[plugging his nose], Patrick?
,Patrick:, Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but... ,[SpongeBob screams at Patrick in rage to get his attention and stop his rambling as it works],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! ,[Calmly], You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad. ,[Patrick sighs with relief, his stench in the shape of a skull and crossbones],
,Patrick:, ,[Relaxed],Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...
,SpongeBob:, ,[his eyes water from the foul smell], Arrgh, ,barnacles,, Patrick! What did you eat?!
,Patrick:, Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
,SpongeBob:, No, I mean just this morning.
,Patrick:, Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
,SpongeBob:, What else?
,Patrick:, Well, I had some of your sundae.
,SpongeBob:, Sundae... ,[he whips what's remaining of it out], Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!
,Patrick:, Whatcha mean? ,[SpongeBob coughs as Patrick's breath flies by him],
,SpongeBob:, I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!
,Patrick:, Stink? ,[the two cheer and run around in circles chanting],
,Both:, We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink!
,[The fumes encompass the entire theater and it dissolves to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick run out and run up to Squidward, who is looking through the window of a wig shop],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, guess what, Squidward?
,Both:, We stink! ,[the two hug Squidward, and then run off, still cheering], Oh yeah! We're smelly! I reek! Smell me! ,[the two run off until they're out of sight],

,Sandy:, ,[angry], Some low-life varmint stole my things and broke into my home! My home! I'm going to get that son of a guitar stringer!
,[Sandy puts a coffee pot over her head as makeshift helmet. Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton has made Sandy's pelt into a Sandy Robot. Controlling the robot in a seat in its mouth, he makes it stand up],
,Plankton:, Okay Karen, wish me luck!
,Karen:, ,[referring to the pelt], Repulsive...
,Plankton:, Heh heh. This is going to work like a charm.
,[Sandy Robot stumbles out of Chum Bucket, down the road, and bumps into Larry Lobster],
,Plankton:, ,[speaking through Sandy Robot], Watch where you're standing, coral brains!
,Larry:, Sandy? You don't look so good. Hey, you got to stop eating at the Chum Bucket. That stuff will rot your insides.
,Plankton/Sandy Robot:, Lies, lies! The Chum Bucket will always be my favorite restaurant!
,[Larry bends in close to Sandy],
,Larry:, Sandy, you don't sound like yourself.
,[Plankton closes the pelt's mouth, hiding him from view],
,Plankton:, ,[in a fake Texan accent], No, Sandy is herself. No reason to be sus-pic-ious in any way, y'all.
,[Sandy Robot begins to walk away],
,Larry:, Well, as long as there's no reason to be suspicious.
,Plankton:, ,[to himself, in the robot], That was close. I gotta perfect that Texas drawl.
,[Sandy Robot passes two fish at a bus stop],
,Plankton/Sandy Robot:, Yee-ha! Yee-ha, yee-ha, yee-ha!
,[Sandy Robot smashes through the Krusty Krab's door and passes Harold],
,Plankton/Sandy Robot:, Howdy, partner!
,[Sandy Robot knocks down door to kitchen and walks in],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, you're back!
,Plankton/Sandy Robot:, Yep, that Krabby Patty was so darn good I got to see how y'all make one!
,SpongeBob:, Say, Sandy. You look...different.
,Plankton:, Uh, what are y-y'all talking about, SpongeBob? It's your old pal, in the living fur.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but something about you is different...I just can't put my finger on it.
,Plankton:, ,[to himself], Please don't put your finger on it.
,SpongeBob:, I got it! You're not wearing your spacesuit (diving suit) and helmet!
,Plankton/Sandy Robot:, Uh...yeah. That's...uh...cause...uh...I just breathe underwater now, it's as simple as that.
,SpongeBob:, Let's get cooking!
,[Plankton sighs of relief and SpongeBob brings out a basket of patties, picks up one, and sniffs it],
,SpongeBob:, Ahhh, the gooey freshness that is the Krabby Patty patty.
,Plankton:, Let me stop you there, SquarePants. I'd be much obliged to know how y'all make one of them there patties.
,SpongeBob:, Hohohoho. No can do, buddy. That would require revealing the secret formula. And that is explicitly forbidden as per my current labor contract.
,[SpongeBob shows Sandy robot a packet of paper titled ""Krusty Krab industries Labor Agreement""],
,Plankton:, Yeah, but this is yer old buddy Sandy Cheeks. ,[reads from a Texas Drawl book], Why, you and me are as closer and two catfish in a skillet.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, Sandy, 44-929b specifically prohibits the disclosure of the secret formula to friends, even when those friends are, quote, ""closer and two catfish in a skillet.""
,[SpongeBob shows the Sandy robot section 44-929b],
,Plankton:, ,[to himself], Curse you, Krabs...!
,SpongeBob:, But I can show you all the other ins and outs of making a steamy Krabby Patty. First, I make sure I'm at the comfortable grilling temperature of 274 degrees.
,[SpongeBob sets the grill to 274 degrees],
,SpongeBob:, And we are guh-rillin'.
,Plankton:, An' approximately how long do you cook a patty?
,SpongeBob:, A Krabby Patty is cooked for exactly 283 seconds on each side.
,Plankton:, ,[taking notes], 283 seconds. I can't believe I'm getting all this straight from the source. How could this get any easier?
,[Mr. Krabs bursts through the door and sets the Krabby Patty formula on a table],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm putting the secret Krabby Patty formula out in plain sight.
,[Plankton jumps through the eye holes],
,Plankton:, Yee-haw!
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs stare at the Sandy Robot],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah... anyway, I'm going to leave it out here while I clean out the safe. Don't let it out of your sight, boy-o.
,SpongeBob:, ,[saluting Mr. Krabs], You can always count on me, Mr. K.
,Plankton:, Oh-ho ho, man! That secret formula is as good as mine.
,[Meanwhile, Sandy looks at the town, her panties are covered by a clump of seaweed],
,Sandy:, That no-good who nabbed my pelt surely came here. Probably wanted to cash it in on the Bikini Bottom black market. Well, not if I catch that varmint ( first.
,[Sandy enters the town, and runs into Harold],
,Sandy:, You! You seen anybody in these parts hauling a fur pelt?
,[Harold looks at Sandy's pink, hairless, scantily clad body and laughs hysterically],
,Harold:, Look! A naked chipmunk!
,[More fish gather around Sandy and laugh hysterically],
,Sandy:, Chipmunk?! What is so funny about having my fur stole?
,Random Fish:, Aren't you ashamed of having your pink rat flesh exposed?
,Everyone:, Yeah!
,Sandy:, ,[to herself], With this much attention, that no-good fur thief will see me coming a mile away. I best find something to cover my hind end.
,[Sandy darts into an alley and hides behind some garbage cans. She notices a seaweed bush and rips some seaweed off. She makes the seaweed into a ""grass skirt,"" which she puts on],
,Sandy:, Time to go catch me some skunk!
,[Back at the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Now that we're grilling, we can work on the fixings! See, there are two patties here. But before we get into slicing and dicing we always start with the washing. We'll begin with the seaweed.
,[SpongeBob begins to wash a slice of seaweed, Plankton watches the formula across the table in front of him],
,Plankton:, Okay, I'll stand on that side for a better view.
,SpongeBob:, Okey dokey, but pay close attention, for cleanliness is the public's last defense against a life of horrible disease.
,Plankton:, There it is.
,SpongeBob:, Always ensure that your brush is adequately lathered...always making sure to get both sides...
,Plankton:, That's nice. That's interesting.
,[Sandy Robot reaches for the formula],
,Plankton:, Almost there...
,[SpongeBob is drying the seaweed with a blow dryer],
,SpongeBob:, Then lay it down onto the drying rack and we'll engage our drying phase, hmm.
,[Sandy Robot is about to grab the formula],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy!
,[Sandy Robot turns around],
,Plankton:, ,[Panicky], What, nothing!
,SpongeBob:, Remember, never over dry. Otherwise, the seaweed becomes brittle and cracks.
,[Across town, Sandy is warming her body by a vent, looking around for the thief who took her pelt],
,Sandy:, That dastardly rustler's got to be somewhere in these parts.
,[Sandy's seaweed skirt overheats and shatters into pieces like a mirror, exposing Sandy's purple panties],
,Police:, Hey, look! A hairless goat! [Sandy, while covering her panties with her hands, looks at the police, embarrassed and sheepish]
,[Sandy, embarrassed and humiliated, flees. She runs behind a park bench and a surfboard, covering her panties. Bikini Bottomites point and laughing hysterically, and a reporter takes a picture. Back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is making Sandy Robot finish by putting the top bun on the patty.],
,SpongeBob:, Steady, steady... nice. Oh, you're off-center by 3.6 millimeters. Mmmph, try it again, Sandy.
,Plankton:, ,[to himself], Aaugh! This is getting so tedious!
,Plankton/Sandy Robot:, Maybe you should demonstrate a few more times so I can get the hang of it.
,SpongeBob:, Or, we could address your problem areas directly. Are you struggling with the final wrist flick? Or is your difficulty with the initial transfer move?
,Plankton:, ,[frustrated], Aah!
,[Meanwhile, Sandy, panting, takes refuge in some bushes],
,Sandy:, I'm tired of running. Time to take a stand.
,[Sandy steps out of the bushes. A random fish gasps and turns her baby's stroller away from Sandy],
,Random Fish:, A nudist ferret!
,[Another fish pushes her kids away],
,Fish:, Get in the car, kids!
,Sandy:, It's not my fault! I...
,[An angry crowd pelts Sandy with juice boxes. She dives back into the bushes and notices an open manhole],
,Sandy:, I better go underground.
,[Sandy jumps into the manhole and hides in the sewer, feeling miserable],
,Sandy:, What am I going to do? If I'm ever going to catch this thug, I'm going to need some help.
,[Back at the Krusty Krab, Sandy robot tries to put the bun on again],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, still off by that much. Try it again. ,[Plankton groans, but tries again], Ooh, try again ,[Plankton tries again], Mmm, try again. ,[Plankton tries again], Oh, try again. ,[Plankton tries again], Oh, try again.
,[Plankton tries again],
,SpongeBob:, Eh, try again.
,Plankton:, , [extremely frustrated] Arrrgghh! You, try it again! I'm making my move!
,[Sandy Robot grabs the formula and swallows it],
,Plankton:, It's finally mine! Time to kick this baby into four-paw drive!
,[Sandy Robot runs out of the kitchen on all four feet and legs],
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Sandy! We can work this out!
,[Sandy enters the Krusty Krab through a hole in the floor and immediately notices the Sandy Robot],
,Sandy:, My pelt!
,[SpongeBob rushes out of kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Mr Krabs, Sandy's making off with the formula!
,[Mr. Krabs, dressed like a maid and vacuuming out the safe, rushes over. SpongeBob sees Sandy facing off Sandy Robot],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, you're naked! And you don't have any clothes on!
,Sandy:, Unhand my pelt, you unknown varmint!
,[Plankton pops out Sandy Robot's mouth],
,Plankton:, Only from my cold, dead feelers!
,Sandy:, Plankton! I should have known this was your doing! Now feel ,this,!
,[Sandy punches Sandy Robot],
,Sandy:, Hi-ya!
,[The Sandy Robot is undamaged so Sandy kicks it],
,Sandy:, Pwaaaaa!
,[The Sandy Robot is punched and knocked into the wall and slumps over. Sandy rolls up her pelt and Plankton and the formula flies out. Mr. Krabs catches the formula, Sandy catches Plankton],
,Sandy:, Gotcha! And now for the appropriate punishment for a no-good, yella' belly like yourself.
,[Sandy puts Plankton in a jar of mustard],
,Plankton:, My eye! This condiment is highly irritating to my eye!
,[Sandy's fur pelt is on the ground, Mr. Krabs is shaking its hand],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, thank you, Sandy. Thank you, Sandy.
,[The real Sandy turns around, Her panties are obscured by a Krusty Krab table],
,Sandy:, Uh, sure, Mr. Krabs. ,[The police arrives],
,Police:, We'll take that sicko off your hands.
,Sandy:, Cops! Thank goodness you've come. ,[Sandy holds up the jar of mustard], Take this sicko away!
,Police:, Actually, we're referring to you, ma'am. Public nudity is against the law in this county. ,[The policeman handcuff Sandy's wrist], But don't fret. You'll look just fine in prison orange.
,[Sandy looks at her body and sighs gloomily],

,Genie:, ,[thunder rumbles], So you all like bottles, eh?!
,[The genie uses his powers to grab an empty ketchup bottle from the trashcan. Then he shrinks Squidward, Patrick, Mr. Krabs and Plankton in a smaller size and stuffs them in the bottle as punishment for their greed. He closes the bottle with a lid and drops it on the floor.],

,[The genie snaps his fingers and disappears with his bottle. SpongeBob comes in the kitchen.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, you guys, I—huh? Hmm, guess they worked it out. It's so heartwarming to live in a world with real magic. And the greatest magic of all is the way my friends are so close to each other.

,Squidward:, ,[he notices SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, looking like wrecks, relaxing around their newly-built house of trash], Oh, what did you numbskulls do with the trash?
,SpongeBob:, ,[the camera zooms out to reveal the entire house], Built a house. ,[a table holding a barrel, two pillows, and a photo falls over],
,Squidward:, What the-- why?
,Patrick:, Cause Nick Fishkins bought my home and then he bought SpongeBob's home.
,SpongeBob:, So now we live here.
,Squidward:, Oh, why didn't you just use the money that Nick Fishkins gave you to rent a room or buy a new home?
,Patrick:, Well, he hasn't paid us yet!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, he said it right on the TV, ""I wanna buy your home!"" But we haven't seen any money!
,Squidward:, Ohhh... let me get this straight. You saw a TV commercial of Nick Fishkins saying he would buy your home and without meeting him or signing anything, you believe your homes have been sold? Now doesn't that seem weird, even to you?
,Patrick:, Really weird!
,Squidward:, Oh, listen you dumb-- ,[Squidward stops talking, and realizes that SpongeBob and Patrick moving out is positive. He imagines himself in front of his house, forming a rainbow that destroys SpongeBob and Patrick's homes. After this, he makes a creepy smile], Uh, you know, looks like you guys got ,Fishkinned,, and well, there's nothing you can do about that! ,[chuckles],
,[transition to the next day, at dawn, where a clam is seen crowing like a rooster. SpongeBob wakes up in his ""bed,"" drinks from a thrown-out soup can, and takes a ""shower,"" which is actually Patrick dumping more trash on SpongeBob. After this, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Ready for work, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sees SpongeBob looking like a wreck], Wait a minute! What's the matter with you, boy? ,[view shows SpongeBob looking like a mess once again], You look like you slept in a pile of trash!
,SpongeBob:, A pile-of-trash house! Patrick and I built one out back with all your garbage!
,Mr. Krabs:, With my garbage? On my land?! I'll be chargin' ye a reasonable rental fee.
,SpongeBob:, ,[shocked], How much?
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm... your paycheck oughtta cover it!
,SpongeBob:, Gee, I didn't know being homeless was so expensive.
,[transition to Squidward in his cashier boat],
,Squidward:, ,[checking his watch], Ah, work is done! ,[puts his hat in his pocket], Now I can go home to a SpongeBob-free zone and rearrange my doily collection!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up to Squidward], I miss the old neighborhood! I think I'm gonna visit my old house tonight!
,Squidward:, Uh, no, no, you don't wanna do that!
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Squidward:, Well, a family has moved in there, with a lot of kids, and they don't like to be disturbed.
,SpongeBob:, How many's a lot?
,Squidward:, Oh, like, pfft, 12 kids!
,SpongeBob:, But if I just ask politely to visit do you think they--
,Squidward:, And they don't speak English! Uh, the Fishtraps only speak... German!
,[SpongeBob, saddened by this, deflates],
,Patrick:, ,[on a table eating garbage], Maybe I can move in with whoever's in my house.
,Squidward:, No, no, no, uh, a band lives there now!
,Patrick:, A rock band?
,Squidward:, Um, yes.
,Patrick:, Cause my house is a rock?
,Squidward:, Yes, a big rock band with like eight people and all sorts of musical equipment so there's only room for musicians! ,[he leaves the Krusty Krab after responding],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I could learn German!
,Patrick:, And I could learn what ""learn"" is.
,[transition to Squidward's house at night. Inside, Squidward is reading a magazine while relaxing music plays on his record player],
,Squidward:, Mmmm, nice! Ah, it's like a beautiful dream! So peaceful, no more aggravation! ,[he hears someone knocking on SpongeBob's pineapple. He looks outside and sees SpongeBob], What is that porous terror up to now? Oh no, he's expecting a big family that speaks German! ,[Squidward runs into his closet, grabs supplies, and runs to SpongeBob's house. He opens SpongeBob's door, dressed in a Tyrolean hat and lederhosen], Uh, German, hallo?
,SpongeBob:, Ach! Guten Morgen! Mein Name ist SpongeBob! (Oh! Good morning! My name is SpongeBob!)
,Squidward:, Say what?
,SpongeBob:, Guten Morgen! Mein Name ist SpongeBob! Ich bin gekommen, um mein alte Heimat besuchen. (Good morning! My name is SpongeBob! I have come to visit my old home.)
,Squidward:, Uh, please, vould you speaken-zee English, I need za bractize!
,SpongeBob:, Huh? Oh, ja, I mean, sure, good morning! My name is SpongeBob, what is your name?
,Squidward:, Umm... Gerhard.
,SpongeBob:, Well, hello, Gerhard, I used to live here. Just stopped by to visit my old home.
,Squidward:, Ach, meine Neptune, uh, now is nein such a good time mit the wife and zuch!
,SpongeBob:, ,[while Patrick is walking behind SpongeBob], Wife? Where is she?
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob.
,Squidward:, ,[panicked], She's shy... well, I must be going! Mein wifenz calling me for zupper! She is a fine Gutenchef of Fudenschlop!
,SpongeBob:, Um, would you mind if I stay for zupper? ,[SpongeBob enters his pineapple], Whatchya having?
,Squidward:, Umm... kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz.
,SpongeBob:, Kerglooginpfiefer, that's my favorite! Uh, what's your wife's name?
,Squidward:, I don't know... Hedvig! ,[Squidward grabs SpongeBob and puts him into his chair], Dunt movin! Not a schtepp! ,[SpongeBob tries to get out of the chair, but Squidward rushes and stops him before he could], Nein, nein! No moven sie! Sitz! ,[Squidward rushes back to his house, grabs more supplies, and rushes inside to Patrick's house. Patrick knocks on his rock, and Squidward open it, dressed as a rock star], Hey, man, like, what's happening?
,Patrick:, I missed my house, and I was hoping I could move back in.
,Squidward:, Oh, sorry, dude, no room. This place is, like, filled with band members and musical instruments.
,Patrick:, What do you play?
,Squidward:, Oh, pfft, the electric clarinet.
,Patrick:, There's no such thing!
,Squidward:, ,[a little nervous], Sure there is.
,Patrick:, Prove it!
,Squidward:, I'll be right back! ,[Squidward runs back to his house, grabs his clarinet, attaches a speaker into it, grabs more musical equipment, then runs back to Patrick's house. The camera then zooms over to SpongeBob sitting in his chair],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gerhard! Are you coming back?
,Squidward:, ,[pops up behind Patrick's rock, and sneaks back to SpongeBob's pineapple, still in his rock band outfit],
,SpongeBob:, Hello! ,[SpongeBob gets out of his chair and shakes Squidward's hand], You must be Hedvig!
,Squidward:, Hedvig? ,[now pretending to be Hedvig], Oh, oh yeah, that's me, Hedvig!
,SpongeBob:, I have heard so much about your kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz! Can't wait to try it.
,Squidward:, One-- ,[in Hedvig's voice], One second! ,[Squidward grabs a trash can full of garbage, dumps it onto a plate, and gives it to SpongeBob], Tonight's zupper is to go, so please, to go!
,SpongeBob:, Well aren't your twelve little German children gonna sing for me while I eat?
,Squidward:, I don't have children! ,[realizing what he said], I mean- I mean, yeah, yeah, outside please! ,[Squidward pushes SpongeBob outside],
,SpongeBob:, I love outdoor concerts.
,[Squidward closes SpongeBob's door and rushes back to Patrick's house. He opens the rock to reveal himself playing an ""electric"" clarinet. Patrick is satisfied by this],
,Squidward:, Uh, groovy enough for ya, man?
,Patrick:, That was great! You should give lessons to my ex-neighbor, Squidward! He stinks!
,[Squidward growls, closes Patrick's rock, and then runs back to SpongeBob's house. Patrick itches his back and walks to SpongeBob's front entrance, where he sees SpongeBob.],
,Patrick:, What's going on?
,SpongeBob:, Shhh! The Fishtrap children are gonna sing!
,Squidward:, ,[with puppets on his tentacles], ♪Ve are der little kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, ve are der little kiddievinks, ve love to sing all day!♪
,SpongeBob:, ,[eating part of his ""ker gloupen veisher mit schvodenberryclabasous""], I think the littlest kiddywink is off-key.
,Patrick:, They need a band. I'll go talk to the guys that live in my old place, and see if they can come over to play along!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah!
,Squidward:, ,[frustrated by this], That's it, I'm done! ,[he takes off his wig and puppets],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward!? What are you doing in the Fishtraps' house?
,Squidward:, You idiots! It's not the Fishtraps' house, it's your house, and that is still Patrick's house! You just saw a commercial-- that's all!
,Patrick:, So... is Nick Fishkins gonna live in my house?
,Squidward:, ,[stops growling], He doesn't live in the houses he buys.
,SpongeBob:, Well if he doesn't live in them, what does he do with them?
,Squidward:, He flips the houses, you dimwits! He buys houses then resells them for a profit! He flips houses for a living!
,Patrick:, He flips houses for a living?
,Squidward:, Yes! And I'm calling Nick Fishkins right now to come over and flip my house, so I can move away! ,[walks away mumbling angrily],
,SpongeBob:, Poor Squidward. We should do something really nice for him!
,Patrick:, ,[gets an idea], I know!
,[the scene transitions to SpongeBob and Patrick each holding one end of Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, Alright, Patrick! On the count of three! One... two... three! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick flip over Squidward's house on its side, while Squidward is screaming inside. His house proceeds to fall upside down. Then, Nick Fishkins pulls up],
,Nick:, Say, is this the home of Squidward Tentacles? The one that was for sale?
,SpongeBob:, Sure is!
,Nick:, Yeesh. This place is a wreck! I'm Nick Fishkins and I do not wanna buy this home! Not sold! ,[a sign reading ""NOT SOLD!"" appears in front of Nick. He then drives away],
,Squidward:, ,[coming out from the top of his flipped home], What happened?
,SpongeBob:, We flipped your house for ya.
,Squidward:, Who's that driving away?
,Patrick:, That was Nick Fishkins.
,Squidward:, And what did he say?
,Patrick:, He said ""Yeesh! Who'd wanna live in that thing? Not sold!""
,Squidward:, I... I can't believe you did that!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick return to their homes],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, You're welcome!

,SpongeBob:, ♪Oh, I've got an whole new attitude♪
,Squidward:, Oh, is that supposed to be singing? ,[paint brushes fall on the floor], I am putting that one on SpongeBob. ,[to SpongeBob], Would you clam up, SpongeBob? I am trying to paint in here!
,SpongeBob:, ♪I cherish my fellow residents...♪
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, why are you doing this?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm just displaying for all to see an attitude of gratitude!
,Squidward:, Gratitude? You've been wallowing in filth all morning. What could you possibly be grateful for?
,SpongeBob:, Hit it, boys! ,[Slimy trash can monsters appear],♪Oh, I've got an whole new attitude. A lifetime subscription to gratitude. Friend, you've got to change your latitude.

,Slimy trash can monsters:, You'll see.

,Squidward:, Keep your hat and your gratitude! Because having you as a neighbor has left me with nothing to be grateful for! ,[slips on the paintbrushes and falls downstairs, bursting a pipe],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Squidward, you should really consider getting your plumbing looked at.
,Squidward:, This is your fault!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, buddy. I can give you a hand.
,Squidward:, No, you have helped me enough. I don't want your help ever again!
,SpongeBob:, No problem, pal. ,[walks away],

,Squidward:, Ha ha ha.
,Scooter:, I knew you would eventually get it, dude.,[laughs. SpongeBob is looking at Squidward],
,Squidward:, Stop staring, SpongeBob. You're affecting my productivity.
,Sandals:, I would like to order one Krabby Patty.
,Squidward:, That'll will be three dollars.
,Sandals:, ,[with many pennies], Do you accept pennies?
,Squidward:, I don't have time to count all that!

,SpongeBob:, What's the matter, Squidward? Don't you have an attitude of gratitude?
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], SpongeBob, I hate my job, and I live in a dead end town with neighbors I can't stand. I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! What do I have to be thankful for?

,SpongeBob:, Sorry to interrupt your crying, Mr. Krabs, but shouldn't we get to a place that at least doesn't have a roof with lava coming through it? ,[everyone evacuates], Fear not, shelter can't be far a-
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, why even bother, SpongeBob? Can't you see? Civilization as we know is crumbling to dust! ,[a hideous close-up is shown], Civic orders is in tatters. It's every man for himself, there's no other way. I'm gonna need your life essence! ,[grabs SpongeBob and Squidward],

,[Cut to a building with a sign reading, ""Volcano Shelter"" on it. Inside, citizens argue angrily.],

,[a member of the crowd angrily smashes the nameplate that reads ""MAYOR"".],
,Billy:, What are we gonna do?
,Mayor:, Don't worry. We've got it under control.
,Billy:, ,[jerks on the mayor], Under control? Half the city's on fire! You call THAT under control? Huh? Do ya? ,[the two of the police fish take him away], The end is near, Mayor.
,Harold:, That guy's on to something. What are you hiding from us, Mayor? Do you have some secret? Is the end near?

,SpongeBob:, Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, please. I've got something.
,Mayor:, Oh! Yes, boy? How do you propose we stop the volcano?
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out parking tickets], Actually, I just had a question about these parking tickets. I don't have a car.
,Squidward:, Oh, boy. Moron.
,Mayor:, We're doomed!

,Dolphin Warrior:, ,[laughs], You fools!
,[,The crowd of Bikini Bottom citizens looks at the dolphin flying on his staff. He lands on behind the mayor's desk.],
,Mayor:, Who are you?
,Dolphin Warrior:, ,[laughing], I am an ancient warrior from long ago. The last of my kind who ruled over the ocean from before the dawn of time. But, alas, my people were wiped out by the same volcano that plagues you now.
,Harold:, Then how did you survive?
,Dolphin Warrior:, ,[laughs], I survived, because I was the only one who knew how to stop it!
,Harold:, Well, don't keep us in suspense. How did you stop it?
,Dolphin Warrior:, You must make... a sacrifice!
,[everyone gasps],
,Harold:, What kind of sacrifice?
,Dolphin Warrior:, A sacrifice must be made of the most miserable person.
,Harold:, I knew it! We have to sacrifice the most miserable person!
,Monica:, And who would that be?
,Harold:, Well, it certainly isn't me! ,[The crowd of citizens argues, pointing at each other. We look at SpongeBob, Squidward, and Krabs, as the citizens continue pointing at each other.],

,Man:, Oh, oh, we're idiots now! Oh, nice! Nice!
,Woman:,  I'm a solitary smart woman.

,Squidward:, What?
,Male Fish:, ,[The mob of citizens angrily carrying Squidward marches to the volcano.], Miserable Squidward! Oh, you ,are ,miserable!

,Mabel:, And my teeth! ,[points to the fish from earlier a hat], And his hat!
,Scooter:, And you called your pipe stupid.

,Mayor:, Sorry, Mr. Tentacles. Throw him in, fellas.
,Squidward:, No!
,SpongeBob:, Wait! It was I who makes Squidward miserable. Throw me in instead.
,Mayor:, Works for me.

,Squidward:, Well, I'm glad that y'all came to your senses. Bunch of ingrates. Come on, SpongeBob. Jump in. ,[Squidward steps on the ledge; it breaks and Squidward falls and holds on to other ledges],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[screams], SpongeBob, help!
,SpongeBob:, I'd love to, Squidward, but you said to not help you ever again! And that being my neighbor left you with nothing to be grateful for. I made a promise!
,Squidward:, I take it back! ,[screaming], Please, SpongeBob, I didn't mean any of that! I do appreciate your friendship. I am grateful. I'm... I'm... ,[cries], I'm grateful for the life I'm living!

,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs him], Squidward, I always knew you felt that way. ,[pulls him up], Aw, buddy. Thanks for finally opening up to us.
,[the pipe at Squidward's house bursts causing it to fall into the volcano. everyone except Squidward cheers],
,Squidward:, My house!
,Dolphin Warrior:, Ah, now the volcano is appeased!
,Squidward:, But I thought you said a sacrifice had to be made of the most miserable person.
,Dolphin Warrior:, ,[chuckles], No! You didn't let me finish. I was trying to say, a sacrifice of the most miserable person's house. No one ever listens to me. ,[laughs as he flies away on his scepter],
,Squidward:, You know, SpongeBob, in light of everything that just happened... I lied to you. I am not grateful for anything! I mean look at me. I don't even have a roof to sleep under, anymore!

Then he hears a crash from outside and frowns; the sculpture does as well],

,Squidward:, I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop. ,[SpongeBob stops], Now, play me an elaborate song with this! ,[gives SpongeBob a tissue],
,SpongeBob:, But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
,Squidward:, Oh, my. Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo. ,[SpongeBob blows through the tissue to try and get it to make music],
,SpongeBob:, I can't do it!
,Squidward:, ,[stands up], Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, 'cause you're not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song. ,[walks away. Day turns into night and into day again and SpongeBob is lying on the ground with the tissue on his nose], What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
,Patrick:, ,[comes back with the pie], I found it. ,[Squidward takes it],
,Squidward:, I'll take that! ,[throws pie in Patrick's face],
,Patrick:, Yes, your ghostliness! ,[licks filling off his face], This is fun.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, are you ready for this?
,Patrick:, Yes. ,[SpongeBob walks a couple steps forward],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? ,[Patrick is facing the wrong way],
,Patrick:, Yes.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, it's this way.
,Patrick:, Where?
,SpongeBob:, Here.
,Patrick:, ,[turns around], Oh, coming! ,[both enter a room in the back with a bunch of junk in it], How are we going to clean up all this mess?
,SpongeBob:, It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! ,[tears the wall],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Oh look, you missed some. ,[SpongeBob picks up a book],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman. ,[shows picture in the book], It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
,Patrick:, We're going to go shopping?
,SpongeBob:, No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. ,[Squidward is laying on the couch, SpongeBob & Patrick spit spitballs at him],
,Squidward:, Ow, what the heck was that?
,SpongeBob:, Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
,Squidward:, Ceremony for what?
,SpongeBob:, We're going to put you to rest.
,Squidward:, I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Squidward:, Well, I'm going to go check. ,[walks off. Opens door and screams because he sees Patrick & SpongeBob with a coffin],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, get in.
,Squidward:, Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing.
,SpongeBob:, But you said we could put you to rest.
,Squidward:, I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
,[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick outside ],
,Squidward:, Now what? ,[Squidward sees SpongeBob writing on a tombstone],
,SpongeBob:, I wrote “Here lies Squidward”. You may not remember him, but... ,[Squidward screams], Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! ,[turns back to Squidward], Cut that out!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. ,[a bus with a load of people are in front of Squidward's house],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
,SpongeBob:, No, just into this hole.
,Squidward:, ,[Groans then sighs], SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. ,[Takes off his night cap],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], You're bald?
,Squidward :, No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
,SpongeBob:, But-
,Squidward:, Do it!
,SpongeBob:, Go home. ,[People get back on bus sadly], But, Master--
,Squidward:, I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, As you wish, master.
,Squidward:, D'oh!
,Patrick:, Boy, he really had us fooled.
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
,Patrick:, You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, say that again.
,Patrick:, That again?
,SpongeBob:, No, the other thing.
,Patrick:, No, the other thing.
,SpongeBob:, ,[annoyed], No, what you said before when you...
,Patrick:, No, what you said before when you..
,SpongeBob:, Never mind. I've got an idea.
,Patrick:, Never mind! I've got an idea. ,[SpongeBob gets annoyed again. Later, Squidward is reclining on his chair outside. SpongeBob is trying to blow a bubble big enough to get Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, I can't reach him!
,Patrick:, Blow harder. ,[SpongeBob blows a big bubble to consume Squidward. The bubble lifts Squidward gently from his chair. The octopus doesn't notice that he's floating.], There he goes!
,SpongeBob:, Isn't he beautiful?
,Patrick:, How high's he going to go? ,[Squidward sees he's floating],
,SpongeBob:, All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond. ,[both of them wave to Squidward], Goodbye, friend.
,Patrick:, Happy trails! ,[Squidward pounds his fists on the bubble and tries to yell, but his voice is so distorted by the soapy wall that unintelligible muffled noises come through.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, You're welcome!
,SpongeBob:, He's on the other side now.
,Patrick:, Yeah. ,[Squidward is floating above the sea at Bikini Atoll island in a bubble], He's in a better place. ,[Squidward moans in the bubble with seagulls flying around him],

"[A beautiful day in Bikini Bottom. A car leaves and pieces of asphalt fly into Squidward's face],
,Squidward:, Ahh.. What a day!
,[Squidward singing and enters the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob accidentally hits Squidward with the door],
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, Krusty Krab! ,[notices Squidward], Oh.. Sorry, Squidward! Didn't see ya there!
,Squidward:, ,[Still smiling], Not a problem, SpongeBob, not a problem at all!
,Mr. Krabs:, Specials? We don't have specials! ,[Scratches the slateboard while people can't stand the screeching sound except Squidward],
,Squidward:, Good morning, sir! Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
,Thaddeus:, Uh... I'll think I'll have a Krabby Patty.
,[His bad breath punches Squidward, plugs his nose, and he is still happy],
,Squidward:, One Krabby Patty coming up!
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, you're in a chipper mood this morning, did you get an order of fancy decorative soaps in the mail or somethin'?
,Squidward:, Even better, I have a clarinet recital immediately after work today! So ain't nothing gonna ruin my day.
,[Nazz's baby accidentally squirts her milk from his bottle onto Squidward's clarinet box],
,Nazz:, Oh, terribly sorry, sir.
,Squidward:, No need! See? Not a drop!
,[Nazz's baby drools onto Squidward's clarinet],
,Squidward:,  ,[Finally snaps], Grr.. I can't take this any more!
,Mr. Krabs:, I told you, there's no early-bird special, now stop calling me here-- Mother!
,Squidward:, This is unacceptable!
,Mr. Krabs:, What?
,Squidward:, This! ,[points to his clarinet],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice to have ya back, Squidward.
,Squidward:, This is an outrage! I no longer tolerate my personal items being soiled by the ravels that crawls in this restaurant! I demand a place to put my stuff!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm.. Okay, uhhh. I suppose you could put it with the nacho cheese, no one's got near that in years.
,Squidward:, You ever read this? ,[Hands out a book],
,Mr. Krabs:, Bikini Bottom Labor Regulations? Eewww! Gross! ,[grows hives], Get that thing away from me! It's giving me hives!
,Squidward:, It specifically states that all employers must provide his or her employees with a secure, clean place to store personal property.
,Mr. Krabs:, Gahh! Blast you, Squidward! You drive a hard bargain. I guess I could rustle something up for ya.
,[patties sizzling],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah... Sizzle those juices.
,[Krabs brings a rusty locker],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! Here we go! Found it!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, what is it?

,Mr. Krabs:, It's me old navy locker. Good as new! ,[opens and shows bones of Corporal Sterling],
,SpongeBob:, Who is that, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[as he empties the locker], uuhh.. Appears to be Corporal Sterling, lad. Heh...forgot all about that prank. ,[he empties the locker], Squidward! Your locker is ready!
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! Do we share our lockers like we share hairnets?
,Squidward:, Not at a whale's age.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now not so fast, Mr. Squidward, the law requires that all employees have a secure place for personal items. So you are required by law, to share.
,Squidward:, Ohh, I suppose I can share but only since it requires by law. Hey! This thing is filthy! You don't expect me to clean it?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[with a bucket of water and duster], No he doesn't! And I don't either!
,[dusts the locker, Squidward and Krabs cough due to dust, opens door, absorbs the water and blasts it onto the locker, the locker looks good as new],
,Mr. Krabs:, Blimey! She hasn't sparkled like this since boot camp! Carry on boys.
,Squidward:, Impressive indeed. Just keep your grubby little hands to your side.
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Squidward. Finally I have a clean place to store my toothbrush.
,Squidward:, Just don't touch my clarinet!
,SpongeBob:, I promise nothing untoward will happen.
,[Shuts locker. Rings bell],
,Squidward:, Order up, SpongeBob! ,[walk towards SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing? You're supposed to be fry cooking. I told you not to touch my stuff!
,SpongeBob:, I didn't! I wore protective gloves! And besides, don't you like how classy it look now?
,Squidward:, Velvet..
,SpongeBob:, Now I'd like to stand by and idly chat with you, Squidward, But I must attend to my Krusty Krab duties! In the future, please keep your interruptions to a minimum, sir, please!
,[SpongeBob comes in with a load of appliances],
,Squidward:, And here's your change, ma’am.
,Squidward:, What is that idiot doing now?! ,[throws change on ground],
,Customer:, Loose change! ,[People starts collect as Mr. Krabs bursts out and yells like a gorilla to scare them away],
,Squidward:, I hope you're not trying to shove the boxes into that locker!
,SpongeBob:, Too late! It's already done.
,Squidward:, If you smashed my clarinet-- so help me, Neptune-- I will ,[opens locker],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward, there's plenty of room!
,[Squidward walks inside the locker room],
,SpongeBob:, I... expanded a bit.
,Squidward:, Well, it's all fine and dandy, but where's my clarinet?
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's simple
,SpongeBob:, We just simply consult the card catalog and find.. Squidward's Clarinet drawer 36●8-B ,[opens cabinet and reveals Squidward's clarinet],
,SpongeBob:, See?
,Squidward:, Fine. But remember, It's vitally important that nothing happens to it
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, buddy! ,[slams drawer shut],

,Squidward:, SpongeBob?!
,Squidward:, 1018●2-E.
,Squidward:, Another note?!
,SpongeBob:, Oops! Did I say 1018●2-E? I meant 2019●3-F! Sorry!

,Eagle:, I am the keeper of the horned forest, state your business here.
,Squidward:, uuhh.. I'm.. trying to find my clarinet.
,Eagle:, Your clarinet?
,Squidward:, Yes, my clarinet! Which I am the proud owner.
,[Eagle laughs],
,Eagle:, A clarinet is not owned. Why don't you tell me why you're really here?
,Squidward:, You calling me a liar?!
,[Eagle grabs Squidward with his tongue],
,Eagle:, I don't appreciate your tone.
,Squidward:, I'm sorry I-I-I didn't mean to offend you.
,Eagle:, This is a sacred place where clarinets live without persecution. You need to learn respect.
,Squidward:, ,[Eagle squeezed squidward tightly], I've learned.. ,[loosely], I've learned respect...
,Eagle:, I don't believe you.

,Squidward:, ha ha! Wha the- SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
,[SpongeBob laughs hanging down from a hole, as SpongeBob disappears, it vanishes. The Squidward in the two mirrors gets his clarinet and shoves it in the mouth, playing a high pitched note Squidward can't stand..

,Patrick:, I win! I win!

The scene changes to show a wide shot of Bikini Bottom. Snow is shown falling.], for tropical, undersea life.
,[It starts to snow harder. Eventually, Bikini Bottom is blanketed in show. Johnny Elaine appears wearing a snow hat.],
,Johnny Elaine:, Yes, it seems Old Man Winter paid us a visit late last night, and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet, ,[A street in downtown Bikini Bottom is shown.], but a blanket... a blanket of snow! ,[Jellyfish Fields and its sign are shown covered in snow.], Yes, from Jellyfish Fields... ,[A jellyfish floats by.

,Johnny Elaine:, And local residents are taking notice! ,[SpongeBob and Gary put on their Santa hats.],
,[The scene pans through Jimmy Gus making a snow fish, a snow whale, two kids making a snow mermaid, and Mr. Krabs making a snow dollar. The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff walking to her boat. She puffs up and blows the snow off. She gets in and drives past the show that was previously on her boat. Fred pops out and shakes his ""fist"".],
,Fred:, Hey!
,[A wide shot of the Chum Bucket is shown. A close shot of the doors is shown. Plankton opens the door.],
,Plankton:, ,[walks outside the Chum Bucket], What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world! ,[He laughs evilly, but a bunch of snow falls on top of him.], Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you! ,[he is now buried in snow.],

He looks behind him to see a circle.], Oh... ,[a snowball hits him in the side of the head], Hey! ,[SpongeBob whistles], Thanks a lot, SpongeBob!

,Patrick:, Yeah. ,[SpongeBob laughs. Patrick runs over to SpongeBob], This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.

Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge. ,[he picks up the lemon wedge, then squirts lemon juice in his eye, which is now twitching], Why do I even bother? ,[Banging is heard outside.

,Squidward:, I most certainly am not!
,SpongeBob:, Then that means he's on my side!
,Squidward:, No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level. ,[drops the snowball], If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it. ,[walks back inside and slams the door],
,Patrick:, Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!

What's this? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are shaking hands], Wha... I... no! ,[walks back outside], What are you doing? You're supposed to be ,[punches the right side of his head], knocking each other's brains out!
,SpongeBob:, We signed a peace treaty, Squidward. ,[Patrick shows treaty], You were right, fighting is for children.
,Squidward:, No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty! ,[rips the treaty into pieces], There! Let the war continue!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty.
,Squidward:, Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, And who am I?
,Squidward:, You're Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, Can I be Mr. Krabs?
,Squidward:, No! Wait, why?
,SpongeBob:, He's a good leader.
,Squidward:, Would you butt out?!
,Patrick:, Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!
,Squidward:, I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick! ,[Squidward throws a snowball at Patrick's eyes], Now, what are you going to do? ,[Patrick throws it back at Squidward hitting his eyes], Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?
,Patrick:, You said ,you, were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[imitating Mr. Krabs], Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! ,[laughs in his regular voice],
,Squidward:, ,[silently], Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...
,SpongeBob:, If you're in this war, then where's your fort?
,Squidward:, I don't have one, okay? Now...
,Patrick:, You got to have a fort, Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, Forts win wars, Squidward.
,Squidward:, ,[growls], Okay, fine! You want a fort? ,[makes a small snow fort], There. There's your fort! Now...
,Patrick:, Your fort's too small, Squidward.
,Squidward:, It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...
,SpongeBob:, He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.
,Squidward:, Trust me, it's fine. ,[Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward. He wipes the snow off his face],
,SpongeBob:, See, it is too small.
,Squidward:, Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down. ,[crouches down], See? Down here, I am perfectly... ,[Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Exposed.
,Squidward:, Would you two please... ,[Patrick throws a snowball at Squidward], ...stop throwing... ,[Patrick throws another snowball at Squidward], ...snowballs?! ,[Patrick pauses and throws another snowball at Squidward. Squidward growls and retaliates with a snowball of his own but it puts out his fireplace yet again],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Squidward returned fire!
,Patrick:, Then it's war!
,Squidward:, No-no... no, wait, wait, wait! ,[crouches down behind his snow fort], I was just giving a demonstration! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick throw lots of snowballs at Squidward. Squidward ends up looking like a snowman from all the snowballs that hit him. A hat then falls on his head. He then growls and breaks out of the snowman], All right, that's it! You guys asked for it! ,[throws a snowball at SpongeBob], I got him! Ha! I got him! ,[laughs], In your face, SpongeBob! ,[laughs], This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], He got you good, SpongeBob! ,[Squidward throws a snowball at Patrick and then throws lots of snowballs at SpongeBob and Patrick], Take cover! ,[they crouch down as Squidward continues to throw snowballs],
,Squidward:, ,[as he throws snowballs and laughs], Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah... ,[he starts to throw snowballs rapidly], Incoming! ,[SpongeBob peeps up and Patrick approaches him, showing his belly button frozen],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I think Squidward's taking this really seriously. ,[Squidward's clarinet is wedged in Patrick's forehead], That last one had his clarinet in it.
,SpongeBob:, Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B. ,[they both tiptoe away while Squidward continues to throw snowballs. He eventually stops and pants],
,Squidward:, What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire. ,[notices his fort is a little lopsided and gasps], What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me! ,[grabs more snow and pats it down], I'll just fix that right now. ,[laughs], Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. ,[grabs more snow and pats some more on the north side], Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner! ,[he pats snow on the back of the fort], There... Ha-ha! ,[gasps], But what about the possibility of an aerial attack! ,[starts digging more snow on his fort. Scene cuts to a few seconds later where Squidward has a gigantic fort, near the top of the tree], I guess that ought to do it! ,[laughs wildly], Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable! ,[laughs more], Now, where are those fools? ,[snow falls on Squidward's head], Ha! The first shot has been fired! ,[throws a snowball while more snow falls on his head], Take this, Patrick! ,[throws another snowball as more snow falls on Squidward], Taste my frozen fury! ,[throws two snowballs. Zooms out to show the snow from a tree is falling on Squidward's head], Victory is mine! ,[laughs wildly], Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now! ,[Squidward keeps throwing snowballs while SpongeBob and Patrick are watching TV and sipping some cocoa],
,SpongeBob:, Did you hear something, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Nope.
,Man on TV:, Get out the snowshoes and the shovels.

"[SpongeBob walks up to Patrick with a package in his hand],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, look. I got my... ,[he notices Patrick has the same package. He unwraps his to show a reef blower. Patrick unwraps his to show a flower vase. SpongeBob laughs], I'm sorry, Patrick. ,[he wipes away a tear from his laugh], It's just for a second I thought... ,[notices Patrick has the same reef blower as he does],
,Patrick:, Hey, you got the same reef blower as me! ,[Patrick blows at SpongeBob], Tag, you're it. ,[SpongeBob laughs. Both run around tagging each other. Patrick blows away a can while SpongeBob blows away a sand sculpture of himself. Patrick switches the blower to 'suck' and sucks off the lines of SpongeBob's pineapple],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you made my house sparkling clean.
,Patrick:, Sure did.
,SpongeBob:, We haven't improved Squidward's day yet. Let's do his house! ,[Patrick sucks up the nose on Squidward's house and laughs], My turn. ,[SpongeBob sucks up one of the windows. Squidward opens up the other window],
,Squidward:, What is going on out here?
,SpongeBob:, We're playing with our new reef blowers!
,Squidward:, Playing with a reef blower? That is the most childish thing I have ever heard of.
,SpongeBob:, But it's fun!
,Squidward:, Fun?! How could playing with one of those over-sized hair dryers possibly be fun?
,Patrick:, Like this... ,[Patrick sucks the window up. Squidward pulls his nose out of the wall],
,Squidward:, ,[rubs his nose], Chafed. ,[opens his front door], Alright, that's...! ,[Squidward's words are cut as Patrick sucks up the door],
,SpongeBob:, Let's do your house, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Yeah! ,[the two walk to Patrick's rock, and they see Squidward digging a hole up to the surface, seeing as how he couldn't exit his house any other way. He jumps out of it, fuming],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, you're steaming! You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter.
,Squidward:, Put my windows back!
,SpongeBob:, No problem, Squidward! We're on your side! ,[the two set their blowers to 'Blow' and aim at Squid's house], Any second now… ,[all the items fly out of the hoses at once and blow Squidward's house to pieces. Debris falls everywhere],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, this is the final straw. I am going to move so far away, that I will be able to brag about it. I would- ,[he is hit on the head with a rock], I would rather tear out my brain stem, carry it into the middle of the nearest four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than go on living where I do now! ,[the TV falls to the ground and turns on. On the television is an octopus, who looks like Squidward, but with a hair piece. He is in a suit and stands in front of a rainbow],
,TV Octopus:, Hi there! Is this the final straw? Do you want to move so far away, that you can brag about it? Would you rather tear out your brain stem, walk out into the middle of the nearest three-way-
,Squidward:, Four-way!
,TV Octopus:, Four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than continue living where you do now? Then move to- ,[the screen goes to static, as Patrick has changed the channel with a remote],
,Patrick:, I hate this channel.
,Squidward:, No! No! ,[he grabs the remote and changes it back],
,TV Octopus:, -Tentacle Acres! Where happiness is just a suction cup away! ,[he puts his tentacles together and pops them. The pops echo. Cut to a large complex, fenced off. There is a golden door, and above it is the sign ""Tentacle Acres."" Squidward walks to the door, with his clarinet and a few other things. He talks into the intercom on the door],
,Squidward:, Hello?
,Guard:, Yes, can I help you?
,Squidward:, I'm here about the happiness. I'll be moving in now.
,Guard:, Are you alone?
,Squidward:, No. I mean, yes. There's nobody with me. Yes, peace and quiet.
,Guard:, Are you now, or have you ever been, a sponge?
,Squidward:, No.
,Guard:, What about a-
,Squidward:, ,[cuts him off], No, no starfish. Just a regular, normal, peace-loving- ,[the door begins to rumble and the gates open, revealing an entire town of houses just like Squidward's old one. A rainbow is formed. Squidward is overjoyed and walks in. He sees octopus kids at an ice cream truck], Heaven at last. ,[he runs into another octopus walking by],
,Other Octopus:, I've seen more alert people in a retirement home!
,Squidward:, Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar? Don't be late! 
,Other Octopus:, I've heard better comebacks from a turkey sandwich! Get a life! ,[He leaves and Squidward squints angrily at him, then becomes happy],
,Squidward:, This place is even better than I expected! ,[walks down the road, reading off the house numbers], 302, 303, and 304. Beautiful. ,[he walks in to house 304], And not a pineapple in sight. ,[he shuts the door],
,[Cut to night, where Squidward is in cap, nightshirt, and slipper, going to bed. His clarinet, as always, is next to him],
,Squidward:, Good night, Clary. Tomorrow, we begin life anew.
,[the phone rings, startling Squidward. Squidward answers it],
,Squidward:, 304 New Life street, Squidward speaking. ,[he hears SpongeBob on the other end speaking gibberish], There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob! I am finally among my own kind. ,[he hears more garbling], Now, goodbye.
,[He hangs up. Back at SpongeBob's place, he and Patrick are crushed and exchange gibberish],
,[The next day, Squidward walks out of his house and breathes in the fresh air],
,Squidward:, Ahh. I think I'll take my bike today. ,[he takes his bike and rides down the street], I'm my own man. ,[he runs into that octopus from the other day, who is riding in a line of bike riders], Now these neighbors know how to live. ,[cut to later. Squidward parks his bike in front of the ""Full of Health"" store and walks in and down an aisle], Intensive. Hmm… I bet they won't have- ,[he gasps and grabs a can of canned bread], Wow, they have it! ,[we see the can, labeled ""Best Thing Since Sliced""], ""Canned Bread""! This town is great! ,[he walks out of the store with a bag], I would really be impressed if it had--- ,[he gasps and slaps his forehead when he sees an interpretive dance academy across the street], ---an interpretive dance academy?!? ,[he runs in, now with headband and leotard, and begins dancing happily joins in the dancing, while the other octopuses without headbands aren't as joyful], Yeah! It's even better in a group! ,[cut to later, Squidward is walking down the street], This town is perfect. ,[he sees a gazebo with three octopuses playing clarinets], A clarinet trio?! ,[he runs up next to them and begins playing his clarinet. Cut to the next day, Squidward walks out again and breathes the fresh air], Aah, another great day. ,[he rides his bike down the street and runs into the same bike line], Oh look! Everybody's on their bike today. ,[he walks his bike to the ""Full of Health"" store again and picks up another can of canned bread. Cut to him dancing at the academy], It just gets better and better! ,[cut to him with the trio], All together! ,[they all play. Cut to the next day, he walks out of his house, rides his bike, picks up another can, dances, plays, rides his bike, picks up another can, dances, plays, and this continues over and over, but Squidward gets less and less happy with each passing scene. Eventually, he's really depressed, now playing with the trio], I sort of... don't feel like playing my clarinet today. ,[he walks off. Cut to the next day, Squidward sits on a bench in the park, all glum], Yep, this is great. They might as well rename this town ""Squidward's Paradise."" Or perhaps ""too much paradise."" ,[he hears a reef blower, Squidward picks his head up], SpongeBob? ,[he sees an octopus blowing the leaves with it. The octopus then leaves, leaving a sign next to the blower reading, ""Back whenever."" Squidward is tempted, but dismisses it. But it's too much, and he goes over and touches it, setting it off for a second. He giggles. He whistles nonchalantly, and knocks off the sign], Oops. ,[he then picks up the nozzle and switches it to 'Suck.' His nose gets sucked up, and he switches it back to 'Blow,' freeing himself. His lengthened nose floats over it. He chuckles. A female octopus walking by clears her throat. Squidward quickly goes to the lawn], Leaves. Just getting the leaves. ,[she walks off. Squidward takes the blower back to the bench and blows the nozzle on his face, distorting it upward. He blows on his eyelids, distorting them upward. He chuckles. He puts the nozzle under his shirt and blows that up too. He laughs. He points the nozzle to the left and is blown to the other side of the bench. He laughs again. He points the nozzle to the right and is blown off the bench. He laughs all the same. Two octopuses playing croquet nearby start getting annoyed],
,Squidette:, Would you pipe down over there, iron lung? ,[the two start laughing, their foreheads fluctuating up and down as they do. Squidward sucks up the croquet balls and the man's croquet hammer which he was leaning on. He falls to the ground. Squidward laughs],
,Squidward:, Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a ""leg"" to stand on! ,[he continues laughing. The woman helps the octopus up],
,Squidette:, Hey! That's not funny!
,Octopus #1:, Yeah! ,[another man walks by, with a clarinet in his hand],
,Octopus #2:, What's going on over here?
,Squidette:, ,[Points at Squidward], It's that guy! He's playing with a reef blower!
,Octopus #2:, Playing? With a reef blower? That's the most childish thing I've ever heard of!
,Squidward:, But it's fun!
,Octopus #2:, ,[laughs], How could you possibly have fun with one of those oversized hair dryers?
,Squidward:, Like this! ,[Squidward sucks up the man's clarinet, and it gets stuck in the nozzle, playing sour notes. The octopus screams],
,Octopus #2:, Give it back! Please! ,[Squidward blows it back at him, lodging it in the middle of his face like a crease. Squidward laughs maniacally and runs off. He approaches an octopus on a bike and sticks the nozzle to the ""wheel""],
,Squidward:, Tag! You're it! ,[he blows on it, inflating the octopus's head.],
,Octopus on bike:, Wah! ,[Squidward laughs and runs off. Cut to a 'Le Café' stand, where two guys walk up to it], Le Café
,Squidette:, What can I get you boys? ,[Squidward opens a door on the stand and sucks up the two guys' eyes and noses and blows them back out, but puts two noses on one guy and four eyes on the other guy. He runs off laughing],
,Octopus:, What are you looking at?
,Octopus #2:, Those. ,[meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick approach the complex],
,SpongeBob:, Here it is, Patrick. Now we've just got to convince Squidward to come back home. You got our apology cake? ,[Patrick picks up a cake that reads, 'Sorry.' He puts it back in his pants, revealing a giant cake-shaped bulge in them], We're ready!
,Patrick:, Ying! ,[SpongeBob pushes the button on the intercom],
,Guard:, Hello, can I help you?
,Patrick:, Can I get a large #1, extra size?
,SpongeBob:, But you just ate three orders of fried oyster skins! ,[Patrick opens his mouth, the fumes emerging from it. A foghorn sounds],
,Patrick:, I love... fried oyster skins. ,[cut to inside the control room, where the guard sees SpongeBob and Patrick on one of his monitors],
,Guard:, We're sorry, but your kind isn't allowed here. ,[a security guard walks up next to him], He's not leaving, Orville. ,[the fumes enter the room], You got your night stick ready? ,[the two smell], Fried oyster skins?! ,[the two collapse, the guard falling on a button opening the gate],
,Patrick:, I guess we've got to order inside. ,[meanwhile, a group of octopuses are angrily chasing after a happy-go-lucky Squidward. He sucks the noses off of three houses whilst running by. SpongeBob and Patrick are walking by when they see Squidward run past them],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! That looked like Squidward! ,[the mob runs past them], That looked like Squidward also, in angry mob form! ,[Squidward has approached a dead end],
,Policeman:, Hold it right there, Mr. Tentacles!
,Squidward:, Stand back! I've got gardening tools! ,[the policeman hands him an envelope],
,Policeman:, Here! Just read this! ,[Squidward looks at it],
,Squidward:, What is it?
,Policeman:, A well thought out and organized list of complaints! ,[the mob shouts out in agreement. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, look! It's Squidward! ,[he runs up to the guy and hugs him, but he's a different octopus with eyebrows and mustache, and a shirt like Squidward's], Squidward! We finally found you! ,[the octopus pushes SpongeBob off him],
,Octopus:, Get off me! I'm not Squidward! ,[pause],
,Patrick:, Are you Squidward now?
,Squidward:, Grievances! This town is a grievance! There should be a law against so many stuck-up tightwads living in one place! This city needs to be destroyed!… or at least painted a different color.
,Policeman:, FYI, you don't have to live here, you know! ,[Squidward, and the crowd, smile],
,Squidward:, Hey, you're right! ,[the crowd members' smiles fade], And I'm leaving ASAP! ,[meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to find Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Are you Squidward?
,Male Octopus:, No. ,[he walks up to the croquet woman],
,SpongeBob:, Are you Squidward?
,Squidette:, No. ,[Patrick talks to a fire hydrant],
,Patrick:, Are you Squidward? ,[pause], That's okay, take your time. ,[SpongeBob walks up to him],
,SpongeBob:, Any one of these Squidward's can be the real Squidward, Patrick! ,[the town rumbles as Squidward rockets the leaf blower out of Tentacle Acres and laughs maniacally. The octopuses smile],
,Squidward:, Freedom! Woo-hoo! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick watch him fly over the horizon],
,SpongeBob:, Well, we know one thing: it sure isn't that guy!

,[The scene shows SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, No problemo. Nice and... easy!

,SpongeBob:, The reserve tanks are almost empty. ,[Patrick grunts], Patrick!
,[Patrick is shown using the axe to chop at the tanks.],
,Patrick:, Finished.
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, you gotta get out of there! It's a straight shot up the stomach to the esophagus where the reed is! ,[A note plays], You can complete your mission if we can just access an alternative fuel. ,[through the speaker], Like natural gas.
,[Patrick comes into the scene, holding a soda.],
,SpongeBob:, Natural gas?
,[Patrick drinks the soda],
,Patrick:, Like this!
,[Patrick burps.],
,Squidward:, Stop burping inside me! That's disgusting!
,Sandy:, Wait a minute, Squidward. He might be on to something.
,Squidward:, What?
,Sandy:, If you can make a big enough burp...
,Patrick:, We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!
,SpongeBob:, Wow.
,Sandy:, He's right.
,Squidward:, What?
,Sandy:, We're going through with your plan, Patrick!
,SpongeBob:, Yay!
,Patrick:, What plan?
,[Squidward is shown drinking a bottle of soda. He puts it with several other bottles.],
,Sandy:, Now burp, Squidward! Lives are on the line!
,[Squidward tries to burp. Inside, the submarine is still digesting.],
,SpongeBob:, I never thought it would end this way. ,[Squidward burps loudly. A bubble forms below the submarine. It then engulfs the submarine. The reserve gas levels rise to maximum.], It's working!
,[The submarine starts up and pops through the bubble and out of the stomach.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whee!
,Sandy:, They're headed for the esophagus. ,[She sniffs the air.], Phew, what have you been eating?
,Squidward:, Morons.
,[the submarine crashes into Squidward's throat where the reed is.],
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.
,[He swims out wearing a swim suit, floaties, goggles, and flippers.],
,Sandy:, Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow.
,SpongeBob:, I'm already on it.
,[He takes out a hammer and hits the reed with it, repeatedly. A card that reads, ""Two Hours Later"" appears.],
,French Narrator:, Two hours later.
,SpongeBob:, This stupid hammer won't break anything.
,[SpongeBob throws it at the reed. The hammer bounces back and cuts SpongeBob's floaties, making him bounce around. Patrick opens the hatch, wearing goggles.],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, do what you were born to do! Dance!
,SpongeBob:, You're right Patrick. Whirlpool Spin! ,[He cuts the reed in half like a buzzsaw with the spin, causing Squidward to cough it up.],
,Sandy:, ,[Over the speaker], Good work, guys. Mission accomplished. ,[The scene returns to her.], Now all you have to do is...
,[pushes Sandy out of the way],
,Squidward:, Get out of my body! Go!
,Patrick:, Grow?
,[He presses the grow button. The alarm starts up. The scene becomes a split screen. The left has Sandy, the Middle has Squidward, and the right has SpongeBob.],
,Sandy, Squidward, and SpongeBob:, No!
,[The scene goes black. The scene then changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Off-Screen], Almost ready to open. ,[The scene then shows him finishing up polishing a golden ""No refunds"" sign.], There.
,[The sound of a door opening is heard.],
,Squidward:, Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you? ,[The scene zoom out to show Squidward with a submarine-shaped body.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[inside Squidward], Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs.
,[A toilet flushing is heard. Squidward gets angry.],
,Patrick:, ,[inside Squidward], Squidward, the toilet's backed up again.

"[episode starts in a field with the clams flying. Squidward is shown to have two clouds with a rainbow over his head, bordered by many jellyfish],
,Squidward:, My, what a beautiful day it is outside. ,[scene switches to Krusty Krab], Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, Who are you talking to, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Just like I always seem to be on a nice sunny day.
,SpongeBob:, Look at it this way, Squidward: Things could always be worse.
,Squidward:, Worse? How?
,SpongeBob:, Well, uh...
,[fish walks by and sneezes all over a Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, Uh...you could be sick.
,Squidward:, Sick? Is that really any worse?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Being sick is awful! The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough. But that's not even the worst part.
,Squidward:, Oh, really.
,SpongeBob:, No. The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab.
,[the words ""Krusty Krab"" echo in Squidward's head],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward!
,Squidward:, Huh? Oh, SpongeBob. I'm suddenly not feeling very well. ,[inadequately coughs],
,SpongeBob:, What's the matter?
,Squidward:, Well, Uh. Let's see. Uh. I got a scratchy throat and, uh, ,[sticks out tongue], dry mouth, and my, um, uh, my eyes are itchy. ,[scratches left eye vigorously],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, what could it be?
,Squidward:, I'm not sure. But I fear I might be coming down with a dreaded illness.
,SpongeBob:, Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?
,Squidward:, Name? Oh, uh. Per, swees, swer, squeer, uh, squid's disease.
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, Squid's disease.
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, Squid's disease!
,SpongeBob:, ,[he gasps], Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob? SpongeBob. ,[camera pans to find SpongeBob hiding behind three pillows], What are you doing back there?
,SpongeBob:, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for somebody in your condition would be to ,[gulps], go home and not come back until you're fully recovered.
,Squidward:, Well, SpongeBob, ,[stutters], I think you're probably right.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles], I'm so sorry, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr. Krabs. ,[inadequately coughs again],
,Mr. Krabs:, You're sick?!
,Squidward:, ,[inadequately coughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you don't look any sicker than you usually do. ,[Squidward frowns], You know what. I better give you the old navy onceover just to be sure.
,Squidward:, The what?
,[Mr. Krabs lifts Squidward's nose],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now open wide.
,[Squidward opens his mouth],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pulls out tongue], Tongue looks fine. ,[lets it go, opens left eyelid], Eyes, check. ,[knocks on Squidward's forehead],
,Squidward:, Ow!
,Mr. Krabs:, Forehead feels normal. ,[lifts two of Squidward's legs], Now let's see those kneecaps. ,[hits kneecaps, causing Squidward's legs to slowly bend upward and then back downward], Reflexes are a little slow. But I'd expect that from you.
,Squidward:, Wonderful.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle.
,Squidward:, But, Mr. Krabs...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[slams fist on desk], Mr. Krabs nothing.
,Squidward:, But I...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[slams fist on desk again], Mr. Krabs nothing!
,Squidward:, But...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[slams fist on desk again], Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead. I'm gonna keep sayin' it.
,Squidward:, And what about the customers? You don't want them to get sick, do you?
,Mr. Krabs:, No. And I don't want them to get hungry either. ,[pushes Squidward out of office], So step to it, Mr. Squidward. Oh yeah, and get well soon. ,[laughs and shuts door],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs. fish speak among each other in cash register line],
,Squidward:, ,[takes bill from fish], SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, puh-lease?
,SpongeBob:, ,[muffled], Right away, Squidward.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob halts], Turn around, please.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns around and appears to be wearing a gas mask], Yes. ,[heavy breathing],
,Squidward:, And just what is that supposed to be?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, this. It's a number 2: Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink...
,Squidward:, Not that. Not that. The thing on your face.
,SpongeBob:, ,[points to his gas mask], Oh, this.
,Squidward:, Yes.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case should anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have. Then I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias.
,Squidward:, ,[appears in front of SpongeBob, and lets out a breath, stretching his words], Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Could I see that?
,SpongeBob:, Um, actually no.
,Squidward:, Because I find this all so very inte... ,[sneezes into nose of mask], ...resting.
,[SpongeBob takes off mask, screams, and runs into Mr. Krabs' office],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Neptune's Knee-highs, lad! How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[knocks on door while speaking], Mis...ter...Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's better. Now what can I do you for?
,SpongeBob:, It's Squidward. He's sick.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that.
,SpongeBob:, Who was the first?
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marmalade Mountain. ,[lowers his voice and ponders], Doesn't sound like a bad gig actually.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays! ,[panics and falls to the floor],
,Fish:, One Krabby Patty, please.
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, got a minute?
,Squidward:, Oh, of course. It's not like I'm busy working or anything.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[leans in], We've got a situation with the kid. Something's got him spooked.
,[SpongeBob is shown holding his nose and mouth tightly],
,Mr. Krabs:, He can't cook in this condition. No cookin, no patties. No patties, no money.
,Squidward:, And you're telling me this, why?
,Mr. Krabs:, I need you to make yourself scarce for a while.
,Squidward:, So, you're telling me to go home?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!
,Squidward:, Yippee! Thanks, Mr. Krabs! I mean ,[inadequately coughs],
,SpongeBob:, Poor Squidward.
,[in the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is... ,[scratches right eye], My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is... ,[scratches eye once again], That's funny. My eyes feel itchy. ,[pauses, coughs], And my throat feels scratchy, too. ,[laughs, drops spatula worriedly], Itchy eyes, scratchy throat... ,[rubs tongue only for smoke to come off and gasps, hoarsely], Even my mouth feels dry! ,[normal], I've contracted... Squid's Disease! ,[yells],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[barges into kitchen], SpongeBob, everything all right in here?
,SpongeBob:, Everything's fine, captain. Just a little, uh, howl for pleasure.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, how about a little less pleasure and a little more work? ,[shuts the door],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to himself], If Mr. Krabs finds out I have the Squid's Disease, he'll send me home, just like Squidward. Wait a second! That's it! Why go home when I have Grandma's down home folk remedies right here? ,[fills pot with water], Grandma always said: 'If you might be coming down with an illness, just stick your feet in hot water.' ,[places feet into water], Or was it cold water? ,[places feet into ice. Shivers], Something tells me it wasn't that either. Of course! It wasn't hot water or cold water! It was boiling oil! ,[places feet into fryer], Uh-huh. I can definitely feel the medicinal qualities. ,[takes feet out, fried to a crisp], Oh no!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! You sure everything's alright?
,SpongeBob:, ,[places feet and legs back into boiling oil], Yes, everything's fine in here. ,[Mr. Krabs shuts door], Just dandy. ,[takes feet and legs back out], I better conceal these unslightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious. ,[smears liquid onto right leg], This super hot spicy yellow mustard will do the trick. Well no, actually that burns real bad. ,[worriedly], Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some— ,[holds up pickle jar], pickles! Pickles are like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come. ,[pours all the juice and the pickles onto legs, sigh of relief turns into loud screams of pain], Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns! ,[crashes into trash bin and mop. Rolls into more trash bins. Customers listen to racket],
,Frankie Billy:, Do you guys hear what's going on?
,Harold:, Yes, and I'm very puzzled.
,Nat Peterson:, So am I, in fact, I might even be a little concerned.
,Harold:, Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.
,[SpongeBob comes out of kitchen with trash covering him; crawls in front of Frankie Billy, Harold, and Nat Peterson and then lies on side],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something.
,Harold:, Coming down with something?
,Nat:, I refuse to be served by a sick fry cook.
,Harold:, Me too. Let's get outta here!
,Frankie Billy:, Good idea!
,[fish banter while two other fish march out of restaurant],
,Mr. Krabs:,  ,[gasps], Me customers! ,[looks at SpongeBob lying on back now and gasps], You look terrible.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, Mr. Krabs. ,[coughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection. SpongeBob, go home. That's an order!
,SpongeBob:, But who's going to run the restaurant?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles], Who's gonna run it? I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back. I'll show ya.
,[scene cuts to Squidward's house],
,Squidward:, ,[appears to be resting on a chair with the radio on. sighs], Who thought that having an illness could feel so good? ,[drinks beverage],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward. ,[Squidward spits out drinks],
,Squidward:, Oh, no! What happened to you?
,SpongeBob:, I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right, Squidward? ,[coughs. Squidward appears to have disappeared], Squidward?
,[inside Squidward's house],
,Squidward:, Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors. But at least I can relax and enjoy ,[sighs], some afternoon tea.
,SpongeBob:, That sounds like a great idea, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[drops tea and screams], SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?
,SpongeBob:, I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to be funny, but they always make me cry.
,[in the Krusty Krab, the customers are in a riot],
,Mr. Krabs:, 25 Krabby Patties! ,[leaps into kitchen and sprints out with Krabby Patties. Throws food randomly], Order up! Order up! Order up!
,Henry:, Hey, I didn't order a table patty! ,[Krabby Patty appears to be splattered on table],
,Shubie:, Yeah, or a window patty!
,Fish 3:, Or a face patty! I want a refund!
,[fish start riot yelling refund. In Squidward's house],
,Television:, Female: I love you Ted. Male: Ditto. ,[both engage in laughing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[seen crying and blows into tissue], Wasn't that great, Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, yeah, howdy. That's too bad it had to end. Finally.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, don't worry. We have all 99 sequels to watch next.
,Squidward:, Oh, would you look at that. I'm suddenly feeling much, much better. I think I'm going back to work now, bye. ,[rushes out house back to work being followed by SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! Squidward, wait! Squidward! You're not well enough to return to work! I can't let you!
,Squidward:, Please just stop! Stop following me!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
,SpongeBob and Squidward:, ,[both gasp], Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[appears to be lying on ground with mustard and buns covering him], I told you. I could run this place all by myself. Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease.
,SpongeBob:, Squid's Disease? I know just the cure! ,[holds up romantic comedy disk],
,Mr. Krabs:, Romantic Comedy?! No! ,[crawls away], Ahh! Get that thing away from me!

"[The episode begins at nighttime. Squidward, who appears to be very tired, is ready to go to bed.],
,Squidward:, Oh, why can't I get to sleep? Let's try it again. ,[sighs], Warm milk. ,[drinks milk], White noise machine.
,[Squidward turns on the noise machine and it blows bubbles out. He groans as he closes his eyes. His eyelids say ""10 Grit"" on them. Then he wakes up.],
,Squidward:, Dim lights. ,[turns off lights and groans], ♪Sleep, little Squidward, catch some winks everything and everybody clearly stinks♪
,[Squidward shuts his eyes, curls up in his bed, and tries to go to sleep. Suddenly, a loud belch is heard and a startled Squidward clings on the ceiling with his suction cups.

,Squidward:, You know, normally, I jump up and scream when you appear like that. But I'm so tired, I'm just gonna take your stupid advice.

,Patrick:, SpongeBob? What's happening?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know.
,[Squidward closes his eyes and goes to sleep. As he sleeps, he starts to fall. SpongeBob forms into a mattress and catches Squidward before he hits the floor. Squidward pats on SpongeBob's eyes as if they are his pillows and lays down to sleep.],

,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick creating a monstrous version of Squidward in a laboratory. They take him out of the tank and set him down. SpongeBob gives the monster a clarinet. But instead of playing music, it goes wild and crashes through a wall. It then proceeds to rampage across Bikini Bottom, destroying several buildings.],
,Patrick:, Eureka!
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick. It didn't work.
,Patrick:, Ooh, we've tried everything under the ocean and we failed! If only we could just crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet.
,SpongeBob:, That's it! We could crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet!
,Patrick:, ,[Forgetting what he said.],Oh, whose dumb idea was that?
,SpongeBob:, Yours.

,SpongeBob:, How's that feel, buddy?
,Patrick:, Not bad. Okay, get on my shoulders.

,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Excuse me. Sorry.
,[Patrick gets up and falls backwards, bumping into Orchid. Orchid explodes after she falls. A boat bumps into Patrick, sending two passengers flying.

,SpongeBob:, Pardon me.
,Officer Rob:, Hey, Twinkle Toes, you're in a no dancing zone. Now beat it.

,SpongeBob:, Uh, let's ask someone.
,[SpongeBob flies Squidward around like a plane and lands in front of Miss Shell.],

,[Miss Snell removes her glasses. SpongeBob struggles to stay still in Squidward's mouth.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[grunting], Whoa!

,Maestro Mackerel:, And don't come back!
,Musician:, Oh, man. That conductor's brutal.
,[The rejected musician walks away with a trumpet tangled to his head. Patrick enters the concert hall, but trips over one of the steps. As they fall, Squidward, who is still asleep, spits SpongeBob and Patrick out.],

,SpongeBob:, ,[as Squidward], I was just, oh, um, ,[picks up music stand], the thing is not on the thing. ,[throws music stand], Oh, uh...
,Maestro Mackerel:, Who is that imbecile?
,Octavius Rex:, Squidward Tentacles. Apparently he's a clarinet player. ,[gets hit with a toaster],
,Maestro Mackerel:, All right, whenever you're ready.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispering], The clarinet, where's his clarinet?
,Patrick:, Oh, I got it.
,[Patrick turns and reveals that Squidward's clarinet is in his butt.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Disgusted],Ew, why'd you put it there?
,Patrick:, I guess I never actually thought of the moment where we'd have to play it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[digs around Squidward's brain], Let's see, the ability to play clarinet has got to be in his brain somewhere. It's just a matter of squeezing it out.
,[SpongeBob makes Squidward put his clarinet on his eye. However, Patrick takes the clarinet and plays horrible notes with it. SpongeBob continues to mess with Squidward's brain. Maestro Mackerel begins to become irritated and bends a trumpet.],
,Maestro Mackerel:, ,[growls], All right, thank you, next!
,[Patrick takes the clarinet and surprisingly plays beautiful music.],
,Both:, Huh?
,[Patrick continues to play beautiful music and dances around the stage. SpongeBob conducts the music with Squidward's brain.],
,Maestro Mackerel:, He's magnificent.
,[Suddenly, unknown to SpongeBob and Patrick, Squidward finally wakes up and notices that he's playing the clarinet.],
,Squidward:, What—what's going on here? Where am I? I'm at the audition. I'm playing, but I'm not in control. I—I feel like I've been taken over by something.
,Patrick:, What's going on?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know what's happening! I'm losing control!
,Squidward:, ,[struggling to regain control], Must... gain... control!
,Maestro Mackerel:, That's an unusual playing style, but still. He sounds magnificent.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I don't think I can command his brain much longer!
,Patrick:, Me neither, SpongeBob!
,[Squidward turns his eyes and sees SpongeBob and Patrick inside him.],
,Squidward:, What was that—SpongeBob? Patrick? You're inside me?! Oh, how did this happen? Get out of my mind!
,[Squidward punches SpongeBob with his eyes.],
,Squidward:, Get out of my body! Just—just—just get out!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick fight Squidward inside his body. SpongeBob pulls Squidward's nose and bites his brain. Patrick punches Squidward inside. Squidward inhales and vomits SpongeBob and Patrick out of his body.],
,Both:, Ta-da!
,Squidward:, Oh, I am going to lambaste you two!
,Maestro Mackerel:, You're a wizard. A magical, musical wizard.
,Squidward:, I—huh? Oh.
,[Squidward prepares to play his clarinet.],
,Maestro Mackerel:, Yes, yes! Oh, bring us the ecstasy, maestro!
,Squidward:, I envy you common people. For you are about to have the glorious honor of hearing me play Gustav Mollusk's Symphony No. 5 in C Sharp Minor. For I am in complete control.
,[Squidward proceeds to play the clarinet. However, instead of playing beautiful music as he did before, he squeals out loud and horrible notes. Maestro Mackerel and Octavius Rex cover their ears. The lights break. SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes crack and break like glass. A flock of birds fly away. Chunks of ice fall in the water. Two large buildings collapse to the ground.],
,French Narrator:, Later...
,[The bus drives SpongeBob, Squidward and Patrick home from the concert hall. SpongeBob and Patrick sleep while Squidward is feeling rejected as he got his clarinet wrapped around his head. Squidward hears beautiful music from outside of the bus. He looks out the window and sees the monster squid playing music with a building like a clarinet. The monster roars and the crowd cheers for its performance.],

,Stanley:, Yep.
,Patrick:, Interesting. Let's see how good you are at nothing.
,SpongeBob:, That's perfect! Patrick can do nothing better than anyone! ,[whispers in Stanley's ear], You'll be learning from the master!

,Sandy:, I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, okay? Tell some of them other jokes you got.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Nervously], Other jokes? ,[Imagines the fork joke], Bah! I got a million of them.
,Sandy:, ,[Hugs SpongeBob], Thanks, SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand. ,[Walks to her seat. The crowd is still chanting for SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants. ,[Everyone cheers as SpongeBob walks out],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, hi. ,[Chuckles nervously], Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish. ,[Crowd is confused], I guess you heard that one.
,Sandy:, I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water! I mean, the stuff's everywhere.
,Patrick:, Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh... ,[takes out a big rubber chicken], Hey, what about this thing! Huh? Huh?
,Fish #5:, Get on with the squirrel jokes! ,[Crowd chants for squirrel jokes],
,SpongeBob:, ,[thinking], What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make: ,[Looks at Sandy], your friends ,[Looks at his microphone], or your career.
,[After a beat, he drops the microphone and everyone gasps. He walks backstage then, after a beat, jumps back on stage with hillbilly teeth],
,SpongeBob:, Howdy, y'all! ,[Crowd cheers loudly], How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?
,All:, Because they're so darn stupid!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Laughs as he walks around tooting a bicycle horn], My people! ,[Sandy gets angry], But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy. ,[Spotlight on Sandy as the two women around her giggle], Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes. ,[to audience], Am I right? ,[Crowd cheers; to Sandy], Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you?
,Sandy:, ,[deadpan], I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport. ,[to audience], Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... ,She's a squirrel!, ,[Crowd is cheering their loudest], Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night! ,[Walks backstage], Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob. ,[Sees a note taped to his mirror], Oh, what's this, a fan letter? ,[Reads it],
,Sandy:, ,[voiceover], You were right, SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy.
,SpongeBob:, You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends. ,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to the Treedome with his water helmet on and flowers in his hands. He knocks on the door as the water empties from the Treedome], I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy. ,[Door opens], Good morning, Sandy.
,[He stares on; Sandy is dressed as a hillbilly with flies floating around her],
,Sandy:, Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, are you feeling alright?
,Sandy:, I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self! ,[Licks her teeth with her tongue. SpongeBob laughs nervously], Well, come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off! ,[Pushes him onto a log with glue on it],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.
,Sandy:, Naw, ,[Holds up a brush and a bucket of glue], I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off. ,[Gasps and grabs the flowers that SpongeBob was holding], Are them flowers for me? You even done got me a vase! ,[Takes SpongeBob's water helmet off his head],
,SpongeBob:, But, Sandy, that, that's not a... ,[Sandy places the flowers in the water helmet],
,Sandy:, Ain't that purdy?
,SpongeBob:, ,[already dried out], Sandy, I need wa...
,Sandy:, Oh, that's right. Youse a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see, uhh... ,[A big lump in her throat wiggles up and down], Sea critters need, uhh...
,SpongeBob:, Wa...
,Sandy:, ,[covers SpongeBob’s mouth], Oh, wait, don't tell me. I know this one!
,SpongeBob:, Wa...
,Sandy:, Wa...llet? Watch? Waffles?
,SpongeBob:, ,[hoarsely], Sandy! Water!
,Sandy:, Well, why didn't you just say so! ,[Puts the end of a hose in SpongeBob's mouth], Here you go! Yup, us squirrels sure is stupid. ,[Connects the other end of the hose to a pipe then turns it on. SpongeBob enlarges as more water enters into him],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy!
,Sandy:, Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! Okay, Sandy, I get it!
,Sandy:, What's that? You want more? ,[Connects to the end of the hose to a bigger pipe and turns it on], Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter! ,[SpongeBob is still enlarging],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Sandy, okay! I get it! ,[SpongeBob is filled up every inch of the Treedome], No more squirrel jokes. ,[Scene cuts to the Komedy Krab where the crowd is chanting for SpongeBob again. SpongeBob, who has bandages on his face, goes on stage], Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel. ,[winks at Sandy. cut to Patrick show his happily exciting smile, Sandy blinks with a smirk], And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.' ,[Crowd laughs], But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge! ,[Crowd is silent], I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae! ,[Twists himself], Look at me! I got no bones!
,Fish #6:, That's true. ,[Crowd laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Laughs], It's true, I am cheap!
,SpongeBob:, Now, let me tell you about those fish? Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really! ,[Imitates a fish], Soap... soap... what is... soap? ,[Crowd laughs more. SpongeBob and Sandy give each other a thumbs-up as the scene cuts to an outside view of the Krusty Krab], And don't even get me started on starfish!

"[The episode begins on a beautiful, summer day at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy are playing a basketball.],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble—,[both pause and stare at the ball],
,Sandy:, Hm?
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[goes back to bouncing the ball], Dribble, dribble, ,[Patrick bounces the ball with his head], dribble, dribble, ,[then Patrick bounces the ball with his butt], dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble.
,[Sandy groans impatiently and looks at her watch.],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble.
,[Patrick bounces the ball with his tongue.],
,SpongeBob:, Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble.
,[Sandy grows more impatient and scratches her helmet.],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[Patrick bounces the ball with his stomach], Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble—
,Sandy:, It's been ten minutes! Ain't you gonna shoot?!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[long pause then resumes bouncing the ball], Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, ,[Sandy runs over to a boat, chews some barnacles off and makes a ball of her own], dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble—
,[Sandy runs over SpongeBob and Patrick and shoots the barnacle basketball in the net.],
,Sandy:, Sorry, but you boys were slower than a Sunday afternoon. ,[throws the barnacle basketball at Patrick; the scene changes to Sandy having SpongeBob and Patrick compete in a little hot dog contest], On your mark, get set, eat!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick pick up their hot dogs, give each other a toast of friendship, and slowly begin chewing on them.],
,Sandy:, Wow, you two are off like a herd of turtles. Watch this! ,[eats a hot dog],
,[Sandy hops over to a hot dog stand, kicks it, holds her breath, catches the hot dogs with her helmet, puts helmet back on, and eats all of the hot dogs.],
,Sandy:, ,[burps], I win. ,[pulls her flower off her helmet],
,[Sandy's bad breath exits her helmet and forms into a big hot dog. The hot dog-shaped fumes of Sandy's breath float past SpongeBob and Patrick. They smell it and their heads shrink.],
,Sandy:, Hot dang! I'm faster than green grass through a goose! Hm, these jumbo dogs are much too big for your baby heads. ,[grabs the hot dogs and smooshes them into small hot dogs], These dinky dogs should do ya. ,[stuffs the dinky dogs in SpongeBob and Patrick's mouths],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[muffled], Thank you.
,Sandy:, You're welcome! ,[blows airhorn],
,[The scene changes to Sandy warming up for volley ball. She makes a good serve with the ball and hits Larry, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs really hard.],
,Sandy:, ,[bounces on the net], I win again! ,[hops over to Larry, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs], That's right! ,[grabs them and squeezes them real tight], I own all of y'all! Yee-haw!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, don't you think you're playing a teensy-weensy bit rough? Just a smidge? Hm?
,Sandy:, Aww, I'm actually going a little easy on you guys, seein' as you're all so delicate. ,[lets them go and takes out a bucket of chum], Hey, who wants to play ""dodge the chum?"" ,[throws some chum at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, No, I don't think I'm—,[gets chum thrown in his face], Sandy is really stressing me out today. You want to go jellyfishing?
,Patrick:, ,[licks the chum off SpongeBob's face], No, I'd rather go jellyfishing.
,SpongeBob:, You sure you don't wanna go ,[takes out his jellyfishing net], jellyfishing?
,Patrick:, I said no. ,[takes out his net], I wanna go jellyfishing.
,SpongeBob:, ,[groans], Okay, we'll do what you want.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick skip and laugh as theiy head to Jellyfish Fields. Sandy stands on a pile of beaten up pedestrians including Pearl, Squidward, Larry, and Mr. Krabs.],
,Sandy:, The name is Sandy Cheeks and I can lick any critter on any beach!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick happily chasing jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields.],
,Patrick:, Now this is fun!
,SpongeBob:, ,[mocks RP accent], Yes, quite the civilized sport, eh, what?
,Patrick:, ,[giggles, morphs into a horse and mocks RP accent], I say, No more rough-horsing. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[morphs into Sandy and talks in Southern accent], And no more you-know-who killing the casual vibe.
,[Suddenly, Sandy pops out from the grass and startles SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,Sandy:, Hey, guys! ,[both SpongeBob and Patrick gibber in fear and Sandy takes out her net], Mind if I join you?
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[weakly], Not at all.
,Sandy:, Great! I can't wait to kick some jelly booty! ,[snatches SpongeBob and Patrick in her net],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, the thing is, Sandy, in jellyfishing, we don't play to kick booty. We actually catch and release the little sea angels.
,Sandy:, Well, that sounds about as exciting as tap water soup. Oh, well. Your game, your rules. ,[lets them go],
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick holding up their nets for the jellyfish to fly in. One jellyfish flies in SpongeBob's net and he laughs. Then it flies into Patrick's net.],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], He's in mine now!
,[The jellyfish flies back in SpongeBob's net.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Now he's in mine!
,[The jellyfish flies back in Patrick's net and Patrick laughs. The jellyfish flies over to a bench where two other jellyfish are sitting on. It gives one jellyfish a high-five and lets it have a turn. The jellyfish flies into SpongeBob's net. Sandy is not too thrilled with this at all.],
,Sandy:, ,[flatly], Whoopee. ,[growls as she walks over and catches the jellyfish with her net], Whoo-hoo! ,[holds up a hunting plaque], You're gonna look good mounted on my wall!
,SpongeBob:, Uh-uh. Catch and release, Sandy.
,[Sandy reluctantly lets the jellyfish go and it flies into SpongeBob's net. SpongeBob laughs and skips around with the jellyfish in his net.],
,Sandy:, Well, this is lamer than a paper sandwich.
,[The scene changes to three jellyfish circling over tall grass. Sandy is hiding under the grass, spying on them.],
,Sandy:, Hey! ,[catches one jellyfish], Ooh! This one's fat as a tick! ,[catches the other two with her net], Ha, ha! Got you!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick wander around in the grass and see no jellyfish at all.],
,Patrick:, Huh. The jelly-thingies were here a minute ago.
,SpongeBob:, It isn't let them to be so...coy.
,[Sandy pops up from the grass and laughs. The jellyfish in her suit stings her from the inside.],
,Sandy:, ,[laughs], I guess they must've—,[gets stung again], Gotten sick of the boring game! ,[gets stung again; she sees another jellyfish and follows it], Get in here, you slimy varmint!
,[Patrick catches the jellyfish before Sandy could.],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, look! How's it going, little guy?
,Sandy:, ,[growls], So that's how you wanna play it.
,[Four jellyfish fly over Sandy and she lowers herself into the grass.],
,Sandy:, ,[pops out from the grass and opens her suit], Hi-ya! ,[catches the jellyfish with her suit], I'm catching and releasing—releasing from their freedom!
,SpongeBob:, ,[comes out from the grass and sees a jellyfish], Hey, widdle jewwy bewwy. Would you mind?
,Sandy:, ,[pops out from SpongeBob's body], Mine! ,[catches the jellyfish with her net, laughs, and blows her airhorn in SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, What? ,[sees one of his holes all flappy], Ugh.
,Sandy:, ,[jumps back into her suit], Yeah! ,[chuckles], Easier than slipping down a mudslide! ,[gets zapped by the jellyfish in her suit], Okay, okay! I know. Catch and release. ,[unzips her suit, releases the jellyfish, and zips it back], Isn't there anything more to this game?
,SpongeBob:, What more can anyone want?
,Patrick:, Yeah, it's perfect!
,Sandy:, I have an idea how we can ,[squeezes SpongeBob and Patrick really tight], kick things up a notch!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Sandy, I really don't think we need to kick anything up any notches.
,Sandy:, ,[lets them go and holds up a can of Frankenstein fish food], Ha! Frankenstein Fish Food! Ooh, this should be fun! ,[holds up a gun and shoots the can of Frankenstein fish food in the air],
,[The can explodes and releases green food in the shape of Frankenstein's head. The jellyfish fly over and eat the food. Suddenly, the food causes the jellyfish to buff up and become stronger. Then then extend razor-sharp blades.],
,Sandy:, Ha, ha! That's what I'm talking about! They're no longer jellyfish. Now they're jelly-buzz saws!
,[The jelly-buzz saws fly down and begin attacking SpongeBob and Patrick. One of them flies into SpongeBob's net and flies away with SpongeBob. One slides Patrick's net in half with its blades.],
,Patrick:, Hey! You're supposed to fly into there!
,[The jelly-buzz saws slice Patrick's head open and they fly into his head. They pops out his eyeballs and begin stinging him on the inside. Patrick now glows in a light-blue transparent.],
,Patrick:, ,[screams in agony], I'm a walking glow stick! ,[screams as the jelly-buzz saws chase after him],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, Nelly, little jelly! ,[trips over a rock and flips around and around before crashing into a cactus], Ow. ,[now covered in prickles], Such a soothing pastime.
,[Sandy, now in a superhero suit, flies over SpongeBob with her rocket boots. One jellyfish is pulling Patrick by the trousers. Patrick is screaming in fear before Sandy scares them off of him. She takes out a box and activates a little cage.],
,Patrick:, Thank you, Super Sandy! ,[the cage expands and sends Patrick flying],
,Sandy:, Welcome to the jellyfish rodeo! ,[pushes button on her glove and catches a jelly-buzz saw with her net], Aha! ,[spins it around], Gotcha, varmint!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream in horror as they watch Sandy torturing the jellyfish in front of them. Sandy tosses the jelly-buzz saw in her cage.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that is not how we do it! ,[gets stung and beaten up by the jelly-buzz saw], Carry on.
,Sandy:, Hands off that jellyfish, SpongeBob! He's mine! Oh, you are so mine!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets strangled and beaten up by the jelly-buzz saw], No...problem. ,[the jelly-buzz saw lets go of him], Oy.
,[The jelly-buzz saw flies away and Sandy zooms past SpongeBob and Patrick. Sandy catches up to the jelly-buzz saw and catches it with a catcher's mitt.],
,Sandy:, You're out! ,[takes the jelly-buzz saw and throws it into her cage], Hit the showers! Hm? ,[jellyfish fly over her], Time for spring cleaning! ,[activates the vacuum on her suit and sucks up most of the jellyfish; she then drops them into the cage from her suit], Into the dustbin of history!
,[Just then, numerous of angry jellyfish loom over Sandy. She lays two black marks on her helmet and gives out a warcry. She then starts flying around and catch jellyfish with her net, without showing signs of any mercy. SpongeBob and Patrick watch in fear and get zapped by the incoming jellyfish. Sandy zooms past them and carelessly begins destroying Jellyfish Fields with her rocket boots. She continues to catch almost all of the jellyfish in the fit of insanity and completely sets all of Jellyfish Fields on fire. She stuffs all of the jellyfish in her cage.],
,Sandy:, Whammer, bammer, in the slammer! Whoo-hoo! I'm the queen of Jellyfish Fields! How does that feel, losers? ,[crazily blows her airhorn],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely charred from Sandy's reckless competing.],
,Patrick:, ,[hoarsely], I don't like it. ,[his head is lit on fire and his face disintegrates a bit],
,SpongeBob:, I can't see or hear you, for my face has been cauterized. ,[his arms disintegrates],
,Sandy:, Ah, you guys are just out of shape. Come on, ,[knocks over Patrick], best two out of three.
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens his right eye], But you've got all the jellyfish.
,Patrick:, And there's no more field.
,Sandy:, ,[gasps], Oh? ,[turns around and sees the destructive mess she made all over Jellyfish Fields; she giggles sheepishly], Did I do that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[his body crumbles], Yes.
,Patrick:, ,[turns and sees his buttocks burned], You did this, too.
,Sandy:, I guess I can be overly competitive at times.
,Larry:, ,[comes by on crutches and in bandages], Gee, you think?! Ow! Ow! Gah! ,[leaves],
,Sandy:, You guys'll be all right. ,[picks SpongeBob up and turns him and Patrick around], if you just walk it off.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick pick up their nets and begin to walk home, feeling devastated that their peaceful day of jellyfishing has been ruined.],
,SpongeBob:, Don't forget to release 'em.
,Sandy:, Oh? Hm? ,[gasps when she sees her cage open and the jellyfish gone], Yeah! That problem is solved. Now to my other problem. ,[begins flying away home, starting to feel remorseful about ruining SpongeBob and Patrick's day with her competitive side], Ah, I've got some deep-dish thinking to do about my aggressive ways.
,[But just as Sandy leaves the destroyed Jellyfish Fields, the angry jellyfish she captured in her cage form into one giant angry jellyfish monster. The scene changes to Sandy's treedome, where Sandy did some redecorating and begins meditating in order to calm her aggressiveness. Her treedome has a flowing river, a stone pagoda, two bridges, some new trees, a windchime, a birdhouse, and a gong.],
,Sandy:, ,[meditating], Om. Om. Om. ,[grabs a rake with her foot and forms a yin-yang sign in the soil; then she grabs the gong and rings it], Om. ,[plays a panflute, makes a rainbow, and rings the gong], Om. Turns out, I'm the best at relaxing, too. ,[blows her airhorn],
,Airhorn:, Om.
,[Meanwhile, outside Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob and Patrick are running and screaming their heads off. They run over to the front door of Sandy's treedome and frantically knock on it.],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Oh, Sandy, help! It's horrible! ,[screaming and yelling while knocking on the door],
,[They turn around and see the giant angry jellyfish monster flying over to them. SpongeBob and Patrick scream.],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Oh, Sandy, help! It's—,[enter through the front door, closes it, and scream], Oh.
,[Both SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe as they see Sandy's treedome redecorated. The giant jellyfish monster roars and bangs outside the treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick cower in fear.],
,Sandy:, Ah, brother SpongeBob. Brother Patrick. I bow to your good natures. What can I do for you?
,SpongeBob:, You can clobber that giant jellyfish monster thing!
,[The giant jellyfish monster bangs hard on the treedome, making a crack.],
,Patrick:, Yeah, smash it up good!
,Sandy:, Oh, I couldn't do that. I'm non-violent now. ,[gently pets a butterfly on her finger], I wouldn't hurt a fly-fish.
,[The giant jellyfish monster lifts the treedome up and fills it with water. SpongeBob saves Sandy's life by putting his helmet onto her. The giant jellyfish monster enters the treedome begins zapping SpongeBob and Patrick with its stingers. Then it looms over to Sandy and prepares to attack her.],
,Sandy:, How about some soothing music, jellyfish? ,[begins playing a flute, but gets zapped by the giant jellyfish monster; she grabs some sand and forms it into a sitar], A soothing sitar always brings me peace.
,[Sandy begins playing music on her sand sitar. The giant jellyfish monster starts to calm down and it seems to be working at first. But it wasn't powerful enough to soothe the savage beast. The giant jellyfish monster crushes Sandy with its fist, stretches her up, zaps her and plays rock music on her like a rock star. Then it throws her next to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are hiding behind her tree. SpongeBob picks Sandy up and straightens her out.],
,Sandy:, ,[groans and pulls herself together], The gongs! They always calm me down.
,[The giant jellyfish monster continues zapping everything all over the place. SpongeBob and Patrick run over to the gongs and ring them really hard.],
,Sandy:, ,[meditating], Om.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[joins in meditating], Om.
,[The giant jellyfish monster holds its ears shut in anger, buffs up and roars. It grabs the gongs and slams them into SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy. Sandy's attempts to calm the giant jellyfish monster are now in vain. The savage beast destroys nearly everything in her treedome and crushes SpongeBob and Patrick with its fists. Sandy, realizing that SpongeBob and Patrick are literally in danger, gets really mad.],
,Sandy:, ,[growls], Okay, that does it. I was a pacifist, but now I'm gonna pass my fist through your face! ,[floats up above her tree], As destroyer and transformer, I transform to destroy you. ,[begins to glow in a bright light while meditating],
,[The giant jellyfish monster takes out six machetes and growls.],
,Sandy:, Put up your dukes and fight me like a squirrel!
,[The giant jellyfish monster throws the machetes down to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick frantically dodge the incoming machetes to avoid getting hurt. Sandy and the giant jellyfish monster throw punches and kicks at each other. But the beast was much more stronger and powerful than Sandy can imagine. The monster punches Sandy and sends her flying into the glass of her treedome.],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, catch! ,[throws a bag up to Sandy],
,Sandy:, ,[catches the bag], The universe gave us a terrible weapon made up of the darkest dark matter just for this occasion. ,[takes out a bucket of chum], Ever played ""dodge the chum?""
,[The chum bubbles. The giant jellyfish gasps, grabs both SpongeBob and Patrick and zaps them.],
,Sandy:, Hey, get your slimy mitts off my pals! ,[starts throwing chum at the giant jellyfish monster], Hiya! Ya!
,[The giant jellyfish monster retaliates by using SpongeBob and Patrick as shields. SpongeBob and Patrick get splattered by chum. Patrick eats the chum from his face. The giant jellyfish monster roars and blows a raspberry at Sandy.],
,Sandy:, ,[dodges the giant jellyfish monster's electricity], Whoa! ,[growls], Hiya! ,[throws more blobs of chum at the giant jellyfish monster, but it sucks up the chum], Nothing! That's it! ,[flies into the giant jellyfish monster's body],
,[The giant jellyfish monster, thinking that it didn't hurt. But, much its surprise, Sandy begins attacking it from the inside and starts glowing while getting bigger.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh…
,Patrick:, Pretty.
,[The giant jellyfish monster explodes and reduces itself into many harmless, little jellyfish. The jellyfish lower SpongeBob and Patrick down, gently. Patrick releases some jellyfish from his pants. Sandy floats herself down in a calm and gentle feeling.],
,SpongeBob:, Who are my good little jellies? You are.
,Patrick:, ,[pulls out a wallet and gives a jellyfish a dollar], Here you go. Buy yourself something nice.
,[SpongeBob giggles happily now that the jellyfish are calmed down.],
,Sandy:, Well, let's get these little jellies back to their home.
,[The scene changes to a newly restored Jellyfish Fields.],
,Sandy:, ,[laughs as she gently strokes a jellyfish], They really are sweet. ,[gets zapped and growls angrily], I'm gonna destroy you! ,[growls as she chases after the jellyfish],
,SpongeBob:, That's our Sandy.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Hm? Which one's Sandy? ,[laughs],

"Squidward:, Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. ,[looking at his watch while SpongeBob is mopping the floor], I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again! ,[Real-life footage of a cheering crowd appears behind Squidward],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward. ,[crowd disappears],
,Squidward:, Okay. ,[walks out of the Krusty Krab],
,Squilliam:, ,[talking to a group of people], So, I just took my private yacht across my private lake to my private heliport. It's the only way off my private island.
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], Oh, shrimp! It's my arch rival from high school, Squilliam Fancyson! I can't let him see me in my Krusty Krab uniform. ,[takes off his hat and is about to put it in the trashcan],
,Squilliam:, On your lunch break, eh, Squiddy?
,Squidward:, Yes... I mean no... I mean... uhh, uhh... Hey, whatcha been up to?
,Squilliam:, Oh, just succeeding in everything you've failed in.
,Squidward:, You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson. Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom.
,Squilliam:, Oh, is that so? Let's hear what you've accomplished since high school, Squiddy.
,Squidward:, ,[thinking to himself], Don't be intimidated, Squidward. Try to imagine him in his underwear. ,[imagines Squilliam as a hot underwear model], Oh, no, he's hot! ,[to Squilliam], I'm, uhh, in... food service.
,Squilliam:, Hold it, don't tell me. You're a cashier! ,[laughs. His group laughs with him],
,Squidward:, ,[thinking to himself], Don't lie. Lying always makes it worse. ,[to Squilliam], I own a five-star restaurant!
,Squilliam:, ,[as the crowd gasps], Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success.
,Squidward:, That's right.
,Squilliam:, And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight. ,[Sound of glass breaking. Squidward's nose shrivels up in extreme shock],
,Squidward:, T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?
,Squilliam:, In fact, we'll all come. My treat! ,[group cheers. Scene cuts to Squidward in Mr. Krabs' office],
,Squidward:, Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, boo-hoo! Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin. ,[rubs his fingers and music plays],
,Squidward:, This is serious.
,Mr. Krabs:, I know. This really ,is, the world's smallest violin. ,[tiny violin is shown], See?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.
,Mr. Krabs:,  Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam? ,[Squilliam's unibrow appears above Mr. Krabs' head], That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?
,Squidward:, Don't rub it in.
,Mr. Krabs:, Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.
,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs standing straight in a line. Squidward is walking back and forth in a white tuxedo.],
,Squidward:, Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible. ,[Patrick appears next to SpongeBob with an army hat on his head], Patrick, what are you doing here?
,Patrick:, I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!
,Squidward:, The Corps? What the... Pat, this isn't the... oh! ,[sighs], Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?
,Patrick:, You mean like a weenie? Okay! ,[talks like a weenie], May I take your hat, sir? May I take your hat, sir? May I...
,Squidward:, ,[shuts Patrick up], Alright, I've heard enough. You've got the job. ,[walks off], Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye-aye!
,Squidward:, Then you'll be our chef. ,[Mr. Krabs walks off],
,SpongeBob:, What can I do?
,Squidward:, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.
,SpongeBob:, What's that?
,Squidward:, It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.
,SpongeBob:, Do other restaurants do that?
,Squidward:, Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this. ,[hands SpongeBob a book],
,SpongeBob:, ""How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes."" Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!
,Squidward:, Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!
,Patrick:, Gimme that hat! ,[shaking a coat rack with a hat on it], I said give it to me! Are you gonna hand it over or not? Don't you back-sass me! ,[jumps on the coat rack and starts punching it],
,Squidward:, He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential! ,[an explosion in the kitchen is heard. A bunch of green goop flies out], What happened? What is it?
,Mr. Krabs:, Peas! ,[a can of peas, still in the can, is on the stove and is on fire], Made 'em the old-fashioned way.
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the... ,[gasps], Holy fish paste, what is that?! ,[notices a giant goop pile of food on the grill, with flies and other things sticking out of it],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's the appetizer.
,Squidward:, But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?
,Mr. Krabs:, Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea. ,[Squidward walks out of the kitchen],
,Squidward:, There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me! ,[walks over to SpongeBob], Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob? ,[turns SpongeBob around. SpongeBob looks like a zombie, tired from reading all the pages],
,SpongeBob:, I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!
,Squidward:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Every sentence, every paragraph... ,[slams the book on his face between each word], Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?! ,[brain starts to swell], My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode! ,[he explodes],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax. ,[SpongeBob lowers his arms], Little more. ,[SpongeBob lowers his arms more], Little more. ,[SpongeBob's face falls to the floor], Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.
,SpongeBob:, Empty my mind?
,Squidward:, Empty your mind.
,SpongeBob:, Empty my mind...
,Squidward:, Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing. ,[inside SpongeBob's head, we see a bunch of smaller SpongeBobs working on computers in an office],
,Smaller SpongeBob #1:, ,[Runs into the office], Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!
,Other Smaller SpongeBobs:, Everything?
,SpongeBob #1:, Everything! ,[everyone starts to panic and start throwing everything away], Come on, come on, come on! Bring 'em, bring 'em, bring 'em! Jellies, jellies! ,[Another smaller SpongeBob shreds papers marked ""Jellyfishing"" then ""Childhood memories"" then ""Spice Garden Tips], Let's go, let's go! Keep doing it! ,[walking towards another smaller SpongeBob], Come on, let's get moving! ,[talking to a smaller SpongeBob], Hurry up! What do you think I'm paying you for?
,Smaller SpongeBob #2:, You don't pay me. We don't even exist. We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought.
,Smaller SpongeBob #1:, One more crack like that and you're out of here!
,Smaller SpongeBob #2:, No, please! I have three kids! ,[more dumping persists. Scene cuts back to SpongeBob, with a blank look on his face],
,Squidward:, How do you feel? ,[cuts to SpongeBob, still with a blank face], SpongeBob? ,[snaps his tentacles as SpongeBob drools], This isn't working! I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time! ,[runs out the door], I'll just go to Squilliam's house and... ,[stops because he sees Squilliam and the group], Squilliam, you're here!
,Squilliam:, Hello, Squiddy! ,[Squidward steps back], We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.
,Squidward:, Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!
,Squilliam:, Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school, ,[walks in], are trying to pass off a lousy burger stand as a five-star... ,[gulps], ...restaurant!? ,[inside of the restaurant looks very professional with nice wallpaper, an orchestra, a chandelier, and other things], Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina... ,[Squidward joins in chanting ""Hommina"" and then the group comes in and starts to chant ""Hommina"" as well. SpongeBob comes in with a tuxedo on],
,SpongeBob:, Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately! ,[picks up the group of customers with one hand],
,Squidward:, ,[whispering], How did you do all this?
,SpongeBob:, It was easy, once I cleared my mind.
,Squidward:, But what about Krabs and Patrick?
,SpongeBob:, Taken care of. ,[Mr. Krabs and Patrick are tied up and gagged in the back], Right this way, please. ,[seats everyone quickly. Then Squilliam is seated without a chair at first, but SpongeBob then rushes back to give his a chair to sit on], Good evening, sir. ,[gives Squilliam a menu], From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg? ,[gives Squilliam a shoulder massage as he takes away his menu. As he explains what Squilliam is eating, he gives him a napkin to put on his neck and feeds him the dinner], We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank. ,[While telling him all of this, he makes Squilliam's experience the best he can so he treats him like royalty doing all sorts of things],
,Squilliam:, Mmm... this is fantastic!
,SpongeBob:, ,[salutes with all the hands that helped], Thank you, sir.
,Squidward:, Pinch me, I must be dreaming. ,[SpongeBob pinches him with a pin], Ow!
,SpongeBob:, If you need anything else, just call.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!
,SpongeBob:, Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do. ,[takes a deep breath and runs off],
,Squidward:, It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face. ,[SpongeBob is combing Squilliam's unibrow], Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.
,Squilliam:, ,[his eyes tear up], Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!
,Squidward:, In that case, I need you to read this. ,[hands Squilliam a card],
,Squilliam:, Uhh, ""Squidward Tentacles...""
,Squidward:, ,[puts a foam finger with words ""#1 Squid"" on his left hand], And I need you to wear this.
,Squilliam:, Oh, eh, ""Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest...""
,Squidward:, ,[puts a microphone in front of Squilliam], I'm sorry, one more time. ,[Squilliam's voice is over the loudspeaker],
,Squilliam:, ""Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs."" ,[everyone cheers], Squidward, I must tell you... ,[SpongeBob pours more water in Squilliam's glass and he drinks it], Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name. ,[record scratches],
,SpongeBob:, My name?
,Squilliam:, Yes, your name, son.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh... Beef Wellington?
,Squilliam:, ,[chuckles], No, your name.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh... err... the fork on the left?
,Squidward:, Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.
,SpongeBob:, My name? ,[zoom inside of SpongeBob's brain again where all the SpongeBob's are searching for a name],
,Smaller SpongeBob #3:, ,[as he checks file cabinets], What's his name?! What's his name?! I've got nothing on a name!
,Smaller SpongeBob #4:, ,[pressing a key on a keyboard connected to a computer], Come on, baby, what's the name?!? ,[The computer bursts into flames. Panicked shouting is heard from other smaller SpongeBobs as they are running around while papers are flying],
,Smaller SpongeBob #5:, We threw out his name! ,[More smaller SpongeBobs begin to run around while more papers are flying. SpongeBob's brain then breaks in half. Cuts back to Squilliam and Squidward with SpongeBob stammering for a moment. Then he splashes water on Squilliam and then starts to bark.],
,Squidward:, I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that... ,[he screams as he notices SpongeBob with a bowl of hot soup by Fred],
,SpongeBob:, More soup for your armpit? ,[holds up Fred's arm and throws the soup on his armpits],
,Fred:, ,[screams in pain],
,SpongeBob:, ,[he runs over to Martha and grabs her head], Please enjoy the food! ,[slams her face into her food then runs up to Nat], Would you like some cheese on that, sir? ,[pulls out a cheese grater, picks him up and grates his butt with it as Nat screams. Everyone screams and panics],
,Squidward:, No! Nooo! ,[Patrick, still tied up, runs out of the kitchen, screaming. Mr. Krabs, still tied up, runs out also.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Run for your lives, everyone! It's the appetizer! ,[the appetizer, which has now come to life, bursts through the door and roars. Mr. Krabs is sent flying. Everyone screams and panics. They crash through the windows and the door, running away. Squidward's tuxedo rips in half by itself and falls off, and his Krusty Krab hat and name tag land on him in their proper places. The name tag reads ""Squidward Tentacles, Cashier""],
,Squilliam:, Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.
,Squidward:, ,[his eyes tear up], Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!
,Squilliam:, Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too! ,[He starts to cry and Mr. Krabs plays the violin],
,Squidward:, Is that true?
,Squilliam:, Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my balloon/casino! ,[everyone cheers and follows Squilliam. The wallpaper in the Krusty Krab rips off. Squidward sits down and sighs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks by with a bag of ice on his head], Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?
,Squidward:, Oh, the usual. ,[Mr. Krabs slides over and plays the violin], Would you get out of here!? ,[fade to black, ending the episode],

,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob!

,Patrick:, I sure am, old buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, here comes fun now! ,[Notices a fish driving down the street],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[takes a deep breath], AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ,[Continues screaming, and then starts flopping on the ground, while still screaming. Then they both laugh],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! Doesn't get any better than that!
,Patrick:, Yeah! I love boat screaming! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Here comes another one!
,[Notices another boat with Pilar and Shelly driving down the street],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, AHHHHHHHHH! ,[The boat passes by them],
,SpongeBob:, Here comes another one! ,[Notices Nat driving down the street],
,Patrick:, AHHHHHHHHHH! ,[He and SpongeBob scream as Harold drives on by as well. Then they notice Frank driving a really small car],

,Plankton:, Morons!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,[Notices Nazz], Heeeee... ,[Their heads explode], AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ,[Notices Larry the Lobster driving down the street and they continue screaming as Patrick smashes SpongeBob around. They notice a bus and they both scream through megaphones, until Squidward appears],
,Squidward:, ,[From his window], Would you two mind stopping with your baby games!? Didn't anybody tell you it's the break of dawn!?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, good morning, Squidward! Yeah, Patrick here told me.
,Squidward:, When are you two gonna grow up?
,Patrick:, How do you play that?
,SpongeBob:, Oh!? Maybe Squidward can come down and teach us how to play it! That will be real fun, won't it, Patrick? ,[Notices Patrick has fallen asleep. He scratches himself with his leg while he is sleeping. Then SpongeBob notices another boat], AHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhh... ,[Falls down], It’s just not the same without Patrick playing along, too. ,[Taps Patrick who still is sleeping], Alright, Patrick, you leave me no choice. ,[Pinches Patrick and he wakes up],
,Patrick:, Ow! ,[Turns around with something fuzzy on his face], What's the big idea!?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! You have a beard!
,Patrick:, I do? ,[Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick walking],
,SpongeBob:, You sure look grown-up with that new beard!
,Patrick:, Wow! You really think so? ,[Squidward appears behind him],
,Squidward:, And everybody knows that grown-ups never play with kids! And on that note, I would like to personally commend the sea star for taking his first baby steps into the adult world! Facial hair is a good start I suppose.
,Patrick:, I am curious to know what mature people, like Squidward, do. Won't you show me?
,Squidward:, Show you?
,Patrick:, Show me! Show me! Oh, please, please, please! Pretty please! Pretty please!
,Squidward:, ,[Sighs], I know I'm going to regret this... Alright! I will take on this mission!
,Patrick:, Hooray!
,Squidward:, In the hopes that a quiet, grown-up neighborhood will prevail at last. Moving me one step closer to peace and blissy tranquility. A place where I can-
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
,Squidward:, What?!
,SpongeBob:, May I tag along and observe your instruction?
,Squidward:, Why in a million years will I let you tag along?
,SpongeBob:, Because some of your instructions in maturity will rub off on me! Bringing us TWO steps closer to a quiet, grown-up neighborhood!
,Squidward:, Wow, that actually makes sense. It must be working already!
,SpongeBob:, Is that a yes?
,Squidward:, ,[Mumbles], Okay.
,[Cuts to Squidward's house],
,Squidward:, Let me escort you to my place my good sir! We need to start with personal grooming for your grown-up makeover!
,Patrick:, ,[Stretches pants], Sounds good to me!
,Squidward:, We may have to find you clothes as well.
,Patrick:, New clothes?
,Squidward:, To go along with your new beard which makes you look very distinguished!
,Patrick:, Distinguished?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Holds up hand], Alright! Distinguished!
,Patrick:, ,[Also holds up hand], Yeah!

,Patrick:, Oh! Are those chocolate chip cookies? Can I have-
,Squidward:, Patrick! I'm sure you'd rather have some tetrazzini we grown-ups ordered, right?
,Patrick:, Duh, yeah, Squidward. I'm frankly shocked they serve such elementary fare here.
,Squidward:, Indeed...
,[Cuts to the Art Museum],
,Squidward:, And my personal favorite piece is ,[Shows them a statue of a fish on a man's body], this lovely statue from the Reef-aissance Era-

I'm okay! ,[Notices paint on his hand then on his back then looks at the ruined painting. Backs up to the painting and touches it with his back], There! Good as ne- ah! ,[Tries to wipe it off, but only makes it worse. He then lifts up the wall and hides the painting under there.

,Squidward:, You only gone up three stairs! ,[Camera zooms out showing they only walked a few steps],
,Patrick:, It feels like four.
,Squidward:, We are about to enter the pinnacle of grown-up culture here in Bikini Bottom! Also known as: The Famed Bikini Bottom Opera House! ,[The Opera House is show and Squidward has his arms out looking at Patrick],
,Patrick:, What?
,Squidward:, Nothing, let's find our seats. ,[Inside the Opera House on the higher stands],
,Patrick:, Hey, alright! Box seats! Uh, I mean: This seat choice is most mature! Certainly more so than that rapscallion Sponge whose name we shall not mention would've picked!

,Patrick:, A most exemplary performance!

,SpongeBob:, Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack. ,[a kid chains his bike to the wringer. SpongeBob starts crying],
,Patrick:, Hey! Don't you go crying on me! ,[uses a hair dryer to dry SpongeBob's teary eyes], Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.

,SpongeBob:, You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!
,Patrick:, Dig in!
,SpongeBob:, ,[he tries to eat ice cream, but can't because his hands are stuck in the wringer, so he uses his tongue but he can't swallow it], I can't even eat ice cream now! This dumb wringer's in the way!

,Patrick:, Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?! ,[they walk away revealing a sign that says ""Carnival Always Here"". Then they get into one of the seats in the ride], Ready?
,SpongeBob:, ,[struggles to reach the handle, but it's too late, the ride already starts and SpongeBob is flung out of the ride],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[flying through the air], Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!
,[cut to later in the day at the carnival],
,Patrick:, Hey, pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this, too! ,[shows off his ribbon pin], Check it out!
,SpongeBob:, That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.
,Patrick:, Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.
,SpongeBob:, ,[his patience has run out], I said I don't want any! ,[turns and knocks it onto the ground],
,Patrick:, You ruined my cotton candy!
,SpongeBob:, Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!
,Ball Toss Vendor:, Check it out! Public fight!
,Other Vendor:, Working at the carnival sure has its perks! ,[crowd gathers around SpongeBob and Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, I have never felt so ashamed.
,Patrick:, What do you mean?
,SpongeBob:, If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!
,Patrick:, I was only trying to help.
,SpongeBob:, ,[shouts], Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today! ,[This is the exact same thing Mr. Krabs said earlier],
,Patrick:, Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore! ,[As Patrick runs off in tears, the crowd looks angry at SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one.
,Sandals:, Ya know, kid, your body isn't the problem. It's your heart. ,[inside SpongeBob's body, his heart starts to groan sadly], You deserve what you've gotten. C'mon, we're out of here. ,[the angry crowd leaves, listening to what the humanized fish says], Some people are just born mean. ,[SpongeBob frowns in shame],
,[cut to Patrick's Rock],
,Patrick:, ,[his rock opens to reveal him brushing his teeth], Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him. ,[brushes his armpit, then his belly button, then puts the toothbrush back in his mouth], I can do whatever I want! ,[then eats the toothbrush and screams; he gets off his rock], I don't need him. ,[looks at SpongeBob's house and almost calls for SpongeBob to come out, but stops himself], Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge-- ,[stops and covers his mouth], I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest! ,[stares off into space, then blinks and a tumbleweed rolls by], Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.
,Patrick in a Thought Bubble:, Maybe if SpongeBob was here, he could give you pointers.
,Patrick:, Who asked you?! ,[claps the thought bubble away], Forget it! I'll just play...uh... fetch! ,[throws stick, which lands on SpongeBob's doorstep], Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha! ,[pauses, puts his ear to SpongeBob's door], Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help. ,[walks away, but then runs back], Buddy! ,[throws door off hinges], Uhh! SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob has stubble and is sitting in the darkened living room], SpongeBob? Hey, whatcha watchin'?
,SpongeBob:, ,[in chair watching TV, in a trance], My favorite show. ,[shows static on the TV. Then the TV dies], Ha, ha, I love that part!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!
,SpongeBob:, What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.
,Patrick:, Oh, man, he's too far gone.
,SpongeBob:, Not fit to live in society...
,Patrick:, ,[crying], This is all my fault! ,[holds up his Forever Glue], Me and my dumb ideas! I'm so sorry! ,[A tear falls from his eye and runs down SpongeBob's arm, and lands on the dried glue on the wringer. The tear melts the glue and SpongeBob is able to pull his arm out],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing! ,[Both start crying, and all of the glue melts off. He then pulls himself out of the wringer], Look! It worked!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, All right! ,[SpongeBob throws the wringer up in the air],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to the viewers], I guess crying does solve your problems after all. ,[to Patrick], Come here, buddy! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick hug. The wringer falls down, trapping SpongeBob and Patrick in it],
,Patrick:, Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?

"SpongeBob:, ,[Stands in Jellyfish Fields. A blue jellyfish floats by SpongeBob. SpongeBob comes from behind a bush and stares at the jellyfish through a telescope. Cuts to his view with the telescope], Wow, four stingers. ,[Puts away the telescope and puts on his glasses. Cuts to the jellyfish, where SpongeBob floats over it with his net. Cuts to the jellyfish alone, where SpongeBob's foot stretches out from off-screen and then the rest of his body appears. He attempts to grab the jellyfish in his net, but he catches himself in the net, then the jellyfish flies away. In the background, a young girl's voice is heard struggling. SpongeBob looks down a cliff and sees the land creature trying to fight a giant clam attempting. SpongeBob gasps], Where have I seen this before? ,[takes out his ,Field Guide, book and skims through the pages], Here it is. ,[cut to picture of a squirrel], Land squirrel. ,[He closes the book], That little squirrel is in trouble. ,[cuts to the squirrel, who is pushing the clam into the ground],
,Sandy:, Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners! ,[she walks away], You're about as ugly as homemade soup.
,SpongeBob:, Hooray, land squirrel! ,[cuts back to the land squirrel, who is oblivious to the clam resurfacing and jumping right at her. Cuts to SpongeBob, who is shocked, his glasses shoot up], Look out! ,[scene cuts to the clam with Sandy trying to escape the clam], Hold on, little squirrel! ,[He does a karate yell in front of the clam, then does the same while bouncing to different sides. He jumps high in the air, and lands on top of the clam; he poses on top of the giant clam], You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai! ,[tries to pry open the clam; he stops], Hey, I'm actually doing it. ,[SpongeBob continues, Sandy finishes prying the clam open from inside it and SpongeBob goes flying into a sea plant], Your shell is mine!
,[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and starts to charge at the clam. He jumps into the clam's mouth and starts to strangle its tongue. SpongeBob sees that Sandy has already escaped and the clam swallows him now.],
,Sandy:, Hold on there, little square dude! ,[She then gets SpongeBob out and kicks the clam around some more and finally kicks it across the sea. The clam whimpers. Sandy leans down to see if SpongeBob is okay.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, you like karate too. ,[SpongeBob does some karate poses, then he stops and falls flat on his head], So, uhh, what's your name?
,Sandy:, Sandy. ,[makes athletic moves], So what do y'all call yourself?
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up a big rock], I'm SpongeBob! ,[jumps down, SpongeBob soon lands on one of his corners],
,Sandy:, Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this. ,[she walks next to a huge rock and slaps it with her hand, making a gong sound effect which precedes the rock breaking into pieces],
,SpongeBob:, Oh. ,[Sandy grins and blinks], Oh yeah? Watch this ,[He prepares to do a karate move, but all he does is make an armpit fart noise. Sandy walks on-screen giggling],
,Sandy:, I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah!,[Karate chops SpongeBob’s head.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! ,[Karate chops her helmet, but realizes it hurts.], Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?
,Sandy:, Why, that's my air helmet.
,SpongeBob:, May I try it on?
,Sandy:, Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air.
,SpongeBob:, Me too. I love air. Air is good.
,Sandy:, No kidding?
,SpongeBob:, Why, ""air"" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air.
,Sandy:, Shee-oot. How about comin’ over tomorrow for tea and cookies then? ,[shows a map leading to Sandy's house], Don't be late.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, see you tomorrow. ,[runs to Patrick's house. Patrick is sun tanning on his rock], Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
,Patrick:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air.
,Patrick:, Do you mean she puts on ""airs""?
,SpongeBob:, I guess so.
,Patrick:, That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are.
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds his pinky up], How's that?
,Patrick:, Higher.
,SpongeBob:, Like that?
,Patrick:, Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants. ,[cuts to Sandy's treedome], Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching. ,[Opens the door as SpongeBob walks in with his pinky raised high and flowers in his right hand.],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, pal. ,[rings the doorbell with a bouquet in his hand],
,Sandy:, Hello?
,SpongeBob:, Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob.
,Sandy:, Hold on a sec, I'll let you in.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whistles then all the water goes down the drain. SpongeBob bangs on the door], Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy! ,[Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob jiggles on the ground], Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in... ,[looks around], ...here.
,Sandy:, ‘Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air.
,SpongeBob:, ,[waves his hand around and smells the air], No water?
,Sandy:, That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!
,SpongeBob:, Problem? ,[laughing], Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! ,[takes a deep breath as Sandy walks off. As soon as she leaves, he lets it all out, and gets black circles around his eyes], With no water.
,Sandy:, ,[cartwheeling], Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah! ,[SpongeBob is walking an inch forward and it makes weak squeaking sounds with every step], That's not in. In. ,[SpongeBob walks another inch and there is more squeaking. Sandy runs, gets SpongeBob, takes his hand, and runs off], You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour. ,[fades to the blazing sun and pan down where Sandy and SpongeBob are standing], So this is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest... ,[SpongeBob gasps], ...purest... ,[SpongeBob gasps again], ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath. ,[Cuts to the birdbath, where a red robin is splashing and chirping], And that's my oak tree. ,[SpongeBob seems enticed by the water in the birdbath. He tries to sneak away, but stays until Sandy lets her guard down], It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees? ,[SpongeBob nods], Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I... ,[SpongeBob finally escapes and wallows in the birdbath, absorbing all the water. He then jumps back to his original spot, and the bird is quite angry. SpongeBob gets back before Sandy notices], ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let’s have that tea now. ,[Does in-air karate moves and moves off-screen. SpongeBob gasps. He hears some knocking from outside. It's Patrick, pointing at his pinky],
,Patrick:, Pinky. Pinky.
,SpongeBob:, ,[blinks, weakly holds up his pinky, and gasps again. Fade to him sitting at a picnic bench. He now has little wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth is all puckered up. He holds up his bouquet], I brought you some flowers.
,Sandy:, ,[walks over], For me? How sweet. ,[Sandy grabs the flowers, but SpongeBob refuses to let go. She finally pries them loose and part of SpongeBob's pinky falls off. He closes his hand], You okay?
,SpongeBob:, ,[the black circles around his eyes are gone. His voice is now hoarse], Yes, I'm okay.
,Sandy:, You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit.
,SpongeBob:, I can’t imagine why.
,Sandy:, Can I get you anything?
,SpongeBob:, Water would be nice.
,Sandy:, I'm gonna to put these in a vase.
,SpongeBob:, Take your time. ,[Sandy goes in her tree and closes the door off-screen. SpongeBob hears it, he then gasps and stumbles toward the door and struggles to open it], I gotta get out of here! Aaaaahh! ,[he then thinks],
,Sandy:, ,[in SpongeBob's head], I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree.
,[SpongeBob struggles even more],
,Patrick:, ,[in SpongeBob's head], When in doubt, pinky out.
,SpongeBob:, ,[lifts his pinky up. He then gets confidence and victorious music plays.], I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... ,[he then sits down, loses confidence again and the music stops],
,Sandy:, Why, these flowers are just beautiful! ,[sniffs], They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice cold water. ,[puts the vase down. SpongeBob is totally enticed by the water. Sandy sits down across from him], So tell me about yourself. ,[Sandy puts her hands under head feeling fascinated about SpongeBob sharing himself], It must be fascinatin’ bein’ a sea critter. ,[SpongeBob watches a drop of water drop down the side of the glass], SpongeBob? ,[a timer goes off], Oh, there's the cookies. ,[walks back into the tree], Be right back.
,SpongeBob:, ,[thinking], I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it. ,[close-up of SpongeBob's face. He's really shriveled now], I don't need it. ,[close-up of vase, then another one of SpongeBob's face], I don't need it. ,[close-up of vase], I don't need it. ,[close-up of SpongeBob's face], I don't need it. ,[long pause, finally yelling ], I need it! ,[He shoots up into the air, bounces off the ceiling and holds the vase.],
,Patrick:, No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up his pinky and starts guzzling down the whole vase of water], I'm a quitter! ,[screams and runs around],
,Patrick:, ,[enters into the dome and slams the door shut], You can't leave now. You'll blow it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hanging on the door], Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good.
,Patrick:, ,[grabs SpongeBob off the door], You're just being shy. ,[carries SpongeBob to the picnic table], Don't worry, buddy. You're doin’ fine. ,[starts getting weak], I won't let you blow... this. ,[drops SpongeBob and crawls on the floor, panting. He coughs and sputters, then stands up], WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?! ,[runs toward the door and tries to open it], There's no water in here!
,SpongeBob:, ,[joins in on the door-opening struggle], I tried to tell you!
,Patrick:, We've gotta get out of here!
,SpongeBob:, You're... doing it... wrong...
,Patrick:, Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. ,[The two pass out.],
,[fades to the sun],
,Sandy:, ,[walks out of the tree with tea and cookies], Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...
,[She screams and drops her tray. On the grass is a live-action sponge and starfish. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill those helmets with water],
,Sandy:, There, that oughta do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked. ,[Sandy carries over a tray with three tea glasses. Everyone takes one], I propose a toast, to new friends. ,[She drinks it. SpongeBob and Patrick lift their drinks up and they clink the glasses on the helmets, causing them to spill], Hold on a second. ,[She places a tea bag in each helmet, allowing the two to drink the tea water], I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up. ,[Patrick nudges SpongeBob and they both put their pinkies up. They sip the tea.],
,All:, Ahhh.

"Psychic:, As consort to the spirit world, I now commence this séance. Ploobus, plorum, spaghetti, granolum. I now summon the unliving! ,[ground shakes, thunders are heard, the crystal ball shines; ghost comes out of the crystal ball],
,Ghost:, Why have you disturbed me?
,Psychic:, Because, you keep forgetting to replace the toilet paper roll! ,[shows empty toilet paper roll], As roommates, we all have to do our part.
,Ghost:, I know, but it wasn't me this time. 'Twas Gale who left things... unreplenished.
,Psychic:, Gale?
,Gale:, Sorry.
,Psychic:, ,[screams],
,Squidward:, ,[laughs while watching TV], How cheesy. Who would ever be frightened by that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[breathing very loudly and quickly; his sweat gets on Squidward's head],
,Squidward:, ,[wipes the sweat off], Hey! MoistBob DripPants, you mind?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward. I just never seen a séance before.
,Squidward:, Well, try to contain yourself. We have a customer.
,Old Man Jenkins:, I'll have me a Rusty on Rye please.
,Squidward:, Charming colloquialism, but let's try something that's actually on the menu.
,Old Man Jenkins:, Stop giving me the round around city boy! I want a Rusty on Rye and nothing less!
,SpongeBob:, Just leave it to me, old rusty one! Prepare for a... What the barnacles is a Rusty on Rye? ,[pulls out file cabinet from his brain], Let's see... R... R... R... Ramblin Ham, Red Herring, Rib Tickler, Rusty Penguin, Salty Steamer. Huh, guess I don't know how to make Rusty on Rye. ,[puts file cabinet back in his brain], But I can certainly learn! Help me out, sir. Can you clue me in on what was on your beloved Rusty on Rye?
,Old Man Jenkins:, Huh? Oh, let's see, um, I think it was on rye bread, it was #9 on the menu, it came with a side of something or other...
,Fish 1:, Oh come on! Are you gonna order a patty or what, pops?
,Fish 2:, Let's get it moving here! ,[fish argue],
,Mr. Krabs:, What's the big kurfuffle? Oh, it's you. Only what's on the menu, old-timer!
,Old Man Jenkins:, This ain't no kinda way to treat a loyal customer! ,[leaves],
,Squidward:, Hah hah hah. Well, that's a first for you. An unsatisfied customer.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], No! ,[runs to Mr. Krabs' office], Mr. Krabs! There was an unsatisfied customer! Why don't we serve the Rusty on Rye anymore?
,Mr. Krabs:, Because we never did. That sandwich was on the menu of an old restaurant that lay here a long time ago! Twas' an old ramshackle shack called Rusty's Rib Eye, and the only one who ever knew how to make that sandwich was the owner, Rusty Rickets. However, old Rusty bought the farm 20 years ago.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Nope. You're not getting that recipe unless you're versed into talking with the unliving.
,SpongeBob:, I believe I've seen a program on this matter!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[spins around in chair], Err... Scram. This conversation's making me dizzy.
,SpongeBob:, I may be able to get that recipe after all. I just need to call in a favor. ,[calls Patrick], Hi Patrick! SpongeBob here. ,[beat], Yeah, the one with square pants. Mm-hmm. Hey, listen, can you meet me after work? I need your help with something. ,[beat], Your best friend SpongeBob SquarePants.

,Mr. Krabs:, Good night, kiddo.
,SpongeBob:, Good night, bossman. Patrick and I will lock up.
,Mr. Krabs:, Fine. But no eating me inventory.
,Patrick:, Okay.
,Mr. Krabs:, Or me furniture.
,Patrick:, What? Come on, bossman! If we can't eat anything, why are we here?
,SpongeBob:, Ahh, simple, my five-pointed friend. Tonight, we shall make contact with the unliving! ,[thunder roars], By performing... a séance! ,[thunder roars],
,Patrick:, Then can we eat some furniture?
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Patrick:, ,[screams] [thunder roars],
,[Scene changes to Patrick laying on a table; SpongeBob puts a ,Krabby Patty, with a candle on it on Patrick's head. SpongeBob blows a bubble and it lands on Patrick's stomach],
,SpongeBob:, As consort to the spirit world, I know commence this séance! I shall invoke the specter of Rusty Rickets by reading from ,The Sacred Text., ,""Distilled vinegar, water, number one mustard seed, salt, tumeric, paprika, natural flavors."", I now summon the spirit of Rusty Rickets! ,[silence], Know, too, that I beckon the spirit of Rusty's Rib-Eye!
,[Thunder is heard, the bubble rises, turns green and shows a spirit of Rusty's Rib Eye],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Rusty's Rib Eye!
,Patrick:, But where's Rusty?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick look through the window. Ghosts of sandwiches appear and join together and make the spirit of Rusty Rickets],
,Rusty Rickets:, ,[mumbles],
,SpongeBob:, Rusty Rickets!
,Patrick:, A big ghost?! I thought we were- we were conjuring a rib roast! I'm outta here! ,[runs away, but runs into the wall. Patrick then runs out the door], I'll get help buddy! Just get me away from this freak!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs nervously], Uh, he means freak in the nicest possible way. Alright, enough of this hocus pocus hooey. Time to put in some work! ,[slings away his hair net and puts on his Krusty Krab hat], Say, uh, Rusty, how about spilling the beans for the old Rusty on Rye recipe?
,Rusty:, ,[mumbles],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh, well that was... just gibberish. Hmm... I got it! How bout you write down the recipe for the classic #9? 
,Rusty:, ,[mumbles] [pencil and paper goes through Rusty's hand],
,SpongeBob:, Oh right. You're a ghost. Hmm... how about you just show me how to make one?
,Rusty:, ,[mumbles] [signals, SpongeBob follows Rusty inside his shack as Rusty floats through the door],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Gee, Rusty. What a setup you got here. But where's all the sandwich bread, the condiments, the cold cuts?
,Rusty:, ,[mumbles] [Rusty takes out a driftwood and carves it into a sandwich],
,SpongeBob:, A rye sandwich carved entirely out of driftwood? Mama mia!
,Rusty:, ,[humming and spreading spackle on it and dips it in shellac],
,SpongeBob:, Spackle, shellac.
,Rusty:, ,[mumbles],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you want me to try it?
,Rusty:, ,[mumbles],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, okay. ,[sniffs], Hmm... smells industrial! ,[bites] ,Ugh! Um... I'm sure it's an acquired taste., ,[the smell comes out of the restaurant; a ghost pops from under the floor and smells],
,Ghost 1:, ,[sniffs], Is that... ,[sniffs], Mmm! It ,is ,a Rusty on Rye! Gentlemen! Get up here! The ""classic #9"" is back! ,[ghost laugh, as more ghosts follow him into the shack],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! I didn't summon you guys!
,Ghost 2:, No, but the scent of an order of a #9 did.
,Ghost 1:, Even from way down there. ,[points down],
,SpongeBob:, Uh oh! It looks like were running low on shellac! I'll go get some more. ,[screams], Boy, those guys can sure terrify.
,Ghost 1:, You know, this little suarae could never of happened without ol' Rusty here. Let's all give a ghastly howl for Rusty Rickets! ,[ghosts howl],
,SpongeBob:, Alright guys, I hate to be a party pooper, but it's a little late for all this noise.
,Ghost 3:, Oohh... big face doesn't want us as patrons anymore! How about we make like a tree... and leaf! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! That is private property! Maybe you guys should leave!
,Ghost 1:, Oh yeah? ,[ghost vomits],
,SpongeBob:, Do I have to call-- ,[gets vomited on], Eww... ectoplasm.
,Ghost 1:, Enough fooling around! How bout we have a good ol' time like we used to!? ,[ghosts chant as SpongeBob gasps. Ghosts destroy the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, You better have a darn good reason for getting me outta bed! ,[ghosts continue partying inside],
,Patrick:, That good enough for ya? ,[SpongeBob screams],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! Patrick! Help!
,Patrick:, Sorry SpongeBob, but this is the part of the story where I run away again only this time I don't know where to run to, so I'm just gonna go circling around the building ,[screams and starts runnin],
,Mr. Krabs:, Looks like a certain foolish sponge has been conversin' with the unliving! All right you floating nuisances! Time for the bossman to mop up! ,[ghosts laughs], Batter up! H'ya! ,[whacks ghosts into bubble as a ghost roars], Yeah, and go back in which ye came! ,[pops bubble],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Mr. Krabs--
,Mr. Krabs:, Never hold a séance boy-o... without me permission, because ghosts are like relatives. Once you let them in, they never leave! ,[scene changes],

,[His boat is knocked again by Plankton's tank. His boat continuously spins, spinning upwards like a helicopter propeller, and crashes onto a Bikini Bottom News blimp. The blimp pops.],
,Plankton:, Outta my way, you fool! ,[knocks Mr. Krabs' boat],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa! ,[His boat goes out of control and goes up an icy cliff. He shivers and is covered in ice. Falls down onto Plankton's tank, breaking apart the ice.],

,[Mr. Krabs and Plankton stop in midair and sit in their respective desks.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, sorry cutie.
,Plankton:, Suck up.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ohh, it's on!
,Plankton:, Ohh, bring it!
,Mrs. Puff:, Ohh, I said knock it off! ,[puts on brass knuckles], Now don't make me get rough!
,Plankton:, Brass knuckles, huh? Respect.
,Mrs. Puff:, Now, just settle down and watch this movie on driving safety. ,[turns off the light and turns on the movie projector],
,Movie Narrator:, Oh, yes. The freedom of the open road. The feeling of the wind in your hair and the sun on your shoulder. Yes, there's nothing like driving. But when you don't follow the rules, driving can become deadly. ,[SpongeBob appears driving backwards and runs on top of a driver's boat], From crusing down the highway to parallel parking. ,[SpongeBob crashes several passing boats, then crashes into a mailbox],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, sorry! ,[crashes into two boats], Sorry! Oh, sorry! ,[his boat falls into pieces],
,Movie Narrator:, You don't want to be a SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Oh! That's me! ,[laughs as the airbag activates in his face],
,Movie Narrator:, So remember to follow these simple rules. Number one, always check your mirrors.
,[A car with four convicts drive in a boat. One convict checks his mirror and sees the cops chasing them.],
,Convict:, Uh-oh!
,[SpongeBob bashes away the police car.],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah!
,[SpongeBob shields his eyes and bashes away the boat with the convicts inside.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, cool camera. Can I see? ,[crashes into a coral tree, flies out of the movie screen, and crashes into Mrs. Puff],
,Mrs. Puff:, Ahh! ,[puffs up], Ooh! Ohh.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pulls himself out of Mrs. Puff's belly], Ehh. Ah. Whoa. Sorry I'm late.
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, I told you before, use the door!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Mrs. Puff. I was so excited for class, I must've forgot ,[chuckles],
,Mrs. Puff:, Just clean this place up. I need to call my therapist. ,[pants as she rolls herself out the door],
,SpongeBob:, ,[picks up the movie projector], Ooh, this is so great having you in class with me, Mr. Krabs. 'Cause now, you're not only my boss, you're also my classmate and, dare I say it, my best friend. ,[laughs as he hugs Mr. Krabs], Aww, ,[grabs Plankton and hugs him too], make that two best friends.
,Plankton:, Get off!
,SpongeBob:, Ohh, I think someone is nervous about being the new kid in class. Well, no worry, I'll show you all the ropes. ,[pulls up the screen], Did you know that every time you do something good, Mrs. Puff gives you a star sticker? ,[shows them the good noodle board],
,Plankton:, Stickers? I'm an adult. I don't care about stickers.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, me neither. No matter how cool and shiny they are. ,[becomes mesmerized by the star stickers and giggles], I'm gonna have so many stars, Puff will have to get a bigger board! ,[laughs evilly],
,Plankton:, Forget it, Eugene, I am going to be the star pupil!
,[Mrs. Puff comes back, talking on her phone.],
,Mrs. Puff:, The prescription is for the mega dose, right?
,Therapist:, Yes, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, thank you, doctor.
,Therapist:, Yeah, bye-bye.
,[Mrs. Puff hangs up her phone and takes out her book.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Now, if everyone will turn to page 20 in their driving manuals.
,[Plankton pushes an apple on Mrs. Puff's desk.],
,Mrs. Puff:, What's this?
,Plankton:, Oh, nothing. I just thought you could use a little snack. Winkety blink.
,Mrs. Puff:, Why, thank you. You get a star. ,[puts a star under Plankton's name on the good noodle board],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gives her a grapefruit], Oh, is someone hungry? Ta-da!
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, a grapefruit. And a star for you. ,[puts a star under Mr. Krabs' name on the good noodle board],
,Plankton:, How about some melon? ,[throws a watermelon at Mrs. Puff],
,Mrs. Puff:, Uh! ,[wipes off the watermelon], Alright, boys, enough with the fruit— ,[gets stuffed in the face with fruit by Mr. Krabs and Plankton],
,Mr. Krabs:, I want those stickers!
,Plankton:, Forget it, Krabs! They're mine! Ah!
,[Mr. Krabs and Plankton continue throwing fruit at Mrs. Puff.],
,Plankton:, Ahh, I'm through wasting time here. ,[pulls out a bag of apple tree seeds], Straight from the source. ,[hops on Mrs. Puff's mouth and plants the seeds until it grows into an apple tree],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[muffled], Enough!
,Mr. Krabs:, Aw, but I want more shiny stars!
,Plankton:, No, I do!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[chops the apple tree with her teeth], You want stars? ,[lifts up the tree], I'll give you stars! ,[whacks Mr. Krabs and Plankton with the apple tree],
,Plankton:, ,[feels dizzy and chuckles], Beautiful stars.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I want some. ,[whacks himself with a tree trunk], Doink! Ehh, ehh.
,Mrs. Puff:, Give me those! ,[grabs SpongeBob's stars],
,SpongeBob:, Ohh.
,[The scene changes to Mrs. Puff giving a demonstration outside with her students.],
,Mrs. Puff:, When driving, it's important to be aware of everything around you. That's why we have mirrors. And that's why it's important to constantly check our mirrors. Like this. ,[adjusts her mirror],
,[Mr. Krabs pulls on Plankton. Plankton responds by stepping on Mr. Krabs' foot.],
,Mrs. Puff:, What?
,[Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Plankton stand there and smile. Mrs. Puff checks her mirror again. Mr. Krabs and Plankton beat each other up with spikey weapons.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Hm?
,[Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Plankton stand there and smile.],
,Mrs. Puff:, What's going on?
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, the two new students are— ,[gets corked in the mouth by Mr. Krabs and Plankton],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nothing. Nothing's going on.
,Plankton:, We swear.
,[Various weapons fall out of Mr. Krabs and Plankton. Mrs. Puff grumbles in anger. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, Plankton and SpongeBob on the test track in their boats.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Welcome to the test track. Now, I want you all to pull out slowly and carefully. Understand?
,Plankton:, Slowly and carefully. Got it. ,[starts the engine and laughs],
,[Mr. Krabs growls. The three students begin their driving, but Mr. Krabs and Plankton ram into SpongeBob.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Wha? ,[her apple falls out of her mouth],
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, Plankton and SpongeBob back on the test track in their boats again.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Now, don't—ah!
,[The three students begin their driving, but Mr. Krabs and Plankton ram into SpongeBob. Mrs. Puff becomes incredibly annoyed at their behavior. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, Plankton and SpongeBob back on the test track in their boats again.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Now these are my last boats and if you wreck 'em, none of you will pass my class. I can't believe I'm saying this, but be more like SpongeBob. He hasn't acted out once.
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, that's the nicest thing you've ever said about me. ,[hugs Mrs. Puff],
,Mrs. Puff:, Mm! Mm! ,[sees SpongeBob's boat drive away], SpongeBob, the parking brake!
,SpongeBob:, Yikes! Come back, boat!
,[SpongeBob chases after the boat as Mr. Krabs and Plankton start their driving. SpongeBob jumps into his boat. Plankton drives his boat and knocks over some safety cones in order to distract Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! ,[cones fly in his face], Ow, ow, ow, ooh, ow!
,[Plankton laughs. Mr. Krabs peaks through one of the cones and drives up the Plankton at a fast pace. They both swerve and sway at each other. Plankton drives his boat underground and gets in front of Mr. Krabs. They both swerve and sway again.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Stop! Stop! I'm gonna lose my teacher's license!
,Plankton:, ,[bashes his boat against Mr. Krabs], Can't catch me, Eugene! I'm the number one driver! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Well, good for you, Plankton!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't congratulate him, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, classmates support each other and he just said he's number one.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yeah? Then let's see him do this!
,[Mr. Krabs turns his boat around and drives up Mrs. Puff's lighthouse. Plankton takes notice of this.],
,Plankton:, That's easy. ,[turns his boat around and drives up Mrs. Puff's lighthouse as well],
,Mrs. Puff:, Come down from there right now!
,Mr. Krabs:, Never!
,Plankton:, I'm a god in this boat, on my way to heaven!
,[Mr. Krabs and Plankton drive their boats up Mrs. Puff's lighthouse like crazy maniacs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Top of the world!
,[Plankton laughs crazily as he drives. But when they reach the top, they realize that they're about to crash into each other.],
,Both:, Uh-oh.
,[They crash into each other with their boats and they fall straight to the ground, destroying the boats.],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[pants as she runs up to Mr. Krabs and Plankton], That's it! You both fail! ,[storms off],
,Plankton:, Oh, come on! Don't we at least deserve some credit for not getting hurt? I mean, that was crazy dangerous!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, it was!
,SpongeBob:, Hey guys, I finished that—,[his boat collides with Mr. Krabs and Plankton's boats, which resulted in a catastrophic explosion],
,[Plankton wakes up and finds himself hooked to the IV at the Bikini Bottom Hospital.],
,Plankton:, Wha—what happened?
,Doctor:, Mr. Plankton, you were in a horrible boat accident. It's a miracle that you're alive. However, there were some complications.
,Plankton:, Complications? What complications?
,Doctor:, Well, there was some confusion on what body parts went where.
,[Plankton looks around and sees himself stitched into Mr. Krabs' eye socket. He and Mr. Krabs scream.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, what's all the screaming up there? ,[reveals himself to be stitched underneath Mr. Krabs' head], Forget class, now we can be together forever! ,[laughs as Mr. Krabs and Plankton scream in agony],

"[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is making Krabby Patties when he pulls an instrument out of his pocket to check the tune],
,SpongeBob:, ,[whistles musically. The patties on the grill begin whistling along with him],
,Squidward:, ,[Sticks head through the window into the kitchen area], SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?
,SpongeBob:, Just a little grill-side harmony. Everyone knows that cooking and music go together like... eating and listening.
,Squidward:, You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that happened to Patrick once. He must've been listening to hard rock. ,[laughs], He had a lump on his head—
,Squidward:, I don't care! If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this. ,[inhales, plays clarinet off-key, customers jeering negative comments as they run out of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs takes the clarinet], Hey, give it back. I was just reaching my coda.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money.
,Squidward:, Fish flute?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I don't know. That's what they used to call it back in the—
,Squidward:, None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that happened to Patrick once, too! He—
,Squidward:, None of you know a great musician when you hear him! Not a single one of you! Not even—even—oh, there's nobody there.
,Plankton:, He's still doing it, Karen. He's— Karen?
,Karen:, Who's doing what, now?
,Plankton:, The skinny one. He's been ranting and raving in front of the Krusty Krab for the past half-hour, waving his arms and jumping around like an animal. Oh, he stopped now. He's just broken down on the ground, crying. Karen, Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!
,Karen:, What, the door on your way out?
,Plankton:, No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too.
,Karen:, ,[sighs], I warn you against it.
,Plankton:, Too late! ,[laughs evilly, whistles casually, clears throat],
,Squidward:, Who said that?
,Plankton:, Down here! I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have.
,Squidward:, Oh, really?
,Plankton:, Yes.
,Squidward:, Well, let me tell you something, mister. I know exactly who you are and why you're here.
,Plankton:, You do?
,Squidward:, You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is.
,Plankton:, Well, that's not exactly why I—
,Squidward:, Shameless. You again?
,Plankton:, I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day.
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], Why, yes, it is, isn't it?
,Plankton:, Yes, it—not buying that one either, huh?
,Squidward:, Nope. ,[Plankton knocks on door],
,Plankton:, Hey, buddy! ,[door slams], Squidward! ,[door slams], Free cleaning service? ,[door slams], Census taker. ,[door slams], Good day, kind sir. Would you like to buy some Gil Scout cookies? ,[door slams], Ow! ,[tape rips],
,Karen:, Plankton, what are you doing?
,Plankton:, There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish. ,[grunts], Ow! I knew I should've used pipe cleaners. Hello, I'm your long-lost relative. Can I have the secret formula? ,[Squidward kicks Plankton, door slams],
,Plankton:, Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Plankton. Nice dress.
,Plankton:, Out of my way, SpongeBrain.
,SpongeBob:, I overheard you and Squidward playing doorslam and I wanted to see if I could get in to the next round. ,[Plankton cries], Don't cry, Plankton. Doorslam is easy to play. Hard to master.
,Plankton:, None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever.
,SpongeBob:, Well, let's see. If you really want to impress Squidward, try talking to him about music.
,Plankton:, Music?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, especially his favorite kind of music, his own.
,Plankton:, Oh, is that right?
,Squidward:, ,[sings to himself, grumbles], Not again.
,Plankton:, Wait, don't irrigate me. I've come to hear your music. It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one.
,Squidward:, Are you sure you got the right squid?
,Plankton:, I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this: play for me. Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic. ,[eyelashes squish],
,Squidward:, Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance. I will play for you, my tiny cyclops. I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne... or whatever chair he's sitting on.
,Plankton:, Uh-oh. I mean, goodie.
,Squidward:, ,[inhales, plays his clarinet off-key, Plankton strains and growls],
,Plankton:, Sweet mother of Aphrodite! Please make it end!
,Squidward:, Huh, huh? How are you enjoying the music so far?
,Plankton:, It's delightful! ,[Squidward plays his clarinet off-key again, earplugs pop in Plankton's ears], Bravo! ,[whoops, whistles, claps], Encore, encore! Yes, yes, bravo, bravo! Whoo-hoo!

,Squidward:, I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance.
,Plankton:, Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to...
,Squidward:, Want to... sing?
,Plankton:, That's the word I was looking for!
,Squidward:, A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four. ,[jazzy music begins],
,Plankton:, ♪Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell. Shiny head is bulging he plays really well. On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet. This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet.♪ ,[Squidward plays riffs],♪To hear his music playing is like, uh, music to my ears. His delightful melodies reduce grown men to tears.

,Plankton:, Hooray!
,Squidward:, Thank you, thank you.
,Plankton:, Say, uh, musical genius?
,Squidward:, Yes?
,Plankton:, When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?
,Squidward:, It is an unfortunate truth.
,Plankton:, And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?
,Squidward:, That's an understatement.
,Plankton:, Well, I... I was just wondering, O incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?
,Squidward:, Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register. ,[plays clarinet],
,Plankton:, But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something.
,Squidward:, Nope. Haven't seen a thing. ,[continues playing],
,Plankton:, You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!
,Squidward:, Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician.
,Plankton:, What?
,Squidward:, It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed. ,[inhales, plays clarinet off-key, windows shatter],
,Mrs. Puff:, We have— ,[glass shattering],
,Sandy:, Mayday! Mayday!
,Squidward:, In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician.
,Plankton:, But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula. ,[growls, ear plugs pop], Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No! ,[earplugs sproing, Squidward begins to inhale, Plankton goes after the earplugs], Come back, I need you! ,[clarinet plays off-key; Plankton screams and takes the clarinet], Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!
,Squidward:, Hey! ,[panting], Come back!
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Squidward. I heard you and Plankton out here playing ""doorslam"" and I was wondering if I could—
,Squidward:, Plankton stole my clarinet and I have to get it back!
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! I wanna play!
,Plankton:, ,[pants], Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is. ,[laughs, he slides down a staircase with the clarinet and keeps running, SpongeBob and Squidward fall down and start to grunt and groan],

,Plankton:, You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!
,Police fish #1:, We've got you surrounded.
,Plankton:, You do? Oh.
,Police fish #1:, We've received hundreds of reports of an excruciating musical disturbance and you're the only one holding an instrument.
,Plankton:, Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life.

,[the two walk up to a TV which shows Sandy in a pink nightgown eating acorns],
,Patrick:, Look, she's on the Eating Channel.
,Sandy:, ,[On TV. Sandy fills her cheeks with acorns and swallows, wincing in pain as the giant mass of acorns passes down her long, thin neck and into her small torso, deforming it as it goes], Howdy! ,[eats more nuts], If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation. ,[""HIBERNATION"" appears on the bottom of the screen. Sandy eats more nuts], During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up.

,SpongeBob:, What is this stuff? ,[pan around the treedome],
,Patrick:, It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before.

,SpongeBob:, I guess you're right. It's okay here!
,Patrick:, Take it off. No one's looking. ,[SpongeBob does so and the two cheer and burrow themselves in the snow. They pop back up with noses made of snow. Then, they hear a weird sound], SpongeBob, did you hear that?

,Patrick:, ,[whacks SpongeBob], I'm Dirty Dan. ,[SpongeBob sees something behind Patrick and screams in terror], Screaming will get you nowh- ,[Sandy reaches out, grabs the top of Patrick's head and rips it off. Sandy huffs and growls as she stands behind Patrick, towering over him with sharpened teeth bared in a snarl],
,Sandy:, ,[breathing heavily], Which one of you fellers is the ,real, Dirty Dan?!
,Patrick:, Uh? I am? ,[bad idea, as Sandy promptly backhands him and sends him flying across the treedome],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! ,[Patrick slams against the dome hard enough to leave a dent and little drumsticks float around his head],
,Patrick:, Hot wings! ,[cut back to Sandy, who rounds on a cowering and terrified SpongeBob],
,Sandy:, Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours! ,[SpongeBob's pupils shrink in fear, he screams and jumps away to avoid it seconds before Sandy's fist obliterates where he was just sitting. Sandy throws her head back and bellows], ,PINHEEEEAAAADDDD!, ,[SpongeBob whimpers and runs, Sandy is close behind. SpongeBob later doesn't seem to be going far because he's right behind Sandy on the exercise wheel. He slips and gets flung across the wheel. He flies off and slams into the picnic table, leaving a giant crater in its place. Sandy leans over the crater], Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead! ,[SpongeBob picks up a wood board],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, stand back. I'm warning ya! ,[Sandy roars right in SpongeBob's face], Okay, I warned ya! ,[SpongeBob throws the wooden board, Patrick pops up beside Sandy],
,Patrick:, Did you win? ,[he's hit by the board and rolls down the crater to SpongeBob’s feet], Hi, SpongeBob! ,[Sandy growls before leaping into the crater. SpongeBob and Patrick cling onto each other in fear for their lives as a huge shadow covers them before a cloud obscures them, presumably simulating a fight. Cut to the treedome at night where two gravestones are in front of Sandy's Treedome: one for Dirty Dan and one for Pinhead Larry. Patrick and SpongeBob come up from under the snow in respective tombstone order], Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! ,[the two run to the door and SpongeBob tries to open it, but his hands slip off the wheel and accidentally hits Patrick in the face],
,Patrick:, Ouch! ,[covers his eyes in pain],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!
,Patrick:, Let me have a try. ,[he goes up to the door and spits on both hands, preparing to open the door], Open sesame! ,[nothing happens, Patrick shrugs], Well, I've done all I can do.
,SpongeBob:, Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring.
,Patrick:, Barnacles. ,[cut to much later, where SpongeBob and Patrick are completely buried in the snow, shivering and blue], Is it spring yet?
,SpongeBob:, N-n-n-no. ,[Patrick and SpongeBob's snow covering on their faces breaks off],
,Patrick:, I'm so cold that I'm shivering! ,[a piece of Patrick's side of his head cracks off, revealing his brain.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm so cold... ,[SpongeBob snaps off his two nose drippings and clicks them together], that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks!
,Patrick:, I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!
,SpongeBob:, Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! ,[SpongeBob begins to pull a strip of bark off the tree, but he is stopped by Sandy's booming voice],
,Sandy:, ,[off-screen], You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead! ,[SpongeBob quickly puts the strip back on and puts masking tape on it, whimpers. SpongeBob goes back to Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?
,Patrick:, Maybe she just ignores it.
,SpongeBob:, Maybe...
,Patrick:, Maybe...
,SpongeBob:, Maybe it's her fur! ,[cut to a shot of a real-life squirrel],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Yeah! ,[cut to inside the tree where SpongeBob and Patrick marvel at Sandy's fur],
,SpongeBob:, Look at all that warm, toasty fur.
,Patrick:, It's like a gold mine, but with fur. ,[SpongeBob slowly prepares to pluck a hair off Sandy],
,SpongeBob:, Carefully...carefully? ,[Patrick smacks him],
,Patrick:, Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!
,SpongeBob:, All right, all right, hang on a second! ,[he plucks one hair off and Sandy jumps up from her sleep and roars ferociously. Then goes back to sleep], That should be enough, right? ,[Patrick takes the hair],
,Patrick:, Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess I've lived a full life! ,[he plucks one more hair, causing the same reaction with Sandy],
,Patrick:, This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW! ,[he takes a piece of masking tape, places it on Sandy],
,SpongeBob:, Pat, no! ,[Patrick rips a patch of Sandy's fur off with the tape, leaving a patch of bare skin. Sandy roars and goes back to sleep, SpongeBob sighs in relief], Pat, are you crazy?! ,[we see that Patrick has placed the fur on his forehead],
,Patrick:, No, I'm warm.
,SpongeBob:, Let me see that roll of tape.
,[As we pan out from the tree, we hear the tape ripping out Sandy's fur and her roaring. Cut to later, Patrick comes out of the tree with a strip of hair on his forehead and his pants full of fur. SpongeBob comes out with big eyebrows and a goatee.],
,Patrick:, Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits. ,[he lifts his arm up, revealing fur under it],
,SpongeBob:, And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.
,Patrick:, You said it!
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Bring it on!
,[Just then, all the snow stops and melts. It's springtime again, flowers bloom.],
,SpongeBob:, Spring?
,Sandy:, ,[off screen. yawns], Wow, spring already?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick run frantically to the door, but the handle hasn't thawed yet],
,SpongeBob:, Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!
,Sandy:, ,[off-screen], I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically blow on the door handle until it melts. Sandy peeks out the window],
,Sandy:, Oh, look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!
,[With that, SpongeBob and Patrick go crazy trying to open the door. Patrick screams. Sandy walks over, completely hairless and in her bikini.],
,Sandy:, Hey, guys! ,[They climb off the door],
,[She sees all the different fur assortments the two are wearing. She looks down at her bald pink body and screams in horror.],
,SpongeBob:, It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! ,[Patrick hides his furry forehead piece. Sandy is really ticked now],
,Sandy:, ,[growling with fury], SpongeBob... Patrick...
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered.
,[He giggles nervously. Cut to Sandy's arm pouring some lemonade, she giggles.],
,Sandy:, ,[giggles], More lemonade, boys? ,[pan out to see that Patrick is curled around Sandy's head and SpongeBob is curled around Sandy's body, in order to cover up her bald pink hide. The two take a glass],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Thanks, Sandy.
,Sandy:, Spring ,sure, is lovely.

"[The episode begins at Sandy's treedome. Sandy is adding the finishing touches to her ship-in-a-bottle creation.],
,Sandy:, One more dang dab and she'll be done. She looks fine as cream gravy. With real workin' hearts.
,[The cannons in her bottle fire cannonballs. But they bounce back and destroy the ship.],
,Sandy:, ,[groans and pulls her ears in frustration], Two weeks down the drain! ,[throws her bottle out and takes her working goggles off], I can't win for losin'!
,[SpongeBob comes in and drinks the water from Sandy's bottle.],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks for the hot beverage. It was just what I needed. ,[sighs as he shows debris from the model ship in his teeth; he hears a noise upstairs], Sandy?
,[Sandy is rapidly chewing her furniture with her teeth like a beaver.],
,SpongeBob:, Yee-haw! You look madder than fried egg on a neckbone!
,Sandy:, ,[stops chewing], Don't even attempt a Texas saying!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry. What's going on?
,Sandy:, Oh, I wanted to win the ship-in-a-bottle contest tomorrow, but every one I make is a disaster. ,[shows a baby bottle with a capsized kiddie boat], My kiddie boat in a baby bottle capsized. ,[shows a raft deflated in a deflated bottle], My raft in an inflatable bottle deflated. ,[shows a tanker in a water cooler bottle leaking oil], And my tanker in a water cooler bottle had an oil spill! Now, I'm all fresh out of bottles!
,[SpongeBob pulls out a bottle containing the Krabby Patty secret formula. He takes the paper and throws it out the window. He then hands the empty bottle to Sandy.],
,SpongeBob:, Here's a fresh bottle you can use.
,Sandy:, ,[takes the bottle], Did you just—
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps as he realizes his mistake], I did! ,[peaks out and sees the formula is gone], The secret formula!
,[SpongeBob runs out and heads for the Bikini Bottom Airport.],
,Airport announcer:, Flight 291 is now boarding. All passengers please proceed to Gate 4.
,Pilot:, We're good to take-off.
,[SpongeBob enters the plane moments before take-off. The plane takes-off and flies into the sky. SpongeBob jumps out of the plane and lands into a cable car. The cable car takes SpongeBob to a devilish volcanic mountain that is shaped like Plankton. SpongeBob bursts through the door and sees Plankton trying to untie the rope and read the paper. He snatches the paper from Plankton.],
,SpongeBob:, Gimme that!
,[SpongeBob turns and leaves with the secret formula, not before giving Plankton a death ray stare. SpongeBob exits the mountain before it erupts with lava. SpongeBob is sent flying back to Sandy's treedome in a ball of fire. He hits the dome glass and is completely singed. But luckily, the formula is unharmed.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew! That was close. ,[puts the formula away],
,[The scene changes to Sandy adding a bit of glue to her model ship.],
,Sandy:, And done! Did you bring me a bottle?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh! ,[opens his mouth and sticks out a bigger bottle], I borrowed one from Plankton before riding a fireball back here.
,[Sandy attempts to fit her model ship in the bottle, but it's too small.],
,Sandy:, ,[groans], This won't fit.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sure it will.
,[SpongeBob pushes the model ship in the bottle, but he accidentally ruins it.],
,Little sailor:, Jump for your life!
,[Two tiny sailors jump into the water and are surrounded by sharks. SpongeBob places the bottle on the shelf and puts a note saying ""Men Overboard"" in front of it.],
,SpongeBob:, Men overboard. ,[chuckles nervously],
,[Sandy chews on the table in frustration. SpongeBob pulls the table back.],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy? Uh, Sandy, I have an idea. Let's call Mr. Krabs. I bet he knows all about ships in bottles. ,[holds out a black-and-white picture of Mr. Krabs kissing a bag of money], He was once a sailor.
,Sandy:, I don't need anybody's help! Sandy Cheeks flies alone! ,[bangs on the table and it crumbles], Alright, call him up.
,[The scene changes to Sandy telling Mr. Krabs her dilemma.],
,Sandy:, Seriously, Mr. Krabs. I don't see what you can teach me.
,Mr. Krabs:, First lesson is math. I get half the prize money!
,Sandy:, What the? I'll give you 100% of my fist!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets in between Sandy and Mr. Krabs], Uh, 50% sounds fair.
,Sandy:, Well, I do wanna win. Okay, 50%.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[pulls out a chart of making the bottle], First step: create the perfect bottle.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, my two friends working together! I gotta get a picture for this. ,[sees Fiasco painting a picture of Mr. Krabs and Sandy and takes it], Thank you!
,[Fiasco grumbles in anger. The scene changes to Sandy doing some glassblowing in hopes of making the perfect bottle for her model ship.],
,Mr. Krabs:, First, we build a furnace to make the bottles.
,[Sandy pulls out the molten glass from the furnace. She takes a deep breath and blows the glass into a shoe. She does it the second time and blows it into a human brain. She does it the third time and blows it into a sea shell. She does it the fourth time and makes it into the bottle she needed for her ship.],
,Sandy:, Perfect and slick as a whistle. ,[blows in the bottle and makes a whistle; she shows the bottle to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm. ,[takes out a hammer and smashes the bottle], Try again.
,[Sandy growls in disgust. She makes another bottle and shows it to Mr. Krabs.],
,Sandy:, Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[smashes the bottle with the hammer], Try again.
,[Sandy makes another bottle and shows it to Mr. Krabs. This time, Mr. Krabs is on a swing.],
,Sandy:, Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[smashes the bottle with the hammer], Try again.
,[Sandy makes another bottle.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[smashes the bottle with the hammer], Try again.
,[Sandy makes another bottle.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[smashes the bottle with the hammer], Try again.
,[Sandy makes another bottle.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[smashes the bottle with the hammer], Try again.
,[She makes one more bottle and is breathing heavily in anger. Mr. Krabs holds out the hammer and goes to hit the bottle. Sandy cowers as he is going to strike at the bottle. This time, Mr. Krabs doesn't destroy it. He sees it as the perfect bottle for the model ship.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Perfect!
,Sandy:, Whew!
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, we can start on the ship. ,[accidentally smashes her bottle with the hammer], Oh, wait, um, I wasn't supposed to break that one with it.
,Sandy:, ,[whimpers and is completely worn out], I feel like chewed-up twine. I'm goin' to bed. And you could forget about the prize money, 'cause the contest is tomorrow.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[spits his soda out in surprise], Tomorrow?! ,[cries as his tears fill up his water helmet], Me prize money! Hey, mind if I take a crack at this ship bottle thing?
,Sandy:, Knock yourself out. ,[closes the door],
,[Mr. Krabs desperately looks around for something to build, but sees nothing.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I got nothin' to work with here. ,[sees Sandy's tree and comes up with an idea as his eyes turn into bottles with money in them], Oh! ,[giggles], That prize money is as good as mine! ,[giggles],
,[The scene changes to the next morning. Sandy wakes up from her sleep, yawns and stretches. A crow next to her is cawing loudly. She hits the crow and it flies off. She looks around and sees herself standing in the main mast of the ship Mr. Krabs built himself.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy, matey!
,Sandy:, ,[jumps down from the mast], What is all this?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[throws his tools away], Hang on. Just let me show ya! ,[grabs Sandy's hand, puts her in her water suit and takes her outside her dome], Ta-da! ,[shows her the ship-in-a-bottle outside of her treedome], It's the biggest ship-in-a-bottle ever! It's sure to win the contest!
,Sandy:, That's amazing, Mr. Krabs! You got some ,[elbows Mr. Krabs], snap in your old garters after all! Yee-haw! We're gonna win for sure! Woo-hoo! ,[she and Mr. Krabs dance around for a bit], By the way, where'd you get all the wood?
,Mr. Krabs:, I chopped down your tree.
,Sandy:, ,[sighs], That's great. ,[pauses], You what?! ,[gasps],
,[Sandy turns and sees all of her nooks and crannies from her tree nailed onto the ship Mr. Krabs built.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-oh. ,[backs away],
,Sandy:, ,[her shock turns to anger], Why you low-down, no good, bottom-dwellin'—! ,[Mr. Krabs runs away], Dadgummit! Come back here! You wanna see what I'm gonna do to you?! ,[chews a nearby boulder and forms it into Mr. Krabs], First, I'm gonna do this! ,[karate chops the statue], Then, I'm gonna do this! ,[kicks the statue],
,[Mr. Krabs hops in his boat and reverses it up to the front door of Sandy's treedome. He ties the door with the chain and begins driving away with it.],
,Mr. Krabs:, My work, my prize money. Eugene Krabs flies alone!
,Sandy:, ,[gasps], What?! ,[screams as she sees her dome being dragged away by Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Blow a kiss, jellyfish! ,[cackles as he drives away with Sandy's treedome],
,Sandy:, She-oot! He is more slippery than a pocket full of puddin'. I'm-a comin' for my ship-in-a-bottle, Krabs! ,[activates the button on her suit and her submarine emerges from the ground; she hops into her submarine and proceeds to chase after Mr. Krabs], Yee-haw! We got ourselves a good old-fashioned high speed chase and Texas barbecue! ,[flips some acorns on the grill with her spatula and plays chase music on her radio],
,Driver:, Look out!
,[People on the streets panic as Sandy's treedome nearly hits them. Mr. Krabs sees Sandy's submarine heading towards him.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hard to port!
,[Mr. Krabs swerves the boat left and right before turning and damaging some buildings. One building sends Sandy's submarine crashing through the roof of the Krusty Krab, leaving a gapping hole. Sandy backs-up her submarine through the front, which leaves another hole in the restaurant.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[comes out with a Krabby Patty], Order up! Okay, who's eating—,[sees the hole], Ooh, al fresco.
,Sandy:, ,[loads her compartment with acorns as ammunition], I was saving these for lunch. But now is a good a time as ever to start a diet. ,[closes the compartment door and pushes the launch button],
,[Sandy's submarine fires the acorns through at straw at Mr. Krabs. Sandy keeps firing the acorns at Mr. Krabs until one big one clobbers his back.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[screams], Clap of thunder! ,[his shell cracks and breaks], Is that all you got? Hmm? Oh no. ,[gets crushed by Sandy's submarine], Oh, why did I ask that question?
,Sandy:, ,[comes out through the hatch], Yee-hoo! This ain't my first rodeo! ,[holds up her rodeo championship belt], This is my 500th rodeo!
,[Sandy jumps off and hops onto the chain connecting her treedome to Mr. Krabs' boat. She takes off her helmet and goes to chew on the chain, which also catching some breathing through her helmet. Unfortunately, Mr. Krabs lifts Sandy's submarine up with his claws.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Silly mammal! You forget that crabs are stronger than woodchucks! ,[throws Sandy's submarine out in the distance],
,Sandy:, That old crab's got more guts than you can hang on a fence. ,[jumps off the chain and goes after her submarine], This ain't over, Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hmm...There ain't no sadder sight than a rodent runnin' after her submarine.
,[Mr. Krabs proceeds to drive the treedome to the ship-in-a-bottle contest. But as he drives, he destroys several boats and sets them on fire. Meanwhile at the ship-in-a-bottle contest, many contestants are displaying their ship-in-a-bottle creations. The judge is going around looking at everything and is examining them to see which is the best. He sees one without a model ship in it.],
,Judge:, Hmm. What happened here?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm still waiting for my ship to come in. ,[laughs],
,[Patrick disgustedly shakes his head at SpongeBob as he didn't find his joke funny. Outside, Mr. Krabs drives the treedome toward the building and puts the brake on. But the treedome slams into Mr. Krabs and it pushes him towards the building. People, who are standing outside the building, scream and run away.],
,Kid:, You think we'll win, Dad?
,Kid's father:, Hard work is its own reward, son. Or should I say Admiral?
,[Mr. Krabs and the treedome crash through the wall. Mr. Krabs crashes his boat into the fountain.],
,Contestant:, Look out!
,[The treedome swerves around, destroying everyone else's ship-in-a-bottle creations in the process. As the smoke clears, everyone looks and glares at Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs], So, what do you think, Judge? Ain't she a beauty? A ship in a glass bottle of epic proportions!
,Judge:, Hmm. Well, it is rather impressive. But more importantly, it's the only intact ship-in-a-bottle here. I have no choice but to declare you the winner. ,[hands Mr. Krabs the trophy containing the prize money],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right. Hand it over! ,[grabs the trophy and rubs the prize money on his face while sighing],
,[Suddenly, Sandy comes flying in with her submarine, causing havoc all over the place.],
,Sandy:, Ya-hoo!
,[Sandy crashes her submarine into her treedome and destroys Mr. Krabs' model ship. Then she crashes her submarine into the fountain and is ejected out. She slips out of her watersuit and rolls over towards the judge's feet in her air helmet. The judge picks her up and looks at her. Sandy giggles nervously as she's expecting to judge to be angry at her.],
,Judge:, Wow, this is unprecedented. But since there are no more ships-in-a-bottle to judge, I'm forced to give the prize to this squirrel-in-a-bottle.
,[The audience cheers and gives Sandy a round of applause. Sandy has indeed won the ship-in-a-bottle contest as well as the prize money after all.],
,Sandy:, Yee-haw!
,[The scene changes back to Sandy's treedome. Mr. Krabs is punished for his malicious actions and is sent to do long hours of community service around Sandy's treedome. For starters, he is forced to build her a temporary tree until a new one grows.],
,Sandy:, ,[counting her prize money], That temporary tree should do until the seed I planted grows into a new one. ,[pushes the seed in the flower pot and plants it],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sweating to the bone], Whew!
,Sandy:, Let's go, you bag of shells! I want you jumpin' like hot grease on a skillet! ,[pushes the button on her remote and activates Mr. Krabs' electric collar],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gets zapped by his electric collar], Ha, ha, sorry, Ms. Cheeks. Okay, I'll be right—,[gets zapped again], Hee, hee, ha, okay, I'm—uh, I'm workin'! I'm—,[gets zapped again],

,[As the wooden airplane flies around in a circle, the rope starts to ravel around the pole, getting the airplane tangled on it.],
,SpongeBob:, Did I do it?
,Sandy:, Hmm. Good enough.
,[Sandy stamps the word ""Ready"" on her checklist. The scene changes to the Bikini Bottom Air Show where pilots are preparing to entertain the audience with their planes. SpongeBob walks into the arena with a pilot suit on and is ready to perform in the show. He sees an old man on a wheel chair, coughing. SpongeBob rushes over to meet him.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, you must be Pen Pal!
,Frail Fish:, ,[coughs],
,SpongeBob:, What an honor it is to finally meet you! Oh, you pretty, pretty pen pal you.
,Frail Fish:, Hmm? ,[coughs],
,SpongeBob:, I just wanted to say that today... Today... ,[reads the writing on his hand], ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life. I promise to fly to the best of my ability just for you."" Oh, I will not let you down.
,Frail Fish:, ,[coughs and then punches his chest],
,[SpongeBob punches his chest as if he believes that he is putting his hand on his heart.],
,SpongeBob:, My heart is full too, Pen Pal. ,[sniffs], My heart is full too.
,[SpongeBob runs back to the starting line. The old man coughs up a Krabby Patty that had been stuck in his throat.],
,Frail Fish:, Whew! That was a close one! What was that guy talking about? ,[eats Krabby Patty],
,Announcer:, Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! Feast your eyes upon one daring, death-defying, the Polaris, the incredible, flying sponge!
,[The audience cheers],
,SpongeBob:, Take off. Don't die. Fly a few seconds lower to the ground. Don't die. Slam. Don't die. So simple.
,[Something taps SpongeBob on his shoulder. SpongeBob turns around and sees a strange figure that looked like the grim reaper. SpongeBob shrieks.],
,Steve:, ,[uncovers his hood], Steve's the name and scythes on the game! You need a scythe? Steve's got ya covered! One scythe fits all!
,Sandy:, Get outta here, Steve!
,Steve:, ,[walks away], Oh, I gotta say in it.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, I'm nervous.
,[Sandy gives SpongeBob a pair of underpants.],
,SpongeBob:, No, it's still not that.
,Sandy:, Don't worry, SpongeBob. You'll be, uh, just fine. Yeah.
,[Sandy backs away and walks over to a group of firefighters and paramedics.],
,Sandy:, Get ready, boys! The bronco is loose! I repeat, the bronco is loose!
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at the control panel in nervousness], Just fine.
,[SpongeBob presses several buttons and the plane begins to warm up.],
,SpongeBob:, Pen Pal, this one's for you.
,[SpongeBob's plane drives down the runway and slowly begins to take off. SpongeBob pulls down the lever and the plane starts to fly. The audience cheers in astonishment.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo-hoo! I'm flying! Yee-haw!
,[Suddenly, to SpongeBob's surprise, Patrick is running on the runway below him.],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob! I can't believe you can actually fly like you said in your letter!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick? You're Pen Pal?
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Duh! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, But... but you said you were dying! You're not dying!
,Patrick:, Dying? Oh, oh! You didn't read the whole letter!
,SpongeBob:, ,[pulls out the letter], See? It says, ""I wish I could watch you fly because I am dying!""
,Patrick:, ,[pulls out his second letter], And here's the second page! ""To see you as a real pilot, SpongeBob. Here are some other things I like to see: candy rain, a firetruck full of clowns, and... a bunch of other stuff.""
,SpongeBob:, It all makes sense now! ,[laughs], Oh, Patrick! ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs as his letter slips off his hands], You thought I was dying!
,[As SpongeBob laughs, Patrick's second half of his letter flies into SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob screams in fear and he accidentally makes to plane fly out of control. The plane's wing scoops Patrick up and Patrick falls into the cockpit. The plane turns around and gets its landing gear caught on a candy stand. SpongeBob continues to scream until Patrick takes the letter off SpongeBob's face.],
,Patrick:, Watch out!
,[SpongeBob's sees that his plane is flying straight towards Sandy, the firefighters and the paramedics. SpongeBob desperately tries to control the plane and makes it fly upwards. The plane is now flying upside down and begins to rain candy from the candy stand as the firefighters gives a chase.],
,Patrick:, Candy rain, check!
,[The plane then flies towards a food vendor with two children. The kids and the vendor ran away and the plane flies upwards. The candy stand hits the ice cream stand and splatters ice cream all over Sandy and the firefighters, making them appear with clown faces.],
,Patrick:, Firetruck clowns, check!
,[The plane then flies into a flower-shaped cloud and bounces back and forth. The plane then spirals out of control and flies directly into a first class airplane.],
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me!
,[SpongeBob's plane comes out of the first class airplane. The airplane splits into two halves.],
,Passengers and crew:, Heave-ho!
,[The passengers and crew pulls the airplane back in place.],
,Patrick:, Fly first class, check!
,[SpongeBob's plane turns around. SpongeBob and Patrick gasps in horror when they see the plane's left wing is falling apart.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, something's wrong with the plane! Here, take the controls!
,[SpongeBob jumps out of the cockpit and goes to fix the wing.],
,Patrick:, Take what now?
,[Patrick grabs on the handle. SpongeBob fixes the wing and the plane continues to fly out of control. The plane then scoops up Abigail Marge, who is playing tennis with Sadie, and Perry, who is acting as referee. The firetruck with Sandy and the firefighters continues chasing after SpongeBob's plane. SpongeBob and Abigail play tennis as the plane continues to fly. SpongeBob hits the tennis ball and accidentally breaks Abigail's racket.],
,Perry:, Match point, SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, Whoo-hoo! Check and check!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Hey, Patrick. Who's flying the plane?!
,Patrick:, I am!
,[SpongeBob runs back into the cockpit.],
,Patrick:, No, wait.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick both hop in the cockpit. The plane begins to break down and shakes Abigail and Perry off. Sandy and the firefighters catch Perry and Abigail with a safety net. The plane flies around and is now driven off course.],
,SpongeBob:, Hold on! We're going down!
,[SpongeBob's plane breaks down and descends downward. SpongeBob and Patrick scream in terror. But just as the plane is about to hit the ground, it stops in midair. SpongeBob and Patrick stop screaming. SpongeBob sees that the plane's gas tank is completely empty.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew! We ran out of gas.
,Patrick:, Uh, don't worry! I've got this! ,[fills SpongeBob's plane with gas], Yep!
,[SpongeBob's plane starts up again and smashes into the ground. Sandy and the firefighters arrive and try to put out the fire caused by the plane crash. SpongeBob and Patrick exit the plane unharmed.],
,Patrick:, Thanks for helping me finish my list, SpongeBob.
,[Sandy gives SpongeBob a pair of underpants. This time, SpongeBob takes it.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, it was my pleasure.
,Patrick:, Really? Well, if you don't mind, I have a couple of other things I'd like to see. ,[pulls out his list],
,SpongeBob:, Let's hear 'em.
,Patrick:, ,[reads list], ""An edible balloon, a skateboarding snail, a tower of loose meat that tastes like ice cream, some ghosts...""
,[As SpongeBob and Patrick walk off into the sunset, Sandy and the firefighters struggle to put out the fire while two planes and a blimp fly around in the sky and people running around in panic, thus ending the episode.],

"[Episode starts at the night view of Bikini Bottom with a scallop on the sign, then a view of Squidward's house, with a light now turned on. Squidward picks up a remote and sits on his couch],

,Announcer:, Our programming will begin shortly.

What could possibly be more enriching? ,[as he drinks his coffee, guitar music starts playing, the house starts shaking and Squidward spits out coffee], What?! ,[a man continues to play the guitar on TV. He's then lit on fire, and then explodes and a title card comes up saying ""The Guitar Lord"".],
,Zeus:, Hey. I'm Zeus the Guitar Lord. I don't have a guitar yet. But if I did, I would want a really killer one like this! ,[pulls out a paper, showing a red guitar],
,Squidward:, ,[He scoffs. In an angered tone], He obviously doesn't know the first thing about music! This is an outrage!

,Squidward:, ,[angrily], Where is my ""Fab and Fancy?!""
,Zeus:, Your... what?
,Squidward:, I'm quite certain you wouldn't know culture if it bit you on the guitar!
,Zeus:, Uh... hummm... I don't have a guitar.
,Squidward:, Do they just give a show to just anybody over there?
,Zeus:, Pretty much. My mom gave me this one for my birthday.
,Squidward:, ,[surprised], Really?
,Zeus:, Yeah. I wanted a guitar or a star named after me... but you know, whatever. I guess a TV show is cool.
,Squidward:, It's that easy? ,[hangs up phone and dials a number], Hello? Bikini Bottom Public Access? ,[excitedly], Give me a TV show! Give me a TV show! I want a show! ,[cut to the Krusty Krab later], Come on! Just a few more minutes, Squiddie, and it will be your turn to bask in the lime light! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Ohhh, yeah! Oh, lime light basking! Baskin' in the lime light! ,[laughs], Oh, good times. Good times. ,[turns to Squidward], So, where will said basking take place?
,Squidward:, ,[angrily], Like, I would tell you! Hmph... ,[thinking], Although, I've waited my whole life to have enough glory to rub it in someone's face. Anyone's face. ,[turns to SpongeBob who winks. He shivers.], Even that face. Okay! I'll tell you, but the last thing I would want is for you to show up so plug your ears! ,[shoves Krabby Patties in SpongeBob's ears], Well, I don't want to toot my own whistle, but... Wait, no!

,SpongeBob:, TV? ,[leaves happily],
,Squidward:, Moron. As I was saying, today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing...

,Squidward:, This isn't happening!
,Patrick:, I'm not on TV! ,[rushes back into Squidward's house], SpongeBob! I went home and turned on my TV, but... I wasn't on the TV. Why did you lie to me, SpongeBob? Why?
,Squidward:, ,[annoyingly], Patrick, just how dumb are you?
,Patrick:, It varies.
,Squidward:, If you want to be on TV, you have to be in front of the camera!
,Patrick:, Ohhh. I get it! ,[rushes to camera, giggling], Hi, TV people! ,[puts his face on the lens, then shows his mouth], And my mouth is on TV! ,[a live action shot of the inside of a person's mouth is shown on a television set],

,Patrick:, ,[licks and bites the lens], SpongeBob! You gotta try this! ,[they both play with the camera and laugh],
,Squidward:, Patrick, SpongeBob, get off my camera! ,[gets Patrick off the camera, but Patrick falls onto Squidward. Squidward growls and pushes Patrick off of him], Would you get out of here?
,Patrick:, ,[scratching his head], Doubt it. ,[Squidward slaps his head and sighs],
,Squidward:, If you like the camera so much, why don't you be the camera man?
,Patrick:, Camera man?
,Squidward:, That means you take all the pretty pictures. ,[makes air quotes],

"SpongeBob:, Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day! ,[SpongeBob's hand appears from a sand castle pineapple with his face drawn on his hand], I wonder if Patrick's at home.
,Patrick:, Hiya, SpongeBob! ,[Patrick's hand comes over from a sand castle rock with his face drawn on his hand], Whatcha doin'?
,SpongeBob:, Goin' over to Sandy's place. ,[both hands walk off together and arrive at a sand-made treedome], Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
,Sandy:, Don't lose your barnacles, boys. Hi-yah! ,[Chops sand castle peak down making a sand image of Texas], There it is!

,Sandy:, Can't you see? It's Texas.

,Sandy:, Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.

,SpongeBob:, But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
,Sandy:, ,[gets on a bus], I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
,SpongeBob:, No, no! Wait! Sandy! ,[the bus drives off], I can't believe she's gone.

,Patrick:, Uhh, stupid?
,SpongeBob:, No, I'm Texas!
,Patrick:, What's the difference?! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh],
,Sandy:, ,[drops suitcases], Y'all best apologize, or I'm gonna be on you like ugly on an ape!
,SpongeBob:, You'll have to catch us first! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick run off], We did it! We got her!
,Patrick:, Krusty Krab, here we come! ,[turns head around to Sandy], Can we say that ,plants, from Texas are dumb? Can we say that ,shoes, from Texas are dumb?
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
,Patrick:, Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... ,[...catch up, which she is. And fast. Patrick's eyes bug out and he screams],
,SpongeBob:, Run faster, Patrick! ,[both of them scream; they go around each side of a huge rock. Sandy crashes right through the rock, obliterating it, and walks with a twirling rope. Her shoe engulfs the screen, Sandy ropes Patrick and brings him into the background],

,Sandy:, ,[takes out the flusher handle, attaches it to her helmet and flushes the water out again], I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. ,[Everyone gathers around Sandy],
,Sandy:, Huh? Duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.

Although, I have to deduct points for that landing though.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[inflates], That's it! I don't care anymore! This isn't worth it! ,[bounces out, shattering the Krusty Krab doors and bouncing into her car], I will not be humiliated any longer! ,[stares at the note],
,SpongeBob:, Don't forget to read the note!
,Mrs. Puff:, YOU! It's because of ,you, I got stuck in this mess! ,[rips note and throws it on the ground],
,Police:, Hold it right there! Well, well, well, if it ain't Mrs. Puff. I saw what you did.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[gulps], I. You did?
,Police:, Yeah.
,Mrs. Puff ,[nervously], Oh please! I didn't mean to do it! I swear!
,Police:, It's too late for swearing Puff! The evidence is right here. ,[points at ripped paper], You littered, now you're going to the stony lonesome.
,Mrs. Puff:, Littered? You're absolutely right, officer! Yes! I sure did litter! That's what I did!
,Police:, Yeah, all right. You're under arrest now.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[police cuffs her], No problem, officer, time by myself in the stoney lonesome is just what I need!
,Police:, Tell it to the judge, Mrs. Puff! ,[police car drives away as Mrs. Puff laughs. She marks a tally],
,Mrs. Puff:, 1 day down, 2,528 to go! That's just shy of 4 years without SpongeBob! I'm going to enjoy this!
,Police:, Get up, Puff! The judge says you have to go to traffic school.
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, wow! A Driver's Education class! This is just how I made a living except without HIM. Delightful!
,SpongeBob:, Good day, class! ,[Mrs. Puff looks over and screams and smacks herself with a book],
,Mrs. Puff:, I must be having a nightmare! What's he doing here?!
,SpongeBob:, Didn't you read the note, Mrs. Puff? Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case. ,[reads the note], Dear Mrs. Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer. ♥ SpongeBob. 
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[screams], Get me outta here! ,[She tries to escape, but the policeman gets her and cuffs her leg to the chair],
,SpongeBob:, Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1. ,[Mrs. Puff sobs uncontrollably. Episode ends],

"SpongeBob:, ,[He is asleep in bed and dreaming that he is standing on a giant Krabby Patty, then black storm clouds roll in and it starts to rain Krabby Patties. One falls into his hands], Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah! ,[runs around eating patties. Dream ends. SpongeBob wakes up to see himself chewing on his pillow. He spits it out and his stomach growls], A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed. ,[kicks the pillow on the ground and jumps on it. Sees Gary meowing in his sleep], Aww, sleep tight, my little angel. ,[tip-toes past Gary. He tries to get down the stairs without waking up Gary but goes down really fast making a xylophone sound. He walks to the fridge], Ah, here it is. ,[grabs a jar of seanut butter out of the fridge and walks to the counter where there is food and utensils lying on it], Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to help you get to sleep. ,[as soon as SpongeBob takes a bite of the sandwich, he falls asleep. Behind him, the fridge is open and cold air comes out of it. In the morning, his whole house is frozen. The foghorn alarm clock breaks the ice. SpongeBob wakes up also shivering.], The fridge! ,[slides over and closes the fridge door, then sits down trying to get warm. He tries to stand up, but he slips and slides everywhere inside the house, and he breaks all the windows before stopping on his bed. He pulls the frozen covers over him, but the blanket breaks into pieces],
,Gary:, ,[wearing a hat and ear muffs], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[slides into the bathroom], Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me. ,[He sneezes. Pink bubbles come out of him],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I can't get the suds, ,[sniffles], because then I'll have to miss work! ,[puts his underwear over his mouth and nose then sneezes. Pink bubbles come out again],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this. ,[turns around and has two bubbles representing his butt cheeks. Each one pops],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I'm not sick. I'm going to work. ,[at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is cooking when he sneezes loudly and he pulls entire hat over his head to muffle it. Mr. Krabs comes into the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties? ,[SpongeBob turns around looking pale],
,SpongeBob:, ,[weakly, visibly shaking], Right away, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse. ,[Gary pops out of nowhere],
,Gary:, Meow. ,[leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, The suds?
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up the Krabby Patty on a plate], Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir. ,[sneezes loudly, causing the patty to splatter all over Mr. Krabs' face],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[wipes the patty off his face], Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work.
,SpongeBob:, No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest. ,[Mr. Krabs opens the front door],
,Mr. Krabs:, No, now go home and get some rest. ,[SpongeBob walks off], Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food! ,[customers overhear what Mr. Krabs just said and all spit out their food and panic], No, wait! Wait! ,[The customers run out of the Krusty Krab. Back at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob is in his chair.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary, I feel horrible. ,[sneezes. Gary hides in his shell with pink bubbles all over his shell. Gary has an angry expression when he shows his eyes], Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it. ,[after he sneezes again, his right eye rolls down his face], I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand. ,[picks up the phone and dials Sandy's number],
,Sandy:, ,[running on her exercise wheel], Hello?
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, I'm sick. ,[puts his eye back into place], Can you escort me to the doctor's?
,Sandy:, Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I'll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in...
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks. ,[sneezes pink bubbles through Sandy's phone. Later, as SpongeBob is getting dressed for the doctor, the doorbell rings], Coming. ,[opens the door],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?
,SpongeBob:, I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.
,Patrick:, What? Oh, you can't go!
,SpongeBob:, Why not, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sits in his chair], It can't be as horrible as the suds. ,[sneezes],
,Patrick:, Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well, first, they make you sit in the waiting room.
,SpongeBob:, Is that the horrible part, Patrick? ,[Gary appears beside the chair],
,Patrick:, No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines! ,[SpongeBob gasps. Patrick takes a piece of coral for a stethoscope], Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.
,SpongeBob:, No!
,Patrick:, Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it... ,[takes the end of the piece of coral and puts it on SpongeBob's chest], Ssssss! ,[SpongeBob jumps and runs around],
,SpongeBob:, No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No! ,[flips over on the floor], Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.
,Patrick:, Exactly. ,[SpongeBob sneezes. A pink bubble is in the place where Patrick's nose should be, then it pops],
,SpongeBob:, You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
,Patrick:, What else are friends for? ,[later, SpongeBob is sitting on the table in his kitchen. Patrick is standing behind him. SpongeBob sneezes], It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick. ,[pushes a small cork in one of SpongeBob's holes. Then plugs up the rest of the holes with more corks], Voilà! ,[SpongeBob sneezes, but no bubble come out], Feel better?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. ,[he sneezes more and more, which after every sneeze he enlarges himself],
,Patrick:, Help, I'm shrinking! ,[SpongeBob breaks the table], No! Please don't hurt me!
,SpongeBob:, No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
,Patrick:, You think so?
,SpongeBob:, Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!
,Patrick:, And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.
,SpongeBob:, ,[tries to press one button, but it pressed all because his fingers are too large], My fingers are too big for the buttons. ,[off-hook tone plays], Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me? ,[gives Patrick the phone],
,Patrick:, Sure, patient SpongeBob. ,[Patrick calls Sandy, who is about to head out for SpongeBob's place], Hello, Sandy?
,Sandy:, Hiya, Patrick.
,Patrick:, I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.
,Sandy:, I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital.
,Patrick:, Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.
,Sandy:, Well, I'm coming over to take a look. I'll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot...
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy! ,[hangs up], Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! Ah! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor! ,[runs into the kitchen with rubber gloves on and dips them into the sink of water], Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please. ,[takes some sea-nut butter and spreads it on SpongeBob's right foot. Then puts a piece of bread on each side and his shoe on it], Feeling better?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-uh. ,[later, a string is attached to a door that Patrick closes. A tooth shoots out from the side],
,Patrick:, Feeling better yet?
,SpongeBob:, ,[missing a tooth], Not really.
,Patrick:, ,[jumping on SpongeBob in a ballet outfit], How...about...now?
,SpongeBob:, I don't...think so. ,[Patrick puts a big band-aid on SpongeBob's back],
,Patrick:, Feeling better?
,SpongeBob:, No. ,[Patrick rips the band-aid off while SpongeBob screams and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob's back],
,Patrick:, How about now?
,SpongeBob:, Nope. ,[Patrick rips the band-aid off as SpongeBob screams again and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob's back],
,Patrick:, How about now?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-uh. ,[Patrick rips the band-aid off as SpongeBob screams. Later, Sandy arrives outside SpongeBob's house],
,Sandy:, Hello, SpongeBob?
,Patrick:, ,[wears a black mask on his head], Uh-oh, it's Sandy. ,[SpongeBob is tied onto a medieval machine. He sneezes and enlarges himself into a ball. Sandy knocks on the door], There's no one home.
,Sandy:, Patrick, you open this door. ,[Patrick is rolling SpongeBob away], Patrick, sometimes I just don't understand you. ,[SpongeBob sneezes], Hey! ,[walks over to Patrick's house], Okay, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?
,Patrick:, Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.
,Sandy:, Okay, now tell me, ,[shows two rocks], since when do you have two houses?
,Patrick:, Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.
,Sandy:, Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when does your house have feet? ,[SpongeBob's feet are sticking out of the other rock],
,Patrick:, This is my mobile home. ,[SpongeBob sneezes the rock off],
,SpongeBob:, Hiya, Sandy.
,Patrick:, ,[holding SpongeBob's hand], Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.
,Sandy:, Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor.
,Patrick:, No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.
,SpongeBob:, Ahh... ,[a green substance-like gas spreads outs all over killing the plants, clams, and everything in its path],
,Sandy:, See? He's even worse than I thought.
,Patrick:, ,[wearing a clothespin on his nose], What do you mean? He's fine. ,[Sandy takes the clothespin off of his nose],
,SpongeBob:, I'm okay, Sandy, really. ,[sneezes again, enlarging himself more],
,Sandy:, I'm taking you to the doctor right now. ,[rolls SpongeBob away],
,Patrick:, Hey, that's my patient! ,[runs over and pushes SpongeBob the opposite way], You can't take him to the doctor's.
,Sandy:, ,[rolling SpongeBob the other way again], Don't be silly, Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[carrying SpongeBob the other way], He's mine! ,[Sandy is log rolling SpongeBob the opposite way],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, you'll be better soon. ,[Patrick is using a wheelbarrow for SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, I'll save you! ,[Sandy is using SpongeBob as a basketball],
,SpongeBob:, I'm better, guys! Really! ,[both push SpongeBob until he squeezes through them into the air],
,Sandy:, Now look what you've done, Patrick!
,Patrick:, What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up.
,Sandy:, You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor!
,Patrick:, I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob? ,[SpongeBob comes down and rolls away],
,SpongeBob:, Guys!
,Sandy:, Huh?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I can't stop now! ,[screams while he rolls down a hill], Help me! ,[Mr. Krabs is cleaning some dimes],
,Mr. Krabs:, Shiny dimes.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob? ,[runs out the front doors], Stop! SpongeBob! Stop! ,[SpongeBob stops in front of restaurant. Mr. Krabs sighs in relief. Then SpongeBob screams as he sneezes so hard, the pink bubbles destroy the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is angry. Later at the hospital],
,Purple Doctorfish:, Well, Mr. SquarePants, it seems you have the suds. Are you ready for your treatment?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles and shakes his head], You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
,Purple Doctorfish:, No, silly, you get the sponge treatment. Oh, Hans? ,[a real hand comes through the door and takes SpongeBob out of the room. Shows the hand cleaning SpongeBob with soap],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! ,[Hans is using real SpongeBob to rub a man (played by Tom Kenny)'s back in the shower], This tickles! ,[Hans uses real SpongeBob to scrub a man's feet. SpongeBob sniffs], I can smell again! ,[real SpongeBob being used to wash a plate, a car and the floor], Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah! ,[SpongeBob being rinsed off in the sink and put back in the doctor's room. SpongeBob is a normal, yellow color], I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
,Hans:, Here is your lollipop. ,[hands SpongeBob a big lollipop. Sandy winks at SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, A lollipop? ,[takes a bubble wand and blows a bubble], Hey, doc, well I’ve got the suds, too.
,Purple Doctorfish:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, yes, Dr. Patrick, we have a special treatment for you.
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick gets taken away by Hans. He's being washed in the sink with soap], Hey! Hey, wait! ,[used on a cactus], Ouch! That hurts! ,[being used to scrub a toilet], Wait, this doesn't seem right!

It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing! ,[Runs over to dark alley],

,SpongeBob:, Plankton?
,Plankton:, No, please!  I told you I'd get the money! Please, I- ,[Stops suddenly and realizes SpongeBob is standing right behind him.] ,Oh, it's you.
,SpongeBob:, Plankton, what's got you so upset? I can hear you from three blocks away!
,Plankton:, Oh, that. It's this doomsday device I invented. ,[Holds up small device] ,It just doesn't do what it's supposed to do! 
,SpongeBob:, Doomsday device? What's it supposed to do?
,Plankton:, Well, it's supposed to upset the Earth's axis. Causing a chain reaction with typhoons, earthquakes, etc.
,SpongeBob:, So, what does it do instead?
,Plankton:, It just sparks and falls apart.
,SpongeBob:, Sparks and falls apart?
,Plankton:, You don't believe me?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Frantically], N-no!  I believe you! I uh... ,[Plankton presses button on his device, causing it to spark and smoke and eventually fall apart.], ...believe you.
,Plankton:, Oh, what's the use?!  Everyday the same old thing. Life is an endless succession of failures and disappointments.
,SpongeBob:, Well, look on the bright side, Plankton. If all your hopes and dreams finally came true, then you wouldn't have anything left to look forward to.
,Plankton:, Well, I didn't think I could feel any worse, but at least I know now that anything is possible.
,SpongeBob:, Plankton, wait! ,[Holds out arms to stop him],Wait! ,[Long pause],Wait!
,Plankton:, I'm waiting!
,SpongeBob:, Maybe what you need is to join a club or something. Meet new people. You know, make some friends.
,Plankton:, Hmmm. Yes. Yes. Are you suggesting I form an evil alliance?
,SpongeBob:, Um, something like that.
,Plankton:, That ,is, an ,excellent, idea! But where would someone like me find new friends?
,SpongeBob:, Well, usually when I'm trying to find something, I just look it up in the phone book. ,[Holds up yellow phone book. Then he gives it to Plankton],
,Plankton:, ,[Struggles with phone book in his hands], ,[Sarcastically], Oh, great. Thanks. ,[Throws book on the ground and climbs on it.] ,Let's see here. Aha!  Here we go. ,[Reads off of phone book], Evil villain for hire. Call Man Ray. No job too diabolical.
,SpongeBob:, Man Ray? But he's one of Bikini Bottom's most notorious super villains! Arch nemesis of fame television super heroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. ,[Gets confused], He's in the phone book? ,[Plankton laughs], Plankton, you were looking under ,Fiends, not ,Friends.,
,Plankton:, Oh, I know, SpongeBob. I know. ,[Tries to hold in his laughter, but he can't and starts laughing again. SpongeBob laughs with him. He then stops and gets confused. Bubble transition to Man Ray in the Bargain Mart putting stuff into vending machines.], Man Ray! We meet at long last! And who would have thought to find here you here, working a part-time job restocking vending machines? That's very clever, Man Ray. Very clever. And now let us join in evil alliance!
,Man Ray: ,Have we met? 
,Plankton:, ,[Chuckles], Don't you remember? We spoke on the phone. I, Plankton, know of a secret formula.  A formula that holds ,[whispers], The secret. The, oh, so precious secret of the Krusty Krab. And he who controls the Krusty Krab controls Bikini Bottom. Once that formula is in out possession, we- ,[Is interrupted by Man Ray picking up a box.],
,Man Ray,: Una! ,[Looks down at Plankton], I'm listening. 
,Plankton:, Then together we will steal the formula, crush Mr. Krabs and RULE THE WORLD! Mwa hahahaha! ,[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab while Mr. Krabs is whistling.],
,Mr. Krabs: ,[Notices a tape measure at his feet. It wiggles and slides away.] ,Huh? ,[Sees Plankton holding the tape measure] ,Plankton! 
,Plankton: ,Oh, don't mind me, Krabs. I'm just taking a few measurements. I want to make sure there's enough room to install a hot tub when I assume ownership of this dump. ,[Mr. Krabs takes him outside, about to fling him away.] ,But before you toss me out like yesterday's garbage, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Come on out, partner. 
,Mr. Krabs: ,Partner? That's the silliest thing you've ever- ,[Screams as his eyes bulge out. Man Ray runs toward him while flipping over a rock and hitting the ground in front of Mr. Krabs and Plankton.],
,Plankton,: I want you to say hello to my new partner and your new overlord, Man Ray. 
,Mr Krabs: ,[Nervously] ,Hello. ,[Runs away while screaming and dropping Plankton.] ,
,Man Ray: ,Hm, was it something I said? 
,Mr. Krabs: ,Hang on to your hats and glasses! Doom is upon us! ,[Runs around] , And it's dressed in a red leotard! 
,SpongeBob:, ,[Is holding onto a Krusty Krab cup], Mr. Krabs! You said to hold onto your glasses! When all I could find were these extra large milkshake cups!  Do these count?
,Mr. Krabs: ,Never mind that now! I want you to go up to the roof, and light the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light. 
,SpongeBob:, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light? What for?
,Mr. Krabs: , Because! We're having an emergency! ,[Shouts so loud that is shakes the whole Krust Krab.],
,SpongeBob:, Aye aye, captain! ,[Runs away leaving the cups floating in midair. Mr. Krabs looks at them suspiciously and they fall.],
,Plankton: ,It looks like Krabs isn't as foolish as I thought. He's boarded-up the front entrance. ,[He points to a boarded-up entrance to the Krusty Krab.] ,I think you know what we need to do now. 
,Man Ray: ,Right, of course. ,[Holds up laser gun and shoots the door.],
,Mr. Krabs: ,You can relax now, Squidward. They're not getting in- ,[boards start to dissolve behind him.] ,Never mind. 
,SpongeBob:, ,[Runs through door on the roof], Where is it? Where is it? That search light could be anywhere up here! Oop! There! ,[points to a huge light that you couldn't possibly miss. He presses an on button and the light turns on.], Yes! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will be here in no time! ,[Waits. Nothing happens.], Hmm.

Man-Ray-Krusty-Krab-taking-over! ,[Two workers look at each other and take SpongeBob out of the retirement home.],
,Worker #1:, Sorry, kid. This is a retirement community, not an insane asylum. ,[Both workers walk away. SpongeBob looks through an open window and sees a bunch of old people sitting in chairs. Finally, he sees Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Mermaid Man is snoring away while Barnacle Boy looks board. He sips his drink casually.SpongeBob gasps and tries knocking on the glass.],
,Mermaid Man:, ,[wakes up], Huh? Do you hear that? 
,Barnacle Boy:, Probably just the old air conditioner acting up.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[Stands up tiredly], I'll fix it! ,[Walks over to the window where SpongeBob is. SpongeBob waves at him, but Mermaid Man starts to punch the air conditioner.], You old piece of junk! ,[He keeps pounding it until it goes through the window and falls on SpongeBob.], Yep, that must've been it. It's not making that sound anymore. ,[Sits down on the couch again.],
,Plankton: ,Well, well, well, the Krusty Krab is finally ours! ,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward put their hands up.] ,Now we can take the secret formula and rule the world. Hand it over, Eugene. 
,Mr. Krabs: ,No way! You'll never know the secret of making Krabby Patties! 
,Man Ray: ,Wait a minute, I thought you said this was the secret formula for world domination. 
,Plankton: ,There's a direct correlation:  Domination in the fast food market place leads to total world control. Maybe you need to taste a Krabby Patty, then you'll understand. You there! Bring us a couple of Krabby Patties ASAP.
,Mr. Krabs: ,Squidward... Squidward! 
,Squidward: ,Huh? I don't get paid enough for this.
,[Back at Shady Shoals, an old lady is walking through the front door. This gives SpongeBob an idea],
,SpongeBob:, Hmm. ,[He sucks all the air out of himself which makes him look all dried up and old. He walks past the worker working at the front counter.], Good afternoon.
,Worker #1: ,Good afternoon, sir!
,[As SpongeBob walks down the hall, he pops back to normal and starts running. He runs right past a ""Lady's Choice"" dance. He walks back to the door to check it out. He walks through the dance and sees Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy at the snack table.],
,SpongeBob: ,Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! ,[a lady stops him],
,Elderly Lady: ,May I have this dance?
,SpongeBob: ,Of course. ,[Starts to dance with her, but he notices Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy leaving the snack table.] ,I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to excuse myself. I-uh...
,Old Lady: ,[Walks up to SpongeBob] ,Hi, handsome. Do you wanna dance? 
,SpongeBob: ,Certainly. ,[They dance.] ,
,Elderly Lady: ,Hands off, I saw him first! 
,Old Lady: ,That's what you think, sister. ,[All the ladies in the room start to come toward SpongeBob, fighting to get him.] ,
,Crowd: ,No, I saw him first! Nuh uh! He's mine!
,SpongeBob: ,Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy!
,Barnacle Boy: ,I never really liked these things, anyway. ,[He and Mermaid Man walk away from the snack table],
,SpongeBob:, Ahhh! Mermaid Man!
,[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab while the search light is still on.],
,Plankton: ,[Squidward brings Man Ray a tray of Krabby Patties.] ,Ah, here we go! 
,Squidward: ,Two Krabby Patties. Enjoy your meal. 
,Plankton: ,Oh, we will! We'll enjoy it a lot, slave. ,[Man Ray picks up his patty and eats it, and afterwards, he burps.] ,Well! Now that you've experienced a Krabby Patty firsthand, are you ready to assume control of the secret formula and take over the world? 
,Man Ray: ,Hmm... it certainly was tasty, but I think I need to try another one before I know for sure. ,[Picks up other patty.],
,Plankton: ,Hey! That one was mine! ,[Man Ray burps] ,Well, are you satisfied? Can we get on with our lives now? 
,Man Ray: ,Hmm... satisfied... not quite! I think this will require another helping of ""research"". Hey, you there! Another platter of your finest Krabby Patties, please.  ,[Plankton sighs],
,[Back at Shady Shoals, SpongeBob is running around the halls],
,SpongeBob:, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! Mermaid Man and- ,[slips on a wet floor], Whoa! ,[He slips to the end of the hallway, where he breaks through a door.],
,Barnacle Boy: ,What the?
,Mermaid Man: ,Is nap time over already?
,SpongeBob:, Come quick! The Krusty Krab is in dire straits! Plankton and Man Ray teamed up and blah blah blah blah blah blah!
,Mermaid Man: ,This must be one of the new guys.
,Barnacle Boy: ,No kidding, we'd like to help out, but we can't just yet.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Sternly], What do you mean you can't?
,Barnacle Boy: ,We just woke up from our nap. 
,Mermaid Man: ,And after naptime is when they usually serve ice cream!
,Barnacle Boy: ,So in the meantime, uh, you're gonna have to be your own hero.
,Mermaid Man: ,Unless you wanna wait for ice cream too? ,[SpongeBob stands there, awkwardly.],
,[Back at the Krusty Krab, Squidward is making Krabby Patties. SpongeBob barges through the kitchen door, panting.],
,Squidward: ,SpongeBob, where have you been? I've been covering for you on the grill for the past 3 hours! My arm feels like it's gonna snap in half!
,Man Ray: ,[Is still eating Krabby Patties.] ,
,Squidward: ,It's that guy in red. He's a really high maintenance customer.
,Plankton: ,Can we please steal the secret formula now? Pretty please, Man Ray?
,Man Ray: ,I must have more! ,[Starts to pound on the table] ,Bring me more Krabby Patties! Bring more Krabby Patties!  ,[Shoots roof with laser gun] ,

Squidward will die of embarrassment if they hear his dilemma! Poor Squidward, he must be in too much pain to make courtesy noises. ,[breathes in then puffs out his chest], I'll cover for him!

,SpongeBob:, You mean that wasn't gastrointestinal distress?
,Squidward:, And you guys! ,[referring to the workers], Do you really think that billboard is more important than my musical genius?
,Worker 1:, Well, sorry, but some of us rather enjoy the Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra.
,Squidward:, ,[in awe], Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra?
,Worker 1:, And we find their public announcements to be quite interesting.
,[other worker puts up a part that says ""Original Compositions Wanted""],
,Squidward:, Original compositions wanted? Me, a famous composer? ,[Squidward imagines himself riding in a limo], Thank you! ,[he then walks out of the limbo and walks down a red carpet, he then imagines himself conducting, then it goes back to Squidward, he melts from the thought of it], That would be nice. ,[runs outside and kisses the worker],

,Patrick:, Yeah! ,[grunts as he sticks the bones back up his butt, making an awful crunching noise, and appear in his mouth], Ah. Much better.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, I think you should see a doctor.
,Patrick:, I can't see a doctor. My job doesn't provide me with health insurance.

Oh, why? ,[Patrick is hitting his knee with a hammer, and SpongeBob is timing how long it takes until he screams, he then writes something down on his clipboard, Squidward goes back to writing], Dowrgghgh! ,[he groans, and is interrupted when SpongeBob his looking at Patrick's mouth, then by an x-ray, then by some squeaking, he then struggles to write, but keeps getting interrupted by screaming, hours pass by and then Squidward is finally finished.

,Johnny:, Good evening, music lovers of Bikini Bottom. Tonight, is the premiere of a new symphony, written by one of our own, Squidward Tentacles. ,[Squidward walks up on stage and starts conducting his composition, everything is fine until he hears Patrick laughing, having fun, listening to a rubber duck squeak, yelling],
,Squidward:, I wrote down everything I heard? ,[gulps and looks at the audience, SpongeBob drops a brick on Patrick's leg, then an anchor],
,Pilar:, Oooo! That's gonna leave a mark! ,[Squidward sweats in embarrassment],
,[SpongeBob puts on a rubber glove then squeaks a rubber duck near Patrick, then uses the x-ray, then the laugh machine, then reading magazines, then SpongeBob plays with his brain, then he's reading magazines again, then using the x-ray again, then the laugh machine, then the duck, then the magazine, then playing with the brain. This process repeats twice, second time shorter time. then using the blood pressure pump to pump up Patrick, he loses control of the air in his body and starts flying around like a balloon, smacking into Squidward as the song ends],
,Nazz:, Poor little guy. ,[as Patrick sits up straight on Squidward, the song comes to an end],
,Squidward:, Patrick, get off of me! ,[Patrick does so, Squidward growls at him, then looks at the audience, Squidward begins to sadly walk off the stage, but then everyone begins cheering],

,Bill:, Let us not forget the chubby starfish!
,Fred:, Oh yeah, but the real genius is the composer! ,[all chanting], Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!

,[SpongeBob grabs some nails, sticks them on a board and nails it down on some wood. He uses his tongue as a measuring stick to measure another board.

,SpongeBob:, Perfect! Just like my old kitchen. ,[pushes his nose which opens his pants; he takes out his spatula and throws several patties on the grill], I'm ready! ,[dings a wooden ring-bell and brings in a plate of Krabby Patties with three napkins beside], Squidward, order's up!

,Frankie Billy:, ,[chews on his patty], Huh? ,[spits it out], These are cold! I paid for a hot meal.
,Customers:, Yeah! ,[shouts],
,Frankie Billy:, Maybe if we go up there, we can get 'em fresh!
,Norma Rechid:, To the roof!
,Customers:, Yeah! ,[climb up the ladder and reach the rooftop],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! I better make more room up here.
,[The scene changes to the rooftop made into the replica of the main Krusty Krab dining room.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, boy-o, at first I just thought you were being a lily-livered, spineless, crybaby, scardey-pants, invertebrate loser. ,[SpongeBob groans dejectedly as he felt offended by Mr. Krabs' words], But this rooftop restaurant of yours really has me business booming! ,[kisses the money],
,SpongeBob:, Wish you could've talked Squidward into joining us up here.
,[Meanwhile, at the ground floor of the Krusty Krab, Squidward decorated the entire dining room with his art. He even renovated his counter into a bed.],
,Squidward:, Finally, this place has some class. I might actually enjoy working here now. ,[jumps on his bed and goes to sleep],
,[Meanwhile, on the roof of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are continuing filling out orders for the customers.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ten more patties, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, You got it, Mr. K.
,[Suddenly, the sky turns dark as rainclouds block out the sun. SpongeBob flips the patties and wind starts blowing.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw... ,[screams as the patties are getting blown away],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gets hit by the incoming patties], No, no—me money! ,[chases his money, but crashes into the customers and gets blown away by the wind],
,Customer:, ,[gets blown by the wind], Hey, I just realized being outside is awful!
,[Patrick still remains on his chair, and eats all of the flying Krabby Patties. Soon, the weather starts to rain and thunder.],
,Fred:, Rain? But we're under—,[gets blown away by the wind],
,[The customers prepare to climb back down and take shelter from the storm.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait, wait, don't go! ,[chuckles nervously], A little wind never hurt anyone!
,Patrick:, Whoa, whoa! ,[gets hit in the face with an incoming patty, falls off the roof and crashes to the ground], Ow!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[clings onto the roof], SpongeBob, we're losing 'em. Do something!
,SpongeBob:, Aye-aye, sir!
,[As quick as a flash, SpongeBob builds the entire Krusty Krab on top of the original Krusty Krab roof. Everyone inside, including Mr. Krabs, is amazed now that they are safe from the storm.],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's beautiful, boy-o!
,Henry-Bart:, Yeah, it's pretty nice, but now that we're not outside, I'm starting to get bored.
,Customers:, Yeah, so... ,[chatter as they head out the door],
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops them], Wait! You can't be bored when there's dancing! ,[stuffs a radio inside his head, puts a tape cassette in his mouth and starts playing music; then he starts to dance], Whoo! ,[giggles as he shows off his dance moves],
,[As SpongeBob shows off his dance moves, the customers and Mr. Krabs starts to feel the rhythm and joins in the dance.],
,Customers:, He's right!
,[The customers stomp their feet to the music. Outside, the rain starts wearing out the mud, and so the Krusty Krab begins to sink in. Meanwhile, Squidward is still sleeping, oblivious to the fact that the Krusty Krab is sinking in. Everyone upstairs still continues to dance as the original Krusty Krab sinks into the mud. Suddenly, the rain stopped and out comes a rainbow. Everyone comes outside happy.],
,SpongeBob:, Hooray! We're not on the roof anymore!
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, after all that dancing and partying today, tomorrow's gonna feel like starting a new business!
,SpongeBob:, And I'm looking forward to getting in on the ground floor with you!
,[Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and the customers laugh. Meanwhile, underground, Squidward wakes up from his nap and looks at his watch.],
,Squidward:, Time to go home already? ,[jumps off his bed and heads to the door, but bumps into dirt], Ow. ,[screams as dirt floods the entire bottom floor of the original Krusty Krab],
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[at the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, ,[humming to the radio. Opens the door for a customer who is leaving], Oh, thank you for eating at The Krusty Krab. ,[SpongeBob is trying to balance stacks of trays with food on them], Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Sure. Thanks, Squidward! Gee, looks like playing Kelpy G's music here in the restaurant has really energized him.
,SpongeBob:, Wow. Kelpy's music is really, um, unique.
,Squidward:, Kelpy's not for everyone.
,D.J.:, That was Kelpy G. Taking you on a trip that is out of this ocean. Hope you fellow Kelpheads got your tickets early 'cause his concert tonight at High Tide Stadium is, sorry, sold out.
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Kelpy G is performing tonight, Squidward. But tickets are… ,[in announcer's voice], sorry, sold out.
,Squidward:, Oh, how could this be? Whatever shall I do?
,SpongeBob:, You forgot to buy a ticket?
,Squidward:, Oh no, I have a ticket. I just don't know what I'll do without you there. ,[snaps], Oh wait, I just realized... I'll be having the greatest time of my life!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, may I at least gaze upon your ticket?
,Squidward:, Oh yeah. I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it! ,[Patrick swallows ticket],
,SpongeBob:, You're probably not gonna get that back before show time.
,D.J.:, This goes out to all those sad sacks without a ticket to tonight’s concert. We're giving away the last two tickets to one lucky caller.
,Squidward:, Oh, the dream is still alive! ,[Squidward rushes over to the phone and dials],
,D.J.:, Hey, you are lucky loser number one. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number five. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number nine. Please, try again. Twenty-two. Try again. Twenty-seven. Sixty-five.
,Squidward:, Oh, come on! Nothing but a scam.
,D.J.:, Hello! You're winning caller number 102.
,SpongeBob:, I am? ,[Squidward falls over sideways],
,D.J.:, Not only have you won two front row seats, but you and a friend will go backstage to meet Kelpy G himself.
,SpongeBob:, Me and a friend. Hmm, I wonder who that will be.
,[cut to later that night],
,SpongeBob:, Can you believe it? We're gonna meet your hero, Kelpy G! ,[shows backstage pass],
,Squidward:, Ah, so nice to be surrounded by such kindred spirits.
,Female Fan #1:, You can say that again. It's a rare treat to mingle with true diehard smooth jazzists.
,SpongeBob:, You said it, lady. I've been a diehard since 10:00 this morning. Who's ready for a Kelpy G concert tonight?!
,Male Fan #1:, Was it you who brought the raucous miscreant?
,Squidward:, Me? No. Of course not. No.
,Squidward:, See all you fellow Kelpheads at the show.
,Female Fan #1:, Just keep your friends outbursts under control.
,SpongeBob:, Isn't this so much fun, Squidward? Wow, I love your Kelpy G wig, sir.
,Male Fan #2:, What wig?
,Squidward:, Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob's obnoxiousness is ostracizing me from all these other fans. Somehow I gotta give him to slip.
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, just look at that lemonade line.
,Squidward:, That's it. Hang on, SpongeBob. I need a rest. My throat is parched. I sure wish I knew where one could procure some lemonade.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Squidward:, I said, I wonder where someone could get some lemonade.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Squidward:, It's right behind you SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Why don't I get one for you?
,Squidward:, Oh, no. Dear me. Oh, no. I could not have you wait in that long line, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, It's no problem, Squidward, really, I—
,Squidward:, Well, okay, if you insist.
,SpongeBob:, Alright. One lemonade, coming up.
,Squidward:, ,[chuckles], See you after the show, Spongee-G.
,Squidward:, ,[a few Squids are snapping at some jazz music], Ah, ""Turquoise Scallop Sun Dance."" I just love this tune.
,Male Fan #3:, Hey hey, a fellow mellow jazz-dazzler. What's happening?
,Squidward:, Just grooving to the soothing waves of the Gentle G.
,Male Fan #3:, I'm picking up what you're laying down. You can groove with us any time.
,Squidward:, Don't mind if I do groove.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughing], Look what I found!
,Squidward:, What the…? What?
,SpongeBob:, Guess what? There's a second lemonade stand! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, nice tune. ,[gets out ukulele], Nothing like a little accompaniment meant to bring out the genius of Kelpy's kazoo playing, huh, guys?
,Male Fan #3:, Kazoo? Your friend knows absolutely nothing of Kelpy G, man!
,SpongeBob:, Are you friends with Squidward?
,Male Fan #3:, Friends? I should think not. We only associate with true jazz-dazzlers.
,Squidward:, But I dazzle. Oh.
,[cut to later at concert. Squidward and SpongeBob sit in front row],
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! Kelpy, yeah! Put your hands together, people.
,Squidward:, Oh, boy.
,Female Fan #2:, Hey, Sponge! Would you just sit down and shut your mouth?
,Male Fan #4:, Well, thank you for speaking up. ,[indistinct chatter from everyone else],
,Announcer:, Hello, all you snazzy jazzlers. Please put your thumbs and forefingers together and give a warm welcome to the pied piper of jazz himself— Kelpy G. ,[he comes out and plays some jazz on his clarinet],
,Male Fan #5:, Bravo! Bravo! It's so exciting!
,SpongeBob:, Wow!
,Squidward:, Such immaculate music. It's the very voice of Neptune himself.
,Patrick:, ,[pokes Squidward's head], Excuse me, sir, do you have any ketchup?
,Squidward:, No I don't — ketchup?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what brought you here?
,Patrick:, Two words, SpongeBob— ""na"" ""chos.""
,Squidward:, Two words, Patrick— ""get lost.""
,Patrick:, ,[points to Squidward's backstage pass], What's that?
,Squidward:, Oh, no, you don't, Patrick. You stay away from my backstage pa— huh? ,[Patrick is swallowing the backstage pass. Squidward deflates],
,SpongeBob:, It's okay, Squidward, you're the biggest Kelpy G fan I know. Please, take my backstage pa— ,[Patrick takes it and swallows it. He burps and his stomach growls],
,Patrick:, Tummy want more. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, boy.
,Squidward:, ,[gets extremely angry], I'm going to get those passes back even if I have to rip Patrick in half. ,[rips his head in half], What the...?
,Patrick:, ,[goes up on stage and takes the microphone], I would like two extra cheesy nachos with a side of cheese and two vanilla coral shakes. ,[crowd booing], Actually, make that two cheese coral shakes. And instead of whipped cream on top, I'll take cream cheese on the bottom. That's it for now. ,[two stage security fish get on either side of Patrick],
,Security Fish #1:, Get 'im! ,[they both jump into each other as Patrick jumps off the stage and crowd surfs],
,Male Fan #6:, You're so light.
,Squidward:, Hey, come back here with those backstage passes.
,Crew Member:, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where do you think you're going?
,Squidward:, But our friend just took our—
,Crew Member:, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't care about the whosits or the whatsits. Clear the aisle and go back to your seat. ,[they do so],
,Squidward:, Oh, well, at least we still have our seats. ,[a giant squid is sitting in both seats. Squidward gets angry],
,Big Squid:, You got a problem, tentacle head?
,Squidward:, Yeah, I got a problem. Those are my seats, you numbskull. I'm gonna rant for a while. You're just gonna sit there, aren't ya? ,[Kelpy G stops his jazz], You're not gonna move along. We waited long and hard for this— ,[security grabs Squidward and toss both him and SpongeBob out of the concert. Squidward sobs], Tonight's ruined. A complete disaster. And I didn't even meet Kelpy G.
,Patrick:, Keep it jazzy, Miles. And thanks for the grub. ,[Squidward and SpongeBob run inside the backstage door],
,Squidward:, We're in, SpongeBob. Now I'll finally get to meet the incomparable Kelpy G. ,[runs into the manager],
,Milo J. Fingerfish:, Hey, this is a private area. Only people with backstage passes can come back here.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, well, you see, sir, we had backstage passes. But my friend ate them with his nachos, then he dove off the stage and got carried away by the audience.
,Milo J. Fingerfish:, What are you talking about? I'm Kelpy G's manager. Now read my lips. ,[Squidward literally does so],
,Squidward:, ""No backstage passes, no entry.""
,Milo J. Fingerfish:, And no seeing Kelpy G, got it?
,Squidward:, Oh, please, please, let me see him. Please. Please. Please!
,Milo J Fingerfish:, Get up, man. Have some dignity.
,Squidward:, But, but, but… what if I told you, uh… I'm a clarinet player myself. ,[manager groans], I call this one, ""Ninth Movement, A Kaleidoscope of Stars."" Wait. Hold for it. ,[inhales and plays off-key],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Oh! ,[gets out his ukulele and plays. Squidward plays his clarinet in SpongeBob's face. The manager groans again. Back at the stage, Kelpy G gets finished],
,Crew Member:, Right this way, Mr. G.
,Kelpy G:, Another show, another intermission.
,Crew Member:, Your dressing room is right over here, sir.
,Kelpy G:, Hold on a smooth second.
,Crew Member:, Who let those two back here? That sounds horrible. I'll get 'im right out.
,Kelpy G:, No, no. I agree. The clarinet sound abysmal, but that ukulele. Genius. And his clogs. They're just like mine, see? Excuse me, young man.
,Squidward:, Hello, Kelpy. It's great to finally meet— ,[Kelpy pushes him away],
,Kelpy G:, And what might you be called?
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBob SquarePants.
,Kelpy G:, Come, young protege, let us woo the crowd with sounds of heavenly delight. ,[crowd is softly chanting ""Kelpy""], At this time, I'd like to welcome a very special guest to the stage — Mr. SpongeBob SmoothPants. ,[SpongeBob and Kelpy play their instruments at the same time and the crowd loves it],
,Squidward:, This isn't fair. I should be on stage, not SpongeBob. I'm the mega-talent. I'll show you, Kelpy. ,[security takes Squidward away], But I'm a musician!

"Squidward:, Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you. ,[flashback to him dancing with some other fish], All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple. ,[flashback to him getting his legs twisted and stretched], Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing. ,[pulls some hair off his leg as a scream is heard], And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...! ,[runs out of his house and into a bar of bamboo],
,Patrick:, Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.
,Squidward:, What? What are you two doing?
,SpongeBob:, We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
,Patrick:, We're gonna win the trophy.
,Squidward:, Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going. ,[shows them the trophy case],
,SpongeBob:, You built us a trophy case for when we win? ,[both hug Squidward], Oh, you are a true friend.
,Squidward:, no, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye. ,[runs out but runs into the limbo bar again],
,Patrick:, Ruling, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I think we better raise the bar. ,[cut to the tryouts where Squidward sits down on the bench],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Hiya, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward.
,Female:, ,[over loudspeaker], Contestants 51 and 52 to the stage, please.

,Judge:, You're done. You know, next contestant. You didn't make the cut, sorry, Mac.
,Squidward:, But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it...
,Judge:, Hey!
,Squidward:, But I, hey... Unhand me, you brutes. Ah! ,[cut to Squidward crying into his house and walking into a limbo bar again],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Doh, help me up.
,SpongeBob:, How'd the audition go, Squidward?
,Squidward:, (gets choked up)The audition? My trophy? ,[sobs uncontrollably], I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition. ,[chuckles], Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life.
,Patrick:, Whoa.
,SpongeBob:, Impressive. ,[gasps], Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?
,Squidward:, What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes.
,Patrick:, Like polishing your empty trophy case?
,Squidward:, Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Deal.
,Squidward:, Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Ok, here I go. Watch me now. ,[goes under the limbo stick but gets a butt cramp before going all the way through], Cramp! ,[screams and rolls around. Squidward opens the door and Patrick rolls outside],
,Squidward:, Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and... ,[turns on some music. SpongeBob laughs and wiggles his arms and legs all around the room. Squidward grabs his arms], Having fun?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, yes I am.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and...plié. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward bend their knees], Relevé. ,[twirl around on their toes], And now grand jeté. ,[Squidward slips on the limbo stick], Where am I? See if I can find the lights. ,[turns on the light and sees a giant SpongeBob face. Squidward's head is stuck inside SpongeBob's body], Wait a minute. ,[feels around], This gives me an idea. ,[Squidward's body is now inside SpongeBob's], Ready, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[salutes], Ready!
,Squidward:, A one and a two, and... ,[SpongeBob dances], Plié, jeté, relevé - ,[SpongeBob's legs get tangled in a knot], No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet.
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes off feet], How'd you know? ,[he wiggles both of his left pair of toes],
,Squidward:, Gimme those. ,[takes SpongeBob's legs and puts his own legs through SpongeBob's pants], That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing? ,[SpongeBob's arms are in the air wiggling], Why are you moving your arms like that?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], I guess they're happy.
,Squidward:, Argh, hand 'em over. ,[SpongeBob hands Squidward one of his arms], And the other one, come on. ,[Squidward breaks off the other one then uses his arms as SpongeBob's], Ah, now that's more like it.
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.
,Squidward:, Are you questioning my leadership.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I just...
,Squidward:, Ok, hand it over. ,[SpongeBob hands his mouth to Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, You know what, Squidward?
,Squidward:, What's that?
,SpongeBob:, I think I'm suffering for my art now. ,[cut to the dance recital where Pilar is already dancing], Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
,Squidward:, Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves.
,[Pilar who is dancing falls on his face. The crowd gasps as the judges give him a total score of 5. The next dancer is a whale balancing a ball on its head. The judges total score is 23.5. The next dancer is a giant sea horse, then a dancer who can balance coins on his arms while jumping up and down. The judges score him a 29.5],
,SpongeBob:, Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent.
,Squidward:, Quit groveling. Where is your dignity? ,[gets SpongeBob up and slaps him], These losers are here to worship us. I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more.

,Squidward:, Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking. ,[dances],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent.
,Squidward:, Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste.

,Nat:, Is he hurt?
,Nathiel:, I don't know man, but it's hurting my eyes.
,Clay:, I think I'm gonna be sick. ,[throws up],

"Squidward:, ,[Wakes up, jumps into the shower, and starts to brush himself when he starts hearing a slide whistling noise every time he moves the brush], Huh? What's that? Hmm, must be hearing things.
,[Goes outside and breathes in],
,Squidward:, Ahhhh... smell that fresh morning sea! ,[Singing to himself], ♪La da dum dum dee.♪
,[Bends down to pick up the newspaper and hears the slide whistling noise. The same happens when he stands back up],
,Squidward:, Huh? Must be hearing things... Again!
,[Slide whistling noises happen when he shakes the bag and when the newspaper slides out],
,Squidward:, ,[Breathes out. hears the slide whistle], What is that noise?!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing],
,Squidward:, Ahhhh.... I should have guessed. It's too early for this.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing again],
,Squidward:, Alright, you two! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are seen as lumps under Squidward's front mat. He stomps on the lumps], What is the meaning of this?!
,[Squidward lifts up the mat],
,SpongeBob:, What is the meaning of this?! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. They stand up with the slide whistle effect], We're slide whistling!
,Squidward:, Don't you mean, ""Playing the slide whistle?""
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, slide whistling is more than just simply tooting on an instrument! It's a way of life! Let's show him Patrick.
,[Squidward's door opens with the slide whistling effect. SpongeBob and Patrick run inside],
,Squidward:, Hey! Get out of here! Huh? ,[Squidward looks around and doesn't see them. SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing],

,Squidward:, I don't need zest! I need you out of my lampshade! ,[Squidward jumps onto the table to get them out but they're not there. SpongeBob appears with the slide whistle effect behind a plant],
,Squidward:, Get out of there!
,[SpongeBob floats through the air with the slide whistle noise and out the door],
,Squidward:, Grrrrr... ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are spinning around the circular windows], Just get out of there! ,[They land onto Squidward's paintings. as the shape of Squidward's head], Okay, that's enough! You've had your fun.
,SpongeBob:, True, Squidward, true. We have had our fun. But you know what's twice as much fun?! ,[Pops out of the painting], Twice as many slide whistles! After you, my good man. ,[hands Patrick a slide whistle],
,Patrick:, Thanks, buddy! ,[Patrick floats out of the painting and across the room. SpongeBob follows. They start to head toward the windows],
,Squidward:, Not the windows again! ,[Runs to the window and opens it], Gotcha! They're gone. Whew! Now if they'd just stay out of my house, I might be able to enjoy a little squid time.
,[Squidward makes himself a pot of tea.. The slide whistle effect happens when he pours the tea into the cup.. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.

,Nancy:, Oh honey, I'm so sorry. I promise it'll never happen again. ,[Nancy and Frank hug.. Squidward plays the slide whistle.. Frank gets up. Lenny walks along],
,Lenny:, Can I help you... ,[Frank punches Lenny in the face],
,Frank:, Liar!
,Frank (red shirt):, She's not lying. ,[angry mob appears with torches and pitchforks], She speaks the truth. Someone wicked has disturbed our peaceful city, Frank. ,[captions version Man: She's not lying, she speaks the truth, someone wicked has disturbed our peaceful city, Frank],
,Frank:, But who would do such a thing?

,Frank (red shirt):, Yes, we must capture him. He must pay for his wrong doings!

,Patrick:, He's only a block away. ,[crowd yelling. Policemen see the angry mob],
,Police officer:, What do you make of it, Sarg?
,Sergeant:, It looks like a full scale riot. I'm calling for backup. ,[On his radio], Get me the K-9 unit!

,Squidward:, Now you're in the driver's seat Squiddy! ,[Squidward does the slide whistle noises and isn't paying attention to the road at all. All the fishes scream as he accelerates and drives through The Chum Bucket],

,Purple Doctorfish:, Your friend is very lucky. If it wasn't for that slide whistle getting lodged in his throat, the rescue team might have never found him. ,[The slide whistle starts going crazy in Squidward’s throat], His yelling, or whistling I should say, under all that rubble saved his life.
,SpongeBob:, Doctor, why did you leave the whistle in his throat?
,Purple Doctorfish:, Unfortunately, we don't have the technology to remove it yet. But on the bright side, he can still communicate with us.
,[The slide whistle starts going crazy again. Squidward is actually moving the slide whistle in a fit of anger, attempting to scream at SpongeBob and Patrick],

"SpongeBob:, Ah, time for bed, Gary. ,[takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes],
,Gary:, Meow?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary. ,[pulls socks off Gary's eyes], You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. ,[snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock], Hey! Over here! ,[laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out], Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! ,[driver's license appears], Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! ,[Car starts to move crazily], I sure take a good picture. ,[drives through a sign that says ""Road Ends""], Darn! I should have grown a mustache. ,[the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license], How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. ,[flies over the Krusty Krab], Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. ,[Mrs. Puff floats up to him], Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!

,Gary:, Meow. ,[snoring], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up to Gary's dream cloud], This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. ,[jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library], Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. ,[walks past a pile of books], Gary! Huh? ,[sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him], Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? ,[Gary turns around],
,Gary:, ,[gasps], SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Gary?
,Gary:, How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
,SpongeBob:, Gary! You can talk!
,Gary:, ,[sighs], In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
,SpongeBob:, What does that mean?
,Gary:, Come. ,[they walk down an aisle of books], For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. ,[picks up a book and reads from it], ""Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again."" Emily Dickinson wrote that.
,SpongeBob:, Who?
,Gary:, ,[flips a few pages], Here's one you might know. ,[clears throat], There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
,Gary:, Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
,SpongeBob:, Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. ,[starts walking away],
,Gary:, Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window], I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. ,[Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over], I can't resist! ,[laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery], Hey, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks over], You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
,Patrick:, Yup.
,SpongeBob:, I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. ,[transforms into the shape of a skyscraper], Going up! Eh? ,[sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again], I can make... ,[changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself], A million of me! Eh? Eh?
,Patrick:, Yup. ,[the clones disappear], 
,SpongeBob:, Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. ,[leaves],
,Patrick:, Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. ,[kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away], Oh! ,[the quarter falls into a grate], Shoot, that was my last quarter. ,[sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, this is gonna be good! ,[inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head], Psst! Squidward! ,[waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing], Hey, Squidward!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob!
,King:, Ahem! ,[sitting in the balcony above the stage], Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
,Squidward:, Yes, Your Highness. ,[Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up], SpongeBob!
,King:, Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! ,[giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow], Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
,Squidward:, ,[growling, pressing down on his clarinet], Sponge- ,[accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps], Bob...
,King:, ,[angry], I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
,Squidward:, ,[laughs nervously],
,SpongeBob:, ,[as a clarinet], Squidward! ,[points to himself and winks], Huh? Huh?
,Squidward:, ,[throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned], No way.
,King:, Ahem! ,[glares down at Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs and picks SpongeBob up], Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
,SpongeBob:, Trust me, Squidward. ,[Squidward blows into him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[off-key], La la! La la la la la la la! ,[The audience gasps again],
,Squidward:, ,[stops playing], SpongeBob!
,King:, ,[crying], Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
,[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[continues singing off-key],
,Fish:, ,[crying], His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
,[crowd cheers],
,Squidward:, ,[bowing], Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! ,[the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob],
,Fish:, What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess], So long, Squidward! ,[Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.],
,Squidward:, ,[starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain],
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome], Hey! I'm at Sandy's! ,[Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door], Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... ,[falls out of the plane and screams],
,Sandy:, ,[surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob], Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
,Sandy:, ,[turns upside down], Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. ,[a target is shown on the ground and SpongeBob and Sandy spins around],
,SpongeBob:, This seems kind of dangerous!
,Sandy:, Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
,SpongeBob:, Okay! ,[gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate],
,Sandy:, Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! ,[turns upside-down again],
,SpongeBob:, Gotcha! ,[lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger],
,Sandy:, Not a parakeet! Para- ,[Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time], medic...
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground], Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. ,[sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house], H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. ,[climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations,other girly features and boyfriend portraits.], Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
,Pearl:, Hello, SpongeBob! ,[sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup],
,SpongeBob:, ,[waves], Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
,Pearl:, You're just in time for the tea party!
,SpongeBob:, Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
,Pearl:, ,[Frowns], Oh. He's next door. ,[Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment], Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
,SpongeBob:, Bye! ,[gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen], I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. ,[peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat],
,Krabs:, I've got you now, you slippery demon! ,[inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod], You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. ,[SpongeBob hops into the boat],
,SpongeBob:, Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
,Krabs:, I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
,SpongeBob:, What are you talking about?
,Krabs:, I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. ,[Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook], It's the mighty Moby Dollar! ,[Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.], Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! ,[Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies], There she blows!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
,Krabs:, Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs a small jellyfishing net], This one?
,Krabs:, No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
,SpongeBob:, ,[reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it], Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
,Krabs:, Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens up the wallet], Net ready, sir!
,Krabs:, ,[pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet], I did it! ,[gets excited], I finally did it!
,SpongeBob:, Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. ,[puts down the wallet and wants to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but when he tries the wallet bounces toward the back of the boat; the wallet bounces away],
,Krabs:, No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,Krabs:, Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! ,[SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! Hey! I...!
,Krabs:, No! ,[dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean],
,SpongeBob:, This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
,Krabs:, Oh, SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mr. Krabs?
,Krabs:, ,[ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun], You're fired! ,[Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.], Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
,Plankton:, Zap! ,[zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out], I see you. ,[stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self], Zap! ,[shoots a green laser out of his eye],
,Fred:, My leg!
,Plankton:, I see you. Zap!
,SpongeBob:, Plankton! ,[tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle],
,Plankton:, I see you... ,[SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground], Zap! ,[zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic], Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. ,[stomps on it], Crush! ,[picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off], Lick, lick!
,SpongeBob:, This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
,Gary:, Meow! Meow!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.], Gary! Gary! No!
,Gary:, Meow! ,[Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds],
,Plankton:, Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
,SpongeBob:, Gary! ,[jumps over to Gary and hugs him], I've got you, Gary!
,Plankton:, Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! ,[steps on SpongeBob and Gary], Yeah! Huh? ,[lifts his foot from pain], Yow!
,SpongeBob:, ,[looking like a thumbtack], I think he's got the point. ,[laughs],
,Plankton:, ,[Starts shrinking.], Waaaaaah! ,[as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad], Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? ,[Burned Fred lifts his foot about to step on Plankton], No! No! No! Not the face! ,[gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall],
,SpongeBob:, ,[comes out and plops on the ground], Ooh! ,[SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping], Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. ,[goes to sleep], Ah... ,[wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head],
,Squidward:, ,[Head of Squidward starts surrounding SpongeBob], SpongeBob! ,[The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob],

,SpongeBob:, Two in one quarter? That's not fair. ,[puts in one of the prizes], What's that, ,clown frown,? Oh, you'd rather sit next to ,lovely lion,? ,[takes the crane and moves the prizes around], There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward.
,Squidward:, ,[scoots his way into his house and then sits on his couch and sighs], A little mind-numbing television ought to help me forget about that stupid machine. ,[tries to pick up the remote but every time he tries, he fails because of the crane coming into his mind. He then uses his eye instead to press a button on the remote], Yeeowwww! ,[he slides off the couch. Now he's in bed], You've had a rough day, Squiddie. But that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better. ,[tries to pull his covers but he can't because of the crane coming into his mind], Oooh, phooey!! ,[he shivers for a few seconds, gets up and then tries to pick up the glass of water by his bed but drops it and breaks it], I gotta win that crane! ,[he runs through his closet door and gets the piggy bank, which cries a teardrop. He then runs to the Krusty Krab. Later, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab and freaks out at what he sees when he enters], Just once! Please, oh, please, let me win one time!
,SpongeBob:, Squid, I think you have a problem.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, he doesn't. You don't listen to him, Squidward. You keep playing until you win! ,[takes out all the quarters that were put in the machine and pours them into a bucket. A piece of rolled paper drops into the bucket], What's this?
,Squidward:, The deed to my house.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okey-dokey, then. Carry on.
,Squidward:, ,[bawling], If I can just win once, I'd never play again! ,[wailing],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine?
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], SpongeBob, there's a secret?
,SpongeBob:, Mm-hmm.
,Squidward:, Tell me... ,[as his eyes get bigger], the... secret.
,SpongeBob:, Are you ready to be a winner?

,Squidward:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, Yes?
,Squidward:, Yes!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah?
,Squidward:, Yeah!

,Squidward:, SpongeBob! The secret?!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward, okay. I face the crane. Deposit my ,quarter,. Then I close my eyes.
,Squidward:, Close your eyes?
,SpongeBob:, Quiet, Squidward. I'm being the crane.
,Squidward:, Oh, that's ludi...
,Skill Crane:, Winner!
,SpongeBob:, See? Now you try.
,Squidward:, This is ridiculous. If I close my eyes, how will I know where the...
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, do you wanna win or not? 
,Squidward:, ,[presses face against machine], Yes! Yes, I do!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Squidward, put your quarter in.
,Squidward:, But this is my last quarter.
,SpongeBob:, In the machine, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Okay, okay. ,[he puts the quarter in the machine],
,SpongeBob:, Close your eyes. ,[Squidward does], Now be the crane. ,[while SpongeBob is telling him this, Squidward is playing the game], Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane.
,Skill Crane:, Winner!
,Squidward:, Whoo-hoo! Yeah! I knew I could do it! ,[laughs], I'm a winner!
,SpongeBob:, You're a winner!
,Squidward:, I am a winner, aren't I? ,[jumps up and down], Winner, winner, winner! ,[twirls], Wiiiiiinner! ,[over loudspeaker], I'm a winner, everybody! You hear that?! ,[cricket chirps in the empty restaurant. Squidward goes into Mr. Krabs' office, holds the teddy bear], I'm... a winner.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's funny. Last time I checked, you were a cashier.
,Squidward:, Yuck it up all you want, Mr. Krabs. But just remember, you're yucking in the presence... of a winner! ,[shoves the bear in his face], Ha! ,[runs out the door],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll try to remember that. ,[as he counts all of Squidward's quarters], 3,498 of Squidward's quarters... 3,499 of Squidward's quarters.
,SpongeBob:, Triple decker, on deck.
,Squidward:, ,[slams door in SpongeBob's face], Make way for the winner! ,[door opens to SpongeBob having the triple decker hanging out of his mouth like an accordion],
,Skill Crane:, You lose! ,[Billy sighs],
,Squidward:, You didn't win the prize?
,Billy:, No.
,Squidward:, You know what that means?
,Billy:, No, what?
,Squidward:, It means... you have no skills and you're a loser! ,[laughs], I'm a winner, see my prize! You're a loser who sits and cries! ,[he laughs, then Billy kicks him in the shin], Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! ,[later, Squidward and SpongeBob are walking out of the Krusty Krab], Did you see how I handled that crane?
,SpongeBob:, I sure did.
,Squidward:, I think I had the magic touch.
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,Squidward:, I just closed my eyes and became the crane.
,SpongeBob:, ,[getting exasperated], Oh, yeah, you're the man.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, look. ,[a real crane is just a few yards away. Squidward runs to it],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Squidward, I don't think the same principles apply.
,Squidward:, Be the crane.
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Be the crane. ,[picks up an I-beam],
,SpongeBob:, He did it. Yay, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the…
,Construction Worker:, You know this guy?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch. ,[pokes the construction worker], Ding. ,[Squidward knocks a bunch of buildings over with the I-beam; a sign reads ""Your New Mall"". The construction worker is ready to explode], Tada! ,[notices the mess], Ah! Squidward, open your eyes!
,Squidward:, ,[opens eyes], Oh, uhh, be the crane. Be the crane. ,[can't control crane; he whacks the workers with a beam], Look out, SpongeBob. I can't stop! ,[crane chases after SpongeBob & the workers; SpongeBob's eyes bug out so he runs away on them], Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Okay, don't be the crane! Don't be the crane! ,[Everybody runs in terror into the Krusty Krab. The crane spins around fast and heads towards the Krusty Krab and as the workers and SpongeBob duck, Squidward destroys it],
,Mr. Krabs:, What the?
,Squidward:, Oh, my. Ohhh, my. Uhh... Time to go, Teddy. ,[bumps into large construction worker],
,Construction Worker:, Just where do you think you're going, crane master? ,[All workers surround Squidward, ready to beat him up],
,Construction Worker #2:, You ain't going anywhere.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whistles], Hang on, buddy. I got ya. ,[uses crane to get Squidward, but instead gets his prize], I guess I can only pick up toys.
,Squidward:, ,[workers growl], Uh-oh. ,[fade to black, ending the episode],

"[The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Mall, where SpongeBob and Patrick are trying on shirts],
,Patrick:, Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob? ,[giggles],
,SpongeBob:, Well, according to this T shirt, it says my best friend is right here. ,[tickles Patrick, making him laugh],
,Patrick:, ,[jumps to the other side of him], How about now?
,SpongeBob:, ,[flips upside down with the arrow pointing to Patrick], Right by my side. ,[both laugh], Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other. ,[sniffs], Let's get them, Patrick.
,Shubie:, Can I help you boys?
,SpongeBob:, I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase... ,[Patrick starts crying], Patrick, why are you crying?
,Patrick:, You...found a new best friend.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what are you... ,[sees his shirt point to Shubie next to him and screams], Wait, no, this isn't what it looks like! ,[Patrick keeps crying],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, look out, behind you!!
,Nazz:, Excuse me, but does this come in...
,Patrick:, Noooo! You're not my best friend!
,SpongeBob:, We’ve gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals! ,[They tear off their shirts and stomp on them; they soon get kicked out of the mall],
,SpongeBob:, We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat.
,Patrick:, You mean like those guys? ,[points to fish dressed up in red and blue uniforms],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, just like those guys. ,[walk in the fields], ,[sighs], Best friend outfits like these really make a statement.
,Patrick:, Look at these guys!
,SpongeBob:, Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?
,Bill:, Oh, no, these aren't my friends. In fact, I hate just about everyone here, but my love for historical battles is so great, I join these losers every year to re-enact the battle of Bikini Bottom.
,SpongeBob:, There was a battle of Bikini Bottom? ,[Patrick and Bill gasp in shock],
,Patrick:, Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! A long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups ,[shows flashback of a man washing his hands], Those who spent all their time washing their hands like softies ,[shows fish's clean hands],
,Nathiel Waters:, Clean as a whistle!
,Patrick:, And those who had more important things to do with their time. ,[a Colonial version of Patrick comes out of a bathroom with filthy hands],
,Colonial Patrick:, That looks good to me. ,[walks away],
,Nathiel:, That is truly disgusting!
,Colonial Patrick:, ,[comes back after hearing that], Oh, yeah?
,Nathiel:, You can't go around our town touching things with those filthy mitts!
,Colonial Patrick:, Oh, yeah?!
,Nathiel:, Yes! ,[Patrick slaps him with a glove and they begin fighting; a battleground is shown, with one cannon being filled with filth, and the other with soap bars],
,Red Group:, Wash your hands!
,Blue Group:, Never! ,[the battle begins with the groups firing at each other. Flashback ends],
,Patrick:, And that's how we won our right to wash as we please. ,[he shows his filthy hands],
,Bill:, ,[disgusted], Oh, that's not what happened. ,[walks away],
,SpongeBob:, ,[looking disturbed], You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!
,Patrick:, Never have, never will.
,SpongeBob:, Echhh!
,Patrick:, Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob? ,[flashback starts], They only had one ice cream cone. ,[has a scoop of ice cream in his hand],
,SpongeBob:, That's okay. Thank you, friend. ,[licks it off Patrick's hand. another flashback, with them eating at a restaurant. swallows food], So, anyway, I said...
,Patrick:, ,[interrupts], Oh, wait. You've got something on your tongue.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Patrick:, Here, I'll get it. ,[grabs SpongeBob's tongue and takes a piece of meat off it],
,SpongeBob:, Thank you. ,[flashback ends], Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me.
,Patrick:, Well, then I guess we can't be friends.
,SpongeBob:, What are you saying?
,Patrick:, Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you? ,[Licks his hand and writes on a brick wall], U... R... huh... How do you spell ""not my friend""?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray. ,[sprays all around him, making a spray house], Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you. ,[takes off Patrick's coat, which reveals filth on his body],
,Patrick:, No, thank you. ,[Pulls SpongeBob back toward him by the hand and takes back his coat], I happen to like my various smells and germs.
,SpongeBob:, But being clean is so much better.
,Patrick:, Well, says you. I like dirty.
,SpongeBob:, Clean!
,Patrick:, Dirty!
,SpongeBob:, Clean!
,Harold:, Excuse us, but we have a battle to re-enact.
,SpongeBob:, Fine, if that's how it is, then ,[tears off Fred's red outfit], I am joining the other side!
,Patrick:, ,[tears off Harold's blue outfit], Fine, me too!
,Harold:, Ah, come on! Let's go play somewhere else.
,[cuts to Patrick looking through binoculars; SpongeBob sneaks up on him and gets his ""nose""],
,SpongeBob:, Ha! Got your nose!
,Patrick:, Hey, give it back!
,SpongeBob:, Not until you wash your hands!
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah? Well ,[takes SpongeBob's eyes], I got your eyeballs! ,[giggles as he runs with them, but he soon sees that they are bombs, which squirt water out. SpongeBob gets eyeballs back and laughs.],
,[cuts to scene where Patrick forms into a cannon and he blasts his brain at SpongeBob like a cannonball],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Eww, brain juice!
,Patrick:, ,[puts brain back in his head], Do you give up yet?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Patrick ,[wipes himself off],, but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me.
,Patrick:, Your pants are falling down.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Patrick:, I'll fix it. ,[Stretches SpongeBob's pants, filling it up with dirt, then yanks his underwear, making SpongeBob squish up with dirt],
,SpongeBob:, Satisfied?
,Patrick:, There, you look good now.
,SpongeBob:, You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet.
,Patrick:, Why, what's wrong with them? ,[shows his feet are filthy (they just have one big toenail on each stubby leg)],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, I'll take care of it. ,[attacks Patrick and starts doing a pedicure on his toenails],
,Patrick:, No! Not a pedicure! ,[screams], No, no, not that, anything but tha--,[screams], Nail polish?! ,[shows his feet look better], You sick little monster, face my morning breath!
,[Patrick inhales deeply and then exhales his foul breath, making SpongeBob break],
,SpongeBob:, You, sir, could use some dental hygiene! ,[pulls out a toothbrush and toothpaste],
,Patrick:, Who, me? My teeth are fine, see? ,[shows his teeth are nasty and decaying],
,SpongeBob:, A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine. ,[shows SpongeBob's pearly white teeth. Patrick screams and runs away, with SpongeBob jumping on him and brushes his teeth], You got to brush in little circles! ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, ,[throws him off], Minty fresh! Taste pit, evildoer!! ,[Patrick's armpit hairs fly out to grab SpongeBob and rub him on Patrick's armpit, getting SpongeBob's face very filthy],
,SpongeBob:, You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of...this! ,[shows deodorant spray],
,Patrick:, No! No, not...not deodorant! ,[SpongeBob sprays the can. Patrick screams and runs away, but the spray kills his hairs and the smell],
,Patrick:, ,[sniffs his armpit], My beautiful pit stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now. ,[Takes his hand off to show a human hand], It's booger time!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose. ,[pokes his nose],
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah? ,[He clenches his face, and forms a nose. SpongeBob gasps, and Patrick picks his nose],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Booger! ,[runs to the Krusty Krab, with Patrick behind him], Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold! ,[they run into the kitchen],
,Mr. Krabs:, Gold? Heehee! ,[runs into the kitchen to find the gold, but comes out with nothing],
,Squidward:, Did you get any of Patrick's ""gold""?
,Mr. Krabs:, He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for.
,[cuts to the kitchen],
,Patrick:, Ha! I got you now!
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks around and sees a knife and two onions], Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon! ,[throws the two onions at Patrick's eyes],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], Raw onions?! ,[starts crying], That does it! ,[picks up a Krabby Patty], See this?
,SpongeBob:, A Krabby Patty? What are you going to do, eat it?
,Patrick:, Oh, I'm not going to eat it. ,[pulls it apart and puts the Krabby Patty on his feet],
,SpongeBob:, No, not patty socks!
,Patrick:, That's right, your precious patties on my stinky feet! ,[starts stomping around],
,SpongeBob:, You better stop that!
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Stinky, little feet! ,[stomps and hops around],
,SpongeBob:, ,[getting angry], You stop that right now! ,[He turns red and inflates angrily],
,Patrick:, Hopping... ,[SpongeBob blows up and sends Patrick flying], ...Clams! ,[he lands in a dumpster and gets out], Hey, I got my filth back!

,SpongeBob:, It's too late for that! ,[SpongeBob breathes in deeply and starts shooting soap bubbles out of his craters at Patrick, while Patrick throws the dumpster at SpongeBob. The bubbles hit Patrick, and SpongeBob laughs in victory, only to have the dumpster fall on him],
,Patrick:, ,[now clean], My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!
,SpongeBob:, ,[climbs out of dumpster and is quite filthy], I'm covered in muck and scum!

,SpongeBob:, It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need twenty baths a day!
,Patrick:, Slather toe jam on my armpits?
,SpongeBob:, I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!
,Patrick:, Smear slime on my teeth?
,SpongeBob:, And dry-clean my uvula!
,[They think for a minute and then they giggle happily],
,Both:, All right!
,SpongeBob:, Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean.
,Patrick:, And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob! ,[shakes hands],
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, thank you.
,Both:, ,[they hug], You're my best friend ever!
,Bill:, Hey, what's going on here? This battle isn't over until we have a winner.
,SpongeBob:, ,[philosophically], Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?
,Patrick:, Squeaky clean, squeaky, it's squeaky. ,[rubs himself everywhere, making a squeaky sound],
,SpongeBob:, ,[nods], Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth.
,Bill:, Wow! I think the little yellow guy has taught us a valuable lesson.
,SpongeBob:, And what is that, my son?
,Bill:, That re-enacting battles is really lame! ,[talks to the other fish], Come on, guys, let's play something more manly, like football!
,Harold:, Or hockey!
,Thaddeus:, Or knitting fluffy sweaters!
,[All pause, and then run off, cheering],
,SpongeBob:, Come, Patrick, my work here is done. ,[walks off into the sunset, with Patrick still rubbing his body],

,SpongeBob:, No, no pushing! We share the swing. Like this. Just watch. ,[swings back and forth], Whee! ,[swings really fast], Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! ,[giggles and falls off the swing, landing in front of Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and the townsfolk],
,Squidward:, There you are!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Squidward.
,Squidward:, Don't, ""Oh, hey, Squidward"" me! Not after you lured these monsters into town! ,[picks up SpongeBob and waves the clams away], They are a menace to society and we want them out!
,[The townsfolk chatter in agreement.],
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry the clams messed things up, but you must remember, they're wild animals.
,[The clams give a menacing growl.],
,Squidward:, Exactly! And wild animals don't belong in a civilized town!
,[The townsfolk chatter in agreement again.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, maybe you're right. If you really want the clams gone, then I'll lead them out of town.
,Mr. Krabs:, In that case, let me just say this from the heart. Give me more pearls, you stupid, smelly clams! ,[the clams spit up a really huge pearl on Mr. Krabs, crushing him underneath], I'm good.
,SpongeBob:, Well, then, I guess this is good-bye.
,[SpongeBob solemnly leaves Bikini Bottom with the clams while a violin player among the townsfolk plays a sad song on the violin. The scene changes to SpongeBob swinging on a vine and giving out a Tarzan-like yell. He sits on a branch of a coral tree and calls forth the clams. He morphs into a clam so he can imitate them. Then he flies in the sky with them. Lary the Snail, Rex, and Mystery are drinking water by the stream with sand-like straws. They see SpongeBob and the clams flying towards them and run off. SpongeBob and the clams sip the water, until three sea bears came and chased them away. SpongeBob and the clams sit on a power line, but SpongeBob gets electrocuted and falls to the ground.],
,French Narrator:, One Season Later...
,[SpongeBob and the clams land on the ground to rest.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, the life of a clam is the best! ,[laughs and feels a cold breeze of wind], Brr! Getting cold out. Must be fall. I hate to say it, little clams, but it's time for you all to fly home to warmer climates. ,[the clams hover SpongeBob], Don't be sad. We'll see each other next year. I promise. Now go on. ,[the clams fly away; SpongeBob sighs and sheds a tear], The circle of life. Whelp, guess I should migrate home, too.
,[The scene changes to Squidward cleaning the clam poop off his house.],
,Squidward:, Well, it took me a whole season, but it's finally clean. ,[sees SpongeBob walking home while in the form of a clam], The clams! They're back! ,[screams as he falls off the roof and lands in Patrick's drool pool],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, wait, Squidward. It's just me!
,Squidward:, ,[sees that he's covered in Patrick's drool; he gasps in panic], Drool pool! ,[screams],
,Patrick:, ,[wakes up from his long nap and has grown a beard], What'd I miss? ,[screams],
,[Patrick and Squidward run around, screaming. SpongeBob returns to his normal form.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, have fun, you two. ,[enters his house],
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob in his bird nest-like bed with Gary.],
,SpongeBob:, It sure is nice to be home. ,[sighs and spits a pearl to turn off the light],

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are having a medical exam. SpongeBob is giggling behind the curtains and jumps up and down.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward. What do you think the nurse is doing to him in there?
,Squidward:, It's called a ""checkup."" It's an invasion of your personal space that's good for you.
,[SpongeBob screams behind the curtains. Squidward and Mr. Krabs gasp. Behind the curtain, the nurse grabs SpongeBob as if she is going to strangle him. Mr. Krabs bites his claws in fear. Behind the curtains, SpongeBob is shape-shifting himself in front of the nurse.],
,Nurse:, Sir, please hold still! I need to check your reflexes.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, nurse lady. I've never had a checkup before. It's so much fun!
,[The nurse hits SpongeBob's knee with her medical hammer and SpongeBob's leg curls up. SpongeBob's leg squeals.],
,Nurse:, ,[sighs], You seem fine...physically, at least. ,[shows her clipboard], Congratulations. You pass.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps out], Wow! Imagine if it was this easy to get your boating license!
,Squidward:, Eh. The world shudders at the thought.
,Nurse:, Mr. Tentacles?!
,Squidward:, Finally! Let's get this over with! ,[walks behind the curtains],
,[SpongeBob puts his medical examination paper in his head.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[whimpering], Ooh...So, Boy-o...how was it in there? Anything I should be...terrified of?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, Mr. Krabs! Getting a checkup is the best! The nurse poked me ,[pokes himself], and prodded me ,[prods himself], and jabbed me... ,[punches himself], and pulled me ,[stretches], and twisted me. ,[twists himself], And—
,[Mr. Krabs covers SpongeBob's mouth.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, okay. That's enough. ,[giggles],
,Squidward:, You want me to what?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[whimpering], Ooh...
,Nurse:, ,[points to sample cup], Fill this, please.
,Squidward:, Hmph. ,[mumbling as he takes the cup],
,[Squidward and the nurse look at each other for a bit.],
,Squidward:, Could I get a little privacy?
,[Squidward turns around and whizzes some of his ink in the cup. He hands the cup back to the nurse.],
,Nurse:, Hmm...good color. ,[dips a pen in the ink and writes on the clipboard], Solid line fidelity. The ink is a little thick, though.
,Squidward:, Hey!
,Nurse:, You just need to drink more water. You pass. ,[gives Squidward his medical examination paper; she and Squidward walk out behind the curtains], Is there a...Eugene Krabs?!
,SpongeBob:, Your turn, Mr. K.
,[Mr. Krabs runs into his office, locks the door, and barricades himself behind brick walls. Mr. Krabs opens his safe, takes out the formula, and hides in the safe.],
,Squidward:, Ha, ha! Looks like the old man is scared of getting his checkup.
,Nurse:, This is no laughing matter! Every employee must get their checkup or the restaurant will be closed under orders of Bikini Bottom Better Business Bureau.
,Squidward:, ,[gasps], Not the...B.B.B.B.B!
,SpongeBob:, You heard her. The...,[flaps his lips],
,Squidward:, Perhaps we could reach some sort of understanding.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, oh, I know! We'll give Mr. Krabs his checkup over the weekend and you just pick up the results on Monday. ,[in singsong as he forms the words, ""Everybody Wins"" and the heavenly chorus sings in the background], Everybody wins!
,Squidward:, I was just gonna bribe her. ,[pulls out some money],
,Nurse:, Monday works. ,[takes the money and leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Yay! We get to spend the weekend together!
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs walking down the streets on Bikini Bottom.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[humming], Dodged that bullet!
,SpongeBob:, ,[peaks from behind a building and gasps], He's coming!
,Squidward:, It says here the first part of Krabs' exam is the pinch test. We just need to do it in a way he doesn't know he's being tested!
,SpongeBob:, Way ahead of ya! ,[makes a charity box that offers free money with an empty cardboard box], We'll make him an offer he can't resist!
,Squidward:, ,[reading], ""Free Money Inside."" Ha. Not bad.
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs Squidward], Come on, before he sees us! ,[pulls him in the box],
,[Mr. Krabs comes by.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[humming], Huh? Free money, hey? ,[chuckles], Don't mind if I do!
,[Mr. Krabs shoves his claw in the box and moves around.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[humming], Where's that money? I'm not feeling any money!
,[As Mr. Krabs tries to find money, his claw almost grabs Squidward and SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay. I brought plenty of things for Mr. Krabs to pinch—a pinch of salt—
,[Mr. Krabs' claw flips the plate of salt into SpongeBob's face, which causes him to shrink and dry up. SpongeBob inhales some water in his body.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up a baby], A baby's cheek!
,[Mr. Krabs' claw chops off the baby's head, which turns out to be a robot.],
,SpongeBob:, Lucky that was a robot baby. ,[throws the robot in Squidward's face],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, quit fooling around! ,[gets grabbed in the nose by Mr. Krabs' claw], Ow! ,[moaning as the claw twists his nose], We need to test his ability to pinch something tough, you ninny!
,SpongeBob:, Tough, huh? Gosh, the toughest thing I can think of is...Mr. Krabs himself!
,[SpongeBob grabs Mr. Krabs arms and ties them together. Mr. Krabs' right claw pinches his left claw, causing him to groan in pain. The claws crack and break into pieces, revealing his flabby, soft skin underneath.,
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shrill scream], Ohhh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Me achin' pinchers! And I didn't even get any money!
,[A coin is tossed out of the box.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hee hee! A penny! It's me lucky day! ,[giggling as he tries to pick up the penny],
,Squidward:, Pinch test failed. Well, maybe he'll do better on the eye stalk test.
,[The scene changes to Tailor Tom's Tailor Shop. SpongeBob puts a sign that says, ""Free Suits Today Only"" on the store's window. Mr. Krabs comes by with bandages on his claws. He then takes notice of the sign on the store's window.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Free suits? Oh, boy! ,[runs into the store],
,SpongeBob:, ,[disguised as a tailor with Squidward as the legs], Welcome, sir.
,[Squidward attempts to walk through the disguise, but keeps tripping over various things.],
,SpongeBob:, Step up here, and we'll begin.
,[Mr. Krabs steps up on the platform while SpongeBob looks down.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[quietly], Squidward, do you have the measuring tape?
,[Squidward reaches in the suit's pocket and gives SpongeBob the measuring tape.],
,SpongeBob:, Just grabbing some measurements...
,[SpongeBob measures Mr. Krabs' eyes and wraps them around with the measuring tape. He tightens his eyes with the tape and spins him around.],
,SpongeBob:, Sir, try to keep still.
,[SpongeBob moves Mr. Krabs' eyes and they tick-tock like a metronome. Then he squeezes Mr. Krabs' left eye.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa, there! Don't you need some other measurements? I mean, how 'bout my inseam? ,[jangling as he shakes his butt],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, no, you can put that away, sir. I'm almost done.
,[Squidward kicks Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob pushes Mr. Krabs' left eye a couple times, which makes both of the eyes go up and down on the right socket. Then he shakes Mr. Krabs' left eye, but accidentally breaks it off.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Aah! That's it! ,[grabs his eye], Get off me, you terrible tailor!
,[Mr. Krabs walks out of the store, with his right eye wearing a suit and hat.],
,SpongeBob:, Tell your friends about us!
,Mr. Krabs:, Not likely!
,Squidward:, ,[sticks his head out of the disguise], How'd he do?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he didn't make the cut.
,Squidward:, Of course. ,[holds up clipboard], Up next, it says we have to get him an X-ray of him. Any ideas?
,SpongeBob:, I do have one plan that might work.
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs putting his left eye back in place.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[disguised as a photographer], Hello there, sir! Are you rightfully afraid of your own mortality? Wanna make sure that when you're gone, you are not forgotten? Well, step on up and marvel at the latest technological wonder—photography! ,[shows some photos], Preserve your precious punim for generations to come! ,[flies around and falls on his face], Conquer time itself at absolutely no charge to you!
,Mr. Krabs:, No charge, hey? ,[spits and makes himself pretty], Well...I am very ""photogeneric.""
,[Mr. Krabs steps into the photo booth.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's see...how do you start this thing? Oh! Here we go!
,[Mr. Krabs pushes the red button and the x-ray examines him. Outside the photo booth, Squidward and SpongeBob are looking at Mr. Krabs' skeleton through the x-ray.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hoo! Gettin' kinda hot in here! ,[chuckles and the x-ray continues to scan; smoke begins to spew out], Should my underwear be on fire?
,SpongeBob:, How many X-rays of Mr. Krabs do we need?
,Squidward:, ,[looks at the clipboard], Just one. How many did you set it to take?
,SpongeBob:, 25...thousand?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh...this is getting a little...,[gibberish], Eh...thank you. ,[comes out and is completely electrocuted from the x-ray], No more pictures, please. ,[walks off and his skeleton inside him crumbles into dust],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, is his skeleton supposed to just fall apart like that?
,Squidward:, Not at all. On to the next test.
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, who appeared to some what recovered from his x-ray experience, walking past the spa.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[moans], Oh...oh... Oh, what a day.
,SpongeBob:, ,[comes out of the spa, disguised as a hippie], Hey, man, you look like you've had a rough day. How'd ya like to chill out with a nice massage? It's free.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shakes his head], Free, huh?
,SpongeBob:, Free.
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh. Okay. Let's get this over with. ,[walks into the spa],
,Squidward:, Remember, ,[holds up the thermometer], this is the cold-blooded test. Just take his temperature.
,SpongeBob:, You got it, best friend.
,Squidward:, Don't call me that.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pokes Squidward's nose with the thermometer], Boop!
,Squidward:, ,[stammers as he leaves], Don't you do that!
,[SpongeBob walks back into the spa and Mr. Krabs is laying naked on the table.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm ready!
,SpongeBob:, All right, man, let's see if we can, like, work out some of this tension. ,[pulls down a rope and the mattress sends Mr. Krabs flying],
,Mr. Krabs:, Why, you—Oh, no, no, no, no, no! ,[flies into the freezer],
,[The freezer door closes and SpongeBob pulls the lever to the freezing point.],
,Squidward:, How's the cold-blooded test going?
,SpongeBob:, Great! He's in the freezer right now.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, you moron! Cold-blooded means your body is the same temperature as the water around it, not that you're actually cold!
,[Mr. Krabs comes out of the freezer, shivering in a block of ice.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward? Whyyyyyy?
,Squidward:, Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm so sorry! We had to give you your physical without you knowing, or the Krusty Krab would've been shut down, and I'd have to get a real job!
,SpongeBob:, All right! Final test! Shell durability! ,[whacks the block of ice with a mallet],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[the ice cracks], No, no, no, no, no, no! ,[stammering],
,[The ice, along with Mr. Krabs' shell and teeth, breaks into pieces, leaving him toothless and revealing his flabby, soft skin.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[muffled, lisping], Now you see why I don't like checkups? ,[sobbing],
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Yes, you failed every test today, but Squidward and I will whip you into shape, even if it takes the rest of the weekend!
,[Mr. Krabs continues to sob. The scene changes to Mussel Beach at Goo Lagoon, where Larry the Lobster is doing some weight-lifting with some other strong fish. Mr. Krabs is also there, attempting to do some weight-lifting with SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Let's kick it up a notch! ,[adds some heavier weights],
,[Mr. Krabs struggles to lift the heavier weights with all of his might while his eyes form veins. However, his arms break into pieces due to how heavy they are.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa—no!
,[His arms blow out air and Mr. Krabs flies around like a deflating balloon. He lands on a treadmill and begins to run on it. SpongeBob turns the dial and makes the treadmill go super fast. As Mr. Krabs runs, he hyperventilates and the treadmill begins to shred Mr. Krabs into dust.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stammering], Oh—oh—no—oh, jeez—ohh!
,[Mr. Krabs is now a pile of dust and the scene changes to Mr. Krabs' house.],
,SpongeBob:, I don't know what we did wrong, Squidward. Mr. Krabs looks worse than before!
,[Mr. Krabs moans in pain inside his broken shell.],
,Squidward:, I guess that nurse is gonna close the Krusty Krab after all. I wish I could say it's been a pleasure working with you.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Squidward, I'll miss you too! ,[hugs Squidward and sobs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Quit yer blubberin', boy. Me body may be mush, but me mind's sharp as a tack! And I...have a plan.
,[The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab.],
,Nurse:, Good morning! I assume your boss passed his physical?
,Squidward:, Oh, um...yes. Of course he did. Um, unfortunately, our results were—
,SpongeBob:, Uh, eaten!
,Squidward:, ,[covers SpongeBob's mouth], Yeah, yeah. Um, anyway, we thought you could give old Mr. K another exam yourself. He's in his office.
,Nurse:, Hmm...Very well.
,[The nurse walks into the office. SpongeBob and Squidward run to the door and hear various noises inside. Then moments later, the nurse comes back out.],
,Nurse:, Mr. Krabs...not only did you pass your exam, you might be the most astonishingly excellent physical specimen I've ever seen! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob and Squidward:, Whew!
,Larry:, ,[wearing Mr. Krabs' clothing], My name is Mr. Krabs, and I love money!
,Nurse:, Yes. You said so several times during the examination.
,[Larry imitates Mr. Krabs' laugh.],
,Nurse:, I suppose I won't need to close your restaurant today. See you next year. ,[leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[comes in on a wheelchair with bandages], Whoo-hoo! We did it, boys! The Krusty Krab lives to see another day! Three cheers for a successful ruse!
,SpongeBob:, Let's just make it one.
,SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs:, Hip, hip, hooray!
,Larry:, ,[comes out of the office], So, you said there would be some money in this for me?
,[Mr. Krabs squeals. Larry, Squidward, and SpongeBob pause for a moment as they look at Mr. Krabs' broken shell. Squidward touches Mr. Krabs' shell and it crumbles into dust. Mr. Krabs, who is without his shell, runs out and laughs like crazy.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You'll never get me money! ,[laughs as he runs away without his shell],

Calm down, girl! ,[a wave of water from the tears busts the door down, but SpongeBob pushes the door back up for a couple seconds, then the water comes breaking through the door and wipes out all the customers, dropping them to the floor.

,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?
,Mr. Krabs:, Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now, she can't seem to find another.

,SpongeBob:, Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.
,Pearl:, Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun. ,[Mr. Krabs opens up the door],
,Mr. Krabs:, A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower! ,[Pearl gasps], You almost stepped on it. ,[rakes the flower in the ground. SpongeBob froze in his spot],
,Pearl:, Oh, daddy! Well, good night, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob? ,[shrugs her shoulders and walks back inside],
,Mr. Krabs:, Good job, laddie. ,[winks at him and goes back inside. The real SpongeBob appears from the side],

"SpongeBob:, ,[sings to himself, then addresses Gary], I'm sorry, Gary. I thought you were done.... ,[SpongeBob is pushed down], Wow. This town is sure going downhill. ,[bumps into Mr Krabs' parked boat], Uh, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well...you know...unwinding. Enjoying the free parking. ,[The ""P"" falls off the sign that reads ""free parking.""], ,[Gary's eyes start wiggling], What's happening to your little critter here?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, but when he does that he usually finds change.
,Mr. Krabs:, Change? As in legal tender?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. Watch. ,[A penny flies onto Gary's shell],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle.
,SpongeBob:, You mean snail.
,Mr. Krabs:, Thank you, SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye?
,SpongeBob:, You said pets were not nothing but disease-carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.
,Mr. Krabs:, But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent.
,SpongeBob:, But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.
,Mr. Krabs:, I could.
,[Scene skips to the Krusty Krab. Money flies from the floor onto Gary's shell and Mr. Krabs takes it.],
,Mr. Krabs:, There you go. Bring in that change.,[money comes from the order boat and then from a piece of gum], I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!
,SpongeBob:, What's so funny, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uhh...SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster?
,SpongeBob:, Done and done!
,Mr. Krabs:, Then get back there and scrub the poop deck so to speak.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir!
,Gary:, ,[gets the coins on his shell],
,Nat:, Hey! What are you doing with my change?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Anything on the floor gains. ,[Gary gets change from two people.],
,Sun Breathe Nazz:, Hey! ,[Money goes into Mr. Krabs' pockets. The back of Mr Krabs' pants falls off and a lot of money comes out],
,Mr. Krabs:, Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Looks like I need pockets for me pockets! ,[A whole group of customers walks out of the Krusty Krab, muttering angrily.], Ah. Fine! With my new money finder... Who needs ya?! ,[slams the door], Ahh. I was about to close up shop anyways.
,SpongeBob:, Close up! Come on, Gare. You're coming with me.
,Mr. Krabs:, You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet. ,[slams a brush in SpongeBob's mouth], Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw.
,SpongeBob:, Gary.
,[scene skips to Goo Lagoon],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Uses Gary like a detector. Money comes from the ground and then a sunbather.],Heh, heh. Excuse me mam.

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[still using Gary like a detector. Money comes from a sewer.], Dirty money spends just like the clean. ,[bumps into SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, I've finished greasing the fryer. ,[barfs up money],
,Mr. Krabs:, You sure make easy work.
,SpongeBob:, Try telling that to my frizzled hands. ,[hands disintegrate],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, but you still have work to do.
,SpongeBob:, I do?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah. How about you rearrange the wall rivets from smallest to largest?
,SpongeBob:, But aren't they the same size.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look.
,SpongeBob:, Will do, captain.
,Mr. Krabs:, Now back to our treasure hunt. Eh, boy.
,Gary:, Meow. ,[eyes wiggle],
,Mr. Krabs:, You okay, boy? ,[money comes out of parking meters],
,Gary:, Meow. ,[hides in his shell],
,Mr. Krabs:, That a boy.
,[scene skips to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, ,[uses a magnifying glass], Mr. Krabs is right. Some of these rivets are off by as much as five nanometers. Well, I better get to work.
,[scene skips to Mr. Krabs and Gary],
,Gary:, ,[falls asleep],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's no stopping. There's a laundromat that needs to be cleaned out. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Cleaned out. Get it. Ahh. Never mind. MUSH!

,Mr. Krabs:, Arr, arr, arr. I guess he didn't see that coming. ,[bumps into a building], Hey, what's the big ide-er? We've just found a pot at the end of the rainbow. Aieeeee! ,[goes in],
,Old Man Jenkins:, ,[coins fly from the machine], What the?
,Mr. Krabs:, It's like taking candy from a baby!
,Old Man Jenkins:, And that old whip shoo the coins just flew from the machine!
,Security guard:, Ahh, don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.

,Tough guy:, Oh boy, I'm not gonna hear the end of this when I get home.
,SpongeBob:, Pardon me sir. You haven't seen a crab walking around with a snail, have you?
,Tough guy:, Say, are you in with those thieving criminals too?
,SpongeBob:, Thi-thieving what?
,Tough guy:, Them two jerks what stole my money. The fat one used his sneagle to swipe my coins from me.
,SpongeBob:, His sneagle?
,Tough Guy:, That's right. Why, the coins were sticking right to his shell.
,Mr. Krabs:, Arr, arr, arr, arr.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs. What have you done to my Gary? So this is what a hotbed of sin looks like...

,Security guard:, Uh...yeah. ,[Mr. Krabs walks on, then notices all the buckets full of coins sitting at the games.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps, then squeals as he looks at more buckets], Ooh! ,[pants], ,[People are carrying buckets and are putting their hands into them. Mr. Krabs gets nervous],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[to Gary], Get ready for it now, boy me boy! ,[to everyone], Ladies and gentlemen! ,[Everyone looks at Mr. Krabs.], Thank you for your money! ,[Lifts up Gary. Nothing happens.], Come on Harry! Let's go. Come on you! ,[Shakes Gary],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs! For shame!
,Mr. Krabs:, What do you mean? I'm just showing Rory off.
,SpongeBob:, Don't you lie to me! I know all about you using Gary to steal money!
,Mr. Krabs:, I got nothing of the soul. ,[Gary's eyes wiggle], I would never steal. You have to quit making up stories, boy-yo.
,SpongeBob:, I'm not making up anything! I know all about your little scheme! You're the one making up stories!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't you have work you should be doing?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's rich!
,Mr. Krabs:, No, if I was rich I wouldn't have to hire the likes of you!
,SpongeBob:, That's hurtful, Mr. Krabs, and you know it!
,Mr. Krabs:, Why you little yellow... Well, I never...
,SpongeBob:, You never what? Learned to use decent language? ,[People scream and run.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Who do you think you are?! ,[throws Gary], Jackpot! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa. ,[stops], Oh boy.
,[Scene skips to the hospital],
,Purple doctorfish:, Yeah he's in pretty bad shape with the impact of all that metal but he'll pull through.
,SpongeBob:, Doctor? How does this sort of thing happen?
,Purple Doctorfish:, I think this has something to do with it. ,[gives SpongeBob a magnet],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, my ,Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, fridge magnet!
,Purple Doctorfish:, It seems to be your pet swallowed it. It has a very strong magnetic pull. ,[holds a coin and it flies onto the magnet],
,SpongeBob:, Cause' it's a magnet! That's it, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Arr, arr, arr, arr. Well, what do ya' know?
,Purple Doctorfish:, Unfortunately, there's still the matter of the bill. ,[gives Mr. Krabs the bill],
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Oh, I can't afford this.

,Quincy:, Nice... bunnies.
,SpongeBob:, I know, I know. It's so embarrassing. ,[whispering], I wanted the one with the kittens on it.
,Quincy:, Right. ,[pulls out SpongeBob's money], Here you are, sir.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do.
,Quincy:, I don't think they go directly to Mermaid Man, SpongeBob. But, um. Here. Try this one. ,[hands SpongeBob a dollar],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffs the dollar], This one... smells funny.
,Customer in line:, Come on! Would ya hurry up?
,Customer with mask and money bag:, Yeah, some of us have withdrawals to make, ya know?
,All customers:, ,[complaining],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect. ,[gets kicked out of bank], Whoa!
,All customers:, ,[cheering],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are at Near Mint Comic Books.],
,Patrick:, One, two, three, four...
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick. Counting up your change for a pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading cards?
,Patrick:, No, I'm thinking about buying this book on counting. Three, four. What's gonna happen next? FIVE? Holy super-happy-fun-time! This book's good! I'll take it! One, two, three...
,SpongeBob:, One pack of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards, please.
,Comic book dealer:, ,[gets a pack of cards],
,SpongeBob:, All right!
,Comic book dealer:, Not so fast! Where's my dollar?

And Barnacle Boy's bunion! Holy scallops! It's the dentures that Mermaid Man used to pop the Dirty Bubble in episode four-hundred two! Wow! These must be the most valuable cards in the world! I'll treasure them forever.
,Comic book dealer:, Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Those cards aren't worth nothin'. I wouldn't put those cards in the spokes of my bike. Now, if you wanna see a card worth talkin' about, check this one out. This is the super-rare platinum hologram animated talking card: number fifty-four.
,Voice:, Mermaid Man says: ,[fist swings by and hits Barnacle Boy, while Mermaid Man barely ducks out of the way],
,Mermaid Man:, Buy more cards!
,Comic book dealer:, There are only five in existence.
,SpongeBob:, How much is it? For this one?
,Comic book dealer:, This one's just a display. If you want a real one, you'll have to buy as many packs as you can and hope you get lucky.
,SpongeBob:, ,[buys another pack], Oh, I have a good feeling about this one. Oh, come on. And it's... not there. ,[throws the cards and buys more], Mmm... no. ,[process continues until there is only one pack left], Ohhh! I'll never find card fifty-four!
,Patrick:, Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! Oh! I hate counting! Just give me what he's having! Oh, boy! Let's see which card I got! Is this a good card, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, No, it's just another...
,Voice:, Mermaid Man says
,Mermaid Man:, Buy more cards!
,SpongeBob:, Number fifty-four! That's the best card there is!
,Patrick:, It sure does the job, all right. ,[flossing his teeth with number fifty-four],
,SpongeBob:, Aaahhhhh!! Patrick, you're picking your teeth with it!
,Patrick:, I'm preventing gingivitis. ,[it looks like he already has it],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! That's the ultra-rare number fifty-four talking card! It's really valuable and there's only five in existence. And ,[gibberish], Patrick! Blah blah blzzz! So now do you understand why you should take really could care of that card?
,Patrick:, Yes, sir. ,[starts picking his teeth with the card],
,[Patrick walks with SpongeBob out of the store.],
,SpongeBob:, I can't let anything happen to that card. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy would never forgive me! Patrick, watch out! You almost tripped on that crack. ,[puts card in a tiny seat belt on Patrick's hand], Whew! Now watch where you're going!
,Patrick:, Okay. Thanks, buddy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[a bus drives towards a mud puddle on the road next to them], Patrick, look out! ,[he jumps in front of Patrick to avoid mud from hitting the card, getting covered in mud in the process. A log of mud slowly slides out of his mouth], Ha, that was close.
,Patrick:, Ha, ha. SpongeBob fly.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this is serious. You're carrying precious cargo now. You can't just wander aimlessly around like you've been...
,Patrick:, What? ,[walks into Goo Lagoon],
,SpongeBob:, The card!  ,[he jumps into the water and stops the card from going underwater by picking up Patrick as he sinks. He carries him to the other side, then puts him down], Patrick, why'd you just walk into Goo Lagoon?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you can't always expect my usual brand of stupidity. I like to mix it up. Keep you on your toes. ,[falls from a construction site and almost lands in fire],
,SpongeBob:, Ahhh! ,[jumps in a crane, saves Patrick and drags him back to his home], Here we are! Home safe home! And nothing happened to the card.
,Patrick:, Good job, SpongeBob. Now let me just get my keys. ,[pulls out ice cream cone], Nope. ,[pulls out key], There you are. I knew you were in there somewhere.
,SpongeBob:, The super-rare and priceless Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy trading card! Patrick! Where is it? Where is it? Dear Neptune! You didn't put it in your pocket, did you? It's getting all bent up! Bent up! ,[wailing], Bent up! Bent up! Bent, bent, bent, bent up!
,Patrick:, Sheesh. Don't get your pants up in a square knot, SpongeBob. I don't even believe in pockets. I keep everything I need right here. In the folds of my back fat. ,[pulls card out of his back], You seem to be pretty fond of this little thing. Why don't you just keep it?
,SpongeBob:, You mean... ,[sniffles], you'd give me your most valuable possession?
,Patrick:, I'd give you my most valuable possession? ,[They hug],
,SpongeBob:, You're the best pal ever.
,Patrick:, I'm the best pal ever. But can you do me one favor?
,SpongeBob:, Sure, pal. Anything for you.
,Patrick:, Do you mind if I hold on to it? Just for today?
,SpongeBob:, Um, sure, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Well, good. 'Cause my landlord changed the lock again.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, wait! Let me call a locksmith.
,Patrick:, Oh! I don't need any old locksmith. ,[starts picking the lock with the card],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! Don't ya think maybe... that you shouldn't...
,Patrick:, Ugh! ,[his rock opens up], Man, this card is fantastic! ,[Patrick's stomach growls], Breaking and entering sure makes a fella hungry. Hey, why don't we eat some dinner? And then I'll give you your card. ,[gets a barbecue grill], Ew! This barbecue's really filthy. Oh, but this'll take care of it.
,SpongeBob:, No, wait, Patrick! Allow me to clean it!
,Patrick:, Now, now, SpongeBob I know you wanna help, but you're my guest. ,[scrapes grill with talking card], There! Nice and shiny! ,[SpongeBob's lips quiver and his eyes are wide with shock. Patrick uses a coral stick to scrape the card like a match. As the card smokes, Patrick blows the card and it's lit on fire. He burns the charcoal rocks with it. Close up on SpongeBob's eyes as he sees the card burning as a fire alarm ringing sound is heard in the background.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! The card! It's on fire!
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll take care of it. ,[As Patrick hawks up, he spits on the card putting out the fire.], There! Good as new!
,SpongeBob:, ,[as he sees the saliva on the card], Ew.
,Patrick:, ,[flips burgers with card], Dinner is served. ,[serves two cheeseburgers on the card. As Patrick eats his burger, SpongeBob gets his burger, but the melted cheese is stuck to the card so he pulls it off getting cheese on it. A bubble in the cheese bulges then pops, destroying the card's talking feature],
,Mermaid Man:, ,[garbled as the card is getting ready to break], More cards...
,Patrick:, ,[burps], Oh! Pardon me! That hit the spot! ,[wipes his face with the card like a napkin really getting cheese all over it.], Hey! Look at that! ,[The sun sets below the horizon in the distance], Sundown already? Well, you can have your card now. I hope you get as much use out of it as I have.
,[SpongeBob whines over his card as it starts to short circuit],
,Mermaid Man:, Zzbbb... more cards... ,[the card disintegrates into a pile of black dust on his hand as the music from the card warps down],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! It's ruined! ,[he starts to cry, his eyes blow tears out, and he runs away crying as the tears rain down on Patrick],
,Patrick:, ,[he walks up to his friend], SpongeBob, what's wrong?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffles], Now I'll never have Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy card #54, the special talking one!
,Patrick:, ,[puts a comforting arm around SpongeBob], Aw... sure you will.
,SpongeBob:, No. No! I spent all my money! And, ,[gasps], and, ,[gasps], and, you bought that last pack! So there's no more left in all of Bikini Bottom.
,Patrick:, Well, how about these? ,[pulls out four trading cards],
,Announcer:, Mermaid Man says... ,[four fists punch four Barnacle Boys on the four cards],
,Mermaid Man:, Buy more cards! (x4)
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], Number 54! Patrick, where did you get these?!
,Patrick:, Well, that pack I bought was full of 'em.
,SpongeBob:, ,[makes one last sniffle as he stops crying], May I... have one?
,Patrick:, They're all yours, buddy. See ya tomorrow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[happy as he feels better], Wow!
,Patrick:, Oh! Hey, SpongeBob? Can I borrow one of those cards? ,[points to his rock], I locked myself out of my house again. ,[episode ends],

And this isn't just any old weekend. ,[gestures to ""Dance Quarterly"" calendar on wall], This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back? ,[thought bubble appears over Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in Squidward's thoughts, walking along with Patrick, both have camping gear strapped to their backs], Patrick, I'm scared! ,[thought bubble disappears],
,Squidward:, Ho-ho, that would be great! ,[jumps into bed], You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no... ,[laughs just like SpongeBob and imitates his goofy, big-eyed face], ,[hears SpongeBob's real laugh outside], What the...? ,[goes outside to find SpongeBob and Patrick in a tent, complete with sleeping bags and books, the two are laughing], SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?
,SpongeBob:, We are camping.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house. ,[camera zooms out to show tent's location],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Have fun inside. ,[Squidward leaves; SpongeBob and Patrick pull their book back out, along with a flashlight, and begin to read and giggle],
,Squidward:, ,[pops back into tent, glaring], What do you mean, ""have fun inside""?
,SpongeBob:, Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.
,Squidward:, Oh. Bye. ,[exits; SpongeBob and Patrick resume reading; Squidward enters tent again and gasps], You little sneak! I see what you're doing!
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, Don't think I can't see what you're doing!
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, You're saying I can't take it!
,SpongeBob:, But all I...
,Squidward:, ,[holds up tentacle], Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little ""have fun inside"" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it! ,[exits tent],
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Have fun inside!
,Squidward:, ,[pokes head back into tent, blowing SpongeBob and Patrick back with his loud voice], That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping! ,[runs into his house],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to Patrick], Squidward's gonna come camping with us! ,[both climb out of tent and giggle],
,Squidward:, ,[emerges with large camping backpack], Now you'll see how a real... ugh! ,[falls face forward on the ground, squished by the immense backpack], ...outdoorsman does it! ,[climbs out from underneath; pulls pouch from backpack], Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn. ,[SpongeBob takes out binoculars, Patrick a notepad and a pair of half-moon glasses; Squidward tosses pouch into the air and presses the remote, but the power fizzles and the tent appears, unassembled in a pile on the ground],
,SpongeBob:, That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?
,Patrick:, Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.
,Squidward:, It isn't put up yet, you idiots! ,[grumbles, picking up the tent and fiddling around with it and accidentally rips it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[still acting like he and Patrick are taking notes], Customization!
,Patrick:, Genius!
,[Squidward beats on the tent with a wooden stick],
,SpongeBob:, He's tenderizing the ground!
,Patrick:, Of course!
,[Squidward is still struggling with the tent],
,SpongeBob:, Write that down, write that down! ,[Patrick still appears to be taking notes, but there is just a tic-tac-toe game in progress on his notepad],
,Squidward:, ,[gives the pile a huge kick; it automatically becomes an assembled tent], Huh? Voila! ,[the perfect tent collapses to pile form again; Squidward pushes it out of the way], But what could compare to just lying out under the stars? ,[takes a lone blanket and places it on the ground; SpongeBob and Patrick applaud vigorously], Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows. ,[pulls out ""Marsh King"" bag and pops a marshmallow into his mouth], Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.
,Patrick:, ,[has round fishbowl over his head like the helmet of an astronaut suit; imitates static noise], Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.
,SpongeBob:, ,[also has ""helmet"". imitates static noise], SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.
,Patrick:, ,[static], Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going ,[static],. Over.
,SpongeBob:, ,[static], SpongeBob to Patrick. ,[static], Me too. ,[Patrick and SpongeBob start to repeatedly exchange static noises. Squidward is annoyed.], SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over. ,[holds out Marsh King bag],
,Patrick:, Yummy! ,[takes marshmallow and crams it into his mouth, smashing his ""helmet""], Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!
,Squidward:, Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls ,[holds up can so we can read its label],, just as soon as I can get my can opener.
,SpongeBob:, But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?
,Squidward:, Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.
,SpongeBob:, But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.
,Patrick:, Pretty weenie!
,Squidward:, All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.
,[Squidward begins toasting his marshmallow lightly. Patrick, sitting across from him, sets his on fire and tries to blow on it to cool it down, but the marshmallow flies off and hits Squidward in the face. Patrick gets another marshmallow and repeats the same thing twice. After two marshmallows to the face, Squidward ducks, but the third marshmallow has a boomerang effect and hits Squidward in the back of the head],
,Squidward:, Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?
,SpongeBob:, Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one ""The Campfire Song Song"". ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song.

,SpongeBob:, Squidward! ,[silence], Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪ ,[SpongeBob smashes his ukulele like a guitar at the end of a rock show. Patrick does the same with his drum set], ♪Oh yeah!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?
,Squidward:, No! This is relaxing. ,[holds up clarinet and begins playing ""Kumbaya""; SpongeBob and Patrick look alarmed],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no! I'll save you, Squidward! ,[picks up marshmallow and slingshots it at Squidward; it goes up his clarinet and sticks in the back of his throat; SpongeBob comes over to assist him], Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?
,Squidward:, Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!
,SpongeBob:, But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.
,Squidward:, ,[in a low, cautious tone], A sea bear? You mean like the ones that... ,[In an angry tone], don't exist?!
,SpongeBob:, What are you saying?
,Squidward:, There's no such thing! They're just a myth.
,SpongeBob:, Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer. ,[holds up cheesy tabloid newspaper],
,Squidward:, ,[reads cover story], ""I Married a Sea Bear""?
,Patrick:, Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly! ,[holds up newspaper],
,Squidward:, ,[reads], ""Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real""? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!
,Patrick:, Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...
,Squidward:, You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?
,SpongeBob:, Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.
,Squidward:, Okay. Then what?
,SpongeBob:, Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.
,Patrick:, Flashlights are their natural prey.
,Squidward:, You're kidding.
,SpongeBob:, Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,Squidward:,  ,[writes on notepad], Go on.
,SpongeBob:, Don't ever eat cheese.
,Squidward:, Sliced or cubed?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers with Patrick], Cubed. Sliced is fine.
,Squidward:, Yeah, yeah, and?
,SpongeBob:, Never wear a sombrero...
,Patrick:, ...in a goofy fashion!
,SpongeBob:, Or clown shoes.
,Patrick:, Or a hoop skirt.
,SpongeBob:, And never...
,Patrick:, Ever...
,SpongeBob:, Ever...
,Patrick:, Duh!
,Both:, ...screech like a chimpanzee!
,Squidward:, Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off! 
,Both:, ,[huddling together, shuddering], They're horrible!
,Squidward:, And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger.
,Both:, Why?
,Squidward:, I don't know... ,[runs off and returns with a flashlight, clown shoes, hoop skirt, sombrero, and tray full of cubed cheese; a diabolical look is on his face], Just a feeling!
,SpongeBob:, ,[horrified], No.
,Squidward:, Yes.
,SpongeBob:, No.
,[Squidward begins making chimp noises], 
,Both:, Squidward, please don't! 
,[Squidward continues hooting, stomping, and waving flashlight around],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt. ,[takes stick and draws circle around himself and Patrick], 
,Patrick:, Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.
,Squidward:, ,[laughing], You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up? 
,SpongeBob:, Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.
,Squidward:, Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this? ,[Squidward tilts his sombrero to the right, laughing, but something off-screen takes the hat and turns it upside-down instead], 
,SpongeBob:, No. Like that.
,[camera zooms out to show the sea bear that inverted Squidward's sombrero; it looks like a giant fish with the head of a bear and claws on its fins; it begins to maul [off-camera] the screaming Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick are still huddled inside their anti-sea-bear circle],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, are you okay?
,Squidward:, ,[looking bruised and battered], No.
,SpongeBob:, Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back!
,Patrick:, Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.
,Squidward:, Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!
,Both:, No!
,[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Don't run! Sea bears hate that!
,Squidward:, Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.
,Both:, No!
,[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, They hate limping more than running!
,Squidward:, Well, I guess I'll just have...
,[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, I should have warned you about crawling.
,[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward],
,Squidward:, What'd I do that time?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.
,Patrick:, Pretend to be somebody else!
,SpongeBob:, Here, draw a circle. ,[tosses Squidward the stick],
,Squidward:, Okay.
,[the sea bear comes back and resumes mauling Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, That was an oval. It has to be a circle!
,Squidward:, ,[runs and climbs on top of SpongeBob and Patrick, who are still sitting in the circle], Move over! ,[the sea bear comes up to the circle, sees it, snarls as it points a threatening claw at Squidward, and leaves], Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life! ,[everyone cheers ""hooray""],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros!
,Squidward:, What attracts them?
,Patrick:, The sound of a sea bear attack.
,[a modified rhinoceros with fins appears, snorting],
,SpongeBob:, Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Huh?

"[At Mrs. Puff's Boating School, SpongeBob is arranging his pencils on his desk],
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, miss?
,Nancy:, I don't want to have to report you again.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], I was just wondering... ,[points to the 'Homework' pencil while the other two pencils say 'Quiz' and 'Essay'], ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or...
,Nancy:, I think it goes stuck inside your...
,SpongeBob:, Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil ,[moves the pencil], and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad, ,[turns it sideways], just in case I have to write an essay.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[walks in], Good morning class. Sorry I'm late. I got caught in traffic on the way in here when that whole 'I'm-going-to-be-doing-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life' thing reared its ugly head and I... ,[Everyone stares at her blankly], Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder. ,[opens the door to show a skinny flounder from the front but when he turns sideways, he's large. The entire class, except SpongeBob, has paper faces, painted with faces, on], Tell the class something about yourself, Flats.
,Flats:, Well, I like to kick people's butts.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[laughs], What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like. ,[the class move their desks away from the middle of the room, except SpongeBob. Flats sits in the empty seat next to him], Okay class, as you remember last week...
,SpongeBob:, ,[to Flats], Hi, I'm SpongeBob!
,Flats:, Hi, SpongeBob. I'm going to kick your butt.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps, then laughs], That joke was almost funnier the second time.
,Flats:, ,[leans over SpongeBob menacingly], No. I mean it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[giggles], That time it almost seemed like... ,[Flats rips off his his chest hair to show 'I Mean It'. Horror-struck], ...you did mean it. ,[raises hand], Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Can I be excused for the rest of my life? ,[Mrs. Puff chuckles],
,Mrs. Puff:, Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mrs. Puff. ,[puts his hand down], Sorry, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats? ,[Flats approaches the board], Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats. ,[draws an image on the board], Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey. ,[has drawn pictures of SpongeBob being beat up; SpongeBob yelps], My, how very creative! We have an artist in the class. ,[everyone applauds, except SpongeBob. Cut to SpongeBob running in the halls and into the bathroom. He hides in one of the toilets],
,SpongeBob:, I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy! ,[cut back to SpongeBob saying ""Hi, I'm SpongeBob!"" SpongeBob counts on his fingers], One, two,,[gasps], oh no, that's three! What am I going to do? ,[hears the door open], What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural. ,[Martin opens the lid and sees a real sponge],
,Martin:, Oh that's real nice. ,[walks out],
,SpongeBob:, Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be... ,[Flats opens the stall], Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings. ,[Flats looks dumbfounded], Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings! ,[giggles],
,Flats:, Hey, that story really speaks to me.
,SpongeBob:, Really? What's it say?
,Flats:, It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard. ,[Leaves. SpongeBob flushes the toilet, making water spray out of his holes. Cut to later where SpongeBob is walking down the hall writing on a clipboard],
,SpongeBob:, ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this. ,[the school phone rings and SpongeBob picks it up], Death row, next in line speaking.

,Patrick:, Yeah, hey Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double- ,[cut back to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help!

,SpongeBob:, What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up.
,Patrick:, ,[over phone], No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you there?
,Patrick:, ,[over phone], Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats. ,[SpongeBob is horror-struck. Cut to Patrick's rock where Flats is sitting on the couch enjoying a beverage], I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny? ,[cut back to SpongeBob], It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt. ,[SpongeBob drops the phone and runs away screaming], Hello? Is this Pizza Castle? ,[cut to Mrs. Puff's room where SpongeBob is still heard screaming then smashes into the door],
,Mrs. Puff:, Come in, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?
,Mrs. Puff:, But why?
,SpongeBob:, I can't tell you.
,Mrs. Puff:, Why ever not?
,SpongeBob:, I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that.
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that.
,SpongeBob:, Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us.
,Mrs. Puff:, Of course.
,SpongeBob:, Flats says he's going to kick my butt!
,Mrs. Puff:, What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine! This is an adult program. SpongeBob, just leave it to me.
,SpongeBob:, Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you. ,[cut to SpongeBob eating a sandwich outside. The bell rings and everyone goes back in the classroom],
,Mrs. Puff:, Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob? ,[walks in the classroom],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[whispers], SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a big misunderstanding.
,SpongeBob:, You what?!
,Mrs. Puff:, He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend. ,[Flats makes a SpongeBob out of sand and kicks it], And maybe play some sports with you on weekends.
,SpongeBob:, I've got diarrhea! ,[runs off and sees an older flounder in a boat], Huh? Are you Flats' dad?
,Flats' Dad:, Why, yes I am.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt. ,[Flats is by the boat],
,Flats:, Dad, what're you doing?
,Flats' Dad:, Uhh, nothing son.
,Flats:, What did I tell you about talking to strangers?
,Flats' Dad:, ,[to SpongeBob], Now he's going to kick my butt!

,Lonnie:, Hi there young people, nice day today.
,Harold:, So, you like kicking butts, do ya? Well we'll show you, old man! ,[the fish start beating up on Lonnie while SpongeBob is hiding in a garbage can],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! ""BobPants SpongeSquare"". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after. ,[Flats is behind him driving a dump truck],
,Flats:, Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt! ,[Laughs. SpongeBob gasps three times and runs off while still in the garbage can. As he is running down the road, trash falls out of the garbage can, including a banana peel. Flats screams when he sees the banana peel on the ground. When the dump truck runs over the peel, it flips upside down. Cut to later where Flats is in a hospital],
,SpongeBob:, Hey Flats, you feeling better?
,Flats:, What? Where am I?
,Purple Doctorfish:, ,[walks in], Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure.
,Flats:, Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt. ,[SpongeBob is thunderstruck, accompanied with glass shattering], Those flowers for me?

,SpongeBob:, Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do! ,[cut to SpongeBob in an office building at a desk, on the phone], Hang on, I'll transfer your call. ,[cut back to a knock on the door], Who is it? ,[door falls down. SpongeBob sees Flats and screams], Flats!
,Flats:, It's butt-kicking time!
,SpongeBob:, Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is. ,[Flats cracks his knuckles more and more. SpongeBob breaths harder and harder. Flats brushes his teeth and gargles. SpongeBob breathes harder],
,Flats:, Let's do it!
,SpongeBob:, Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly. ,[Gary gets out a camera from his shell],
,Flats:, Are you ready?
,SpongeBob:, Hold on. ,[puts a blindfold over his eyes], Okay, I'm ready. ,[Flats punches SpongeBob but it doesn't hurt SpongeBob], I said I'm ready. ,[Flats tries again but same result happens], Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready. ,[Flats punches him again and this time SpongeBob giggles], That tickles. ,[Flats keeps punching him but nothing seems to hurt SpongeBob], Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you known what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow! ,[cut to next day where SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen, grilling, and Flats is still punching SpongeBob, then scene cuts to him playing cards with Gary, chasing jellyfish, playing leapfrog with Patrick, walking out of the bathroom, sleeping, and eating breakfast. Cut to boating school as SpongeBob is sitting at his desk and Flats is punching, but not as hard. He passes out from punching too much], Flats, are you okay? ,[everyone cheers], Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call... ,[clenches fist], ...'violence road'. ,[Mrs Puff walks in],
,Mrs. Puff:, Sorry I'm late, class, I... ,[gasps as she sees SpongeBob's fist and Flats on the ground], SpongeBob! I can't believe you beat up a new student! ,[zoom out of school], I'm going to kick your butt!

,Mr. Krabs:, Found out? Boy, you would have to get up pretty early to sneak a pair of buns past old, Mr. Krabs.
,Squidward:, Or before he takes off his sleep mask.
,Mr. Krabs:, How did you know I wear a sleep mask?
,SpongeBob:, Ohh please, Mr. Krabs don't fire me. Please! ,[thunder],
,Madame Hagfish:, ,[flies in the air], Eye of newt and frozen sharkskin slab, I hereby curse the Krusty Krab! ,[evil laugh. flies away. The clouds clear up],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[throws patties away], We are not a soup kitchen, boy! And these will be coming out of your paycheck. Besides, we don't want to encourage- ,[shutters], charity...
,SpongeBob:, But what about the- the- the- the- the- the-
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, boy! Spit it out!
,SpongeBob:, The- the- the- the- the-
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, let's see what's under the hood. ,[Mr. Krabs reveals a record player in SpongeBob's chest. He moves the pin. laughs], I think that should do it.
,SpongeBob:, What about the curse?
,Mr. Krabs:, Curse? Boy, let me explain something about curses with a short story me grandpappy used to tell me: Oh yes, CURSES ARE NONSENSE!!
,SpongeBob:, They are, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yep. Just fabricated superstition. Right Squidward?
,Squidward:, You're asking the wrong guy about curses, I live next to SpongeBob ,[shudders],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], See, boy, just a bonical ramblings of an old lady. Nothing to worry about.
,[Cuts to inside the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs watching out the door],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed.
,Squidward:, And why is that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, we haven't seen a single customer all morning!
,Squidward:, That's not a curse. ,[sips coffee], That's a blessing.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Yeah, you're right, there is no such thing as curses. Ha.
,[A dish suddenly falls from the top of the Krusty Krab, it startles Squidward, who drops his coffee, starting a fire, the fire begins burning Mr. Krab's money],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me money! Aah!
,SpongeBob:, I got it! I got it! ,[grabs a dollar bill and begins blowing on it], Oh, Oh Hot, hot! ,[he realizes that it is hot and slowly rips it into pieces], I don't got it...
,Squidward:, I just remember there is a no-curse clause in my contract, nice working with you.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, wait. You don't even have a contract.
,Squidward:, There is a no-contract clause in it too.
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are driving to Madam Hagfish's house],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure that even if we find that old lady, that she will lift the curse?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Don't worry, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a special technique when dealing with situations like these. It's called beggin' and pleadin'
,Narrator:, Many hours later...
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, SpongeBob. I don't think were ever gonna find-
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, look!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well I'll be the slimy, son of a slithery, slippery sea slug, boy. It's here!
,[At Madame Hagfish's house],
,Madame Hagfish:, Give me one good reason why I should lift the curse.
,Mr. Krabs:, Because if ya' don't, me business will be ruined forever.
,Madame Hagfish:, I said: give me a good reason.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[crying and on his knees begging], Oh please, Madame Hagfish. Please, I'll do anything, anything at all.
,Madame Hagfish:, Oh, I like a man who begs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[whispering to SpongeBob], See, told ya'
,Madame Hagfish:, I will lift the curse, provided you two complete a dangerous task.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, wait a minute, granny, what part of this-
,SpongeBob:, Oh anything, Great Hagfish.
,Madame Hagfish:, Bring me the sacred gold doubloon from the throat of the Giant Golden Eel!
,SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs:, Okay...
,[Cuts a dark cave],
,SpongeBob:, Well, this must be it. The lair of the Golden Eel.
,Mr. Krabs:, How could you tell?
,SpongeBob:, She gave me its business card.
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs begin walking through the cave],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-
,SpongeBob:, ...Leftover pudding. Yes I thought that too.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hold it, SpongeBob, Look. ,[points to the Golden Eel, who is sleeping],
,SpongeBob:, It's the eel. Well, nappy time always comes after pudding. Let's go get the doubloon from his throat before he wakes up.
,Mr. Krabs:, Good idea, be careful not to-
,SpongeBob:, ,[trips and falls], Whoa!
,[The Golden Eels starts to awaken],
,Mr. Krabs:, He's awake!
,[SpongeBob screams. The Golden Eel begins to mumble and swings his tail around],
,SpongeBob:, Look out for his- Tail! Quick find something to-
,[Mr. Krabs uses SpongeBob as a shield],
,SpongeBob:, ...Hide behind... ,[The eel whacks SpongeBob and he goes flying], Whoa!
,[The Golden Eel grabs and strangles Mr. Krabs with his tail],
,SpongeBob:, ,[starting to get up], Morning, already. ,[gasps], I'm coming Mr. Krabs ,[runs to Mr. Krabs], Don't go anywhere!
,Mr. Krabs:, I really don't have a choice ,[The eel traps in on Mr. Krabs tighter],
,SpongeBob:, Take, this! ,[pokes the Eel with his fist very lightly. The eel drops Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Good job ladee!
,SpongeBob:, We're not finished yet! ,[pokes the Eel again, the doubloon flies out of his mouth], I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it! ,[SpongeBob claps his hands together but is unsuccessful in catching it], I don't got it.
,[Mr. Krabs shows that he has caught it. Cuts back to Madame Hagfish's house],
,Mr. Krabs:, Madame Hagfish, we've got the gold doubloon you asked for.
,Madame Hagfish:, Finally. ,[deposits the doubloon into her washing machine], Clean free.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahh, now it's time to lift that curse, like you promised.
,[Cuts to the Krusty Krab],
,Madame Hagfish:, ,[pulls out a 'closed' sign from the Krusty Krab lawn], There ya' go, the curse is lifted.
,SpongeBob:, A closed sign?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's it? That's the curse?!
,Madame Hagfish:, You think I'm gonna waste good spells on a bottom-feeder like you? Have a nice day.
,[many customers immediately drive up],
,[now inside the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:,  Well, it's like I told you before boy, there ain't no such thing as witches, or curses, or magical beings, or-

,Neptune:, Wait! Rochelle was just about to meet her biological parents!
,Amphitrite:, Is this about turning 5,000 today?
,Neptune:, No. Oh, my darling Amphitrite, it is not my age that troubles me so. It's that our son, Triton, will not be able to share in my revelry.

,Neptune:, Oh no.
,SpongeBob:, T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton? ,[Neptune sobs], Should I put it down yes or no?
,Amphitrite:, Triton is our son. But as you can see, the king doesn't want to talk about it right now.
,Neptune:, Thank you, my darling.

,[Young Triton is seen watching a baseball game from the edge of the palace],
,Triton:, Dad, when are you going to teach me the ball and stick game?
,Neptune:, Never. Now take hold of your trident and practice your smiting, son.
,Triton:, I don't feel like smiting. I wanna play the ball and stick game.
,Neptune:, OK, son, you want to learn the stick and ball game? Well here's your first lesson. Batter up. ,[The trident zaps one of the stadium's lights. Everyone in the baseball field starts screaming], It looks like I just hit a single. Let's see if you can get a home run, son.
,Triton:, Leave me alone, Dad. ,[swims back home],
,Neptune:, ,[narrating], What was happening to my own flesh and blood? Over the next few millennia, my son grew not only in size, but in perplexing behavior.
,[A explosion is heard from Triton's door, and green smoke seeps out. Neptune opens it and sees Triton with beakers of chemicals],
,Neptune:, What is going on in here?
,Triton:, Hey, Dad, check it out! I'm studying chemistry, and I've just created a cure for all mortal diseases!
,Neptune:, ,[pushes all the beakers out of the table angrily, then grabs Triton by his arms], How many times do I have to tell you? We are gods! We don't have diseases, nor do we care whether or not the mortals contract them!
,Triton:, Gosh! ,[moves away],
,Neptune:, ,[to the camera], Try as I might, it was becoming increasingly apparent that we would not agree on the ways of the world. I knew I had no choice. There was only one last resort. ,[shows video of girls dancing on a beach], No, not that one! The Island in the Sky.
,Triton:, Isn't that island a miniature golf course?
,Neptune:, No! The one on the other side of the river
,Triton:, You mean the juvenile correction facility? But that place is for losers, man.
,Neptune:, Uh-huh.
,[One the island in the sky],
,Triton:, Okay, I'm standing in here. Now what? ,[Neptune locks Triton up in a cage], What are you doing? This is bogus!
,Neptune:, I'm sealing you inside this magical shrinking cage until you learn to embrace your destiny as one of the gods!
,[Neptune zaps the cage],
,Triton:, Noooooo!
,[cage only shrinks a little],
,Triton:, You call that shrinking?
,Neptune:, Well, it only shrinks 7%.
,Triton:, Man, that is just beyond bogus.
,Neptune:, Perhaps in your eyes, it is beyond bogus, but it is the only way you'll learn. ,[Pulls rope to hang the cage up a tree], Reflect on this for 10,000 years.
,Triton:, You can't do this, man! I've got a life to live. I can't be stuck in this cage, man! ,[Neptune leaves the island], God. I hate you, old man, you hear me? I hate you! ,[echoes],

,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? Okay, who's ready for a piping hot Krabby Patty? Would you like the first one, your highness?
,Neptune:, Recounting this sad tale has upset me so much, I've lost my appetite. ,[sobs],
,Amphitrite:, Take those sandwiches away! Can't you see the king is upset? ,[turns to Neptune], It's okay, let it out.
,[cuts to the outside of the Krusty Krab],
,Male fish:, This is a rip-off! I paid to watch high-class royal dining action, not listen to a boring sob story.
,Monica:, Ooh, looks like things may be picking up! Royal violence!
,Amphitrite:, Why have you not obeyed me, mortal? Be gone!
,Mr. Krabs:, So who's going to pay for these, then?
,[Amphitrite zaps Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined.
,SpongeBob:, Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned ,[whispers], Triton.
,Squidward:, Well, it wouldn't be the first time you've ruined everything, but the worst part is those 5,000 Krabby Patties that will end up going rotten in the hot sun.
,SpongeBob:, Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities.
,Squidward:, I do have a way with words.
,Neptune:, Oh, how I miss my son! ,[sobbing],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son!

,[bus appears with SpongeBob aboard. SpongeBob appears on the edge of the island as bus leaves],
,SpongeBob:, ,[waving], Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver!

,Squidward:, Whatever it is, no.
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, you're a man of culture.
,Squidward:, Go on.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, these highfalutin' types, they might appreciate that, don't you think? Why don't you try and razzle-dazzle them with all your pizazz?
,Squidward:, Pizazz. Hold on to your hats and glasses, people, because Squidward the Fantabulous has arrived.
,[scene cuts to the audience outside, then cuts back to Squidward with his clarinet],
,Squidward:, Thank you. Thank you. This next one, I wrote myself. I like to call it, 'Three Barnacles are a Crowd Unless They've Known Each Other for a Really Long Time.' ,[clarinet music plays],
,Frank:, Things just got lame again.
,Monica:, Yeah, well, they better get un-lame real quick, or I'm asking for my money back.
,[Mr. Krabs comes out, sticks a 'No Refunds' sign on the ground in front of the audience, and goes back inside],

,SpongeBob:, ,[looks down and picks up fingernail], Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping.
,[another fingernail drops on SpongeBob's head],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Another one! ,[sees rope], Plus some rope. ,[lowers cage with Triton inside],
,[Triton is seen on the ground in the cage looking away],
,Triton:, Hey, man, what's the big idea?
,SpongeBob:, ,[doesn't know Triton was talking, nor does he see him], Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these! ,[makes karate noises and karate moves],
,Triton:, ,[turns to SpongeBob], I'm down here, man!
,[SpongeBob looks down and sees Triton],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations.
,Triton:, Party decorations? For what?
,SpongeBob:, For King Neptune's birthday!
,Triton:, So, it's my old man's birthday. Big deal.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], You mean, you're King Neptune's son?
,Triton:, I am, but he doesn't seem to think so.
,SpongeBob:, Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party.
,Triton:, Hah! That's a real good one, man. Real funny.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs a little], Well, thanks, but...
,Triton:, Do you think if that old goat really cared, he'd have me sealed up in this magical cage with nothing to do all day ,[holds up a pair of nail clippers], but trim my fingernails, man?
,SpongeBob:, You're right. It just doesn't make any sense.
,Triton:, You're telling me, man.
,SpongeBob:, I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want!
,Triton:, Man, you're just like all the rest. ,[turns away],
,SpongeBob:, Don't go.
,[Triton ignores and starts trimming his fingernails],
,[SpongeBob presses his face against the bars of the cage in front of Triton with a hideous look],
,SpongeBob:, What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences!
,Triton:, May I ask you to brush your teeth first, dude. P.U!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throats a little dry.
,Triton:, ,[coughs], This cage is only so big man
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear
,Triton:, Never mind, just undo the lock
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at lock], boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no squares ,[start circling his face and he screams], man that really is a tough nut to crack
,Triton:, That lock was forged by the gods, not any numbskull can open like a cheap bag of potato chips they found in the street.
,SpongeBob:, Cheap bag of potato choo wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth?
,Triton:, Theres one behind that rock over there, but I don't see why...
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs to phone booth and rings Patrick], Patrick?
,Patrick:, Hey, you'll never guess what I found on the street ,[SpongeBob talks on phone], yeah, I'll hurry ,[declines],
,[the bus is seen again dropping Patrick off on the Island],
,SpongeBob:, Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about, ,[holds up lock],
,Patrick:, Hmmm
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to...
,Patrick:, ,[undoes the lock], Open!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, all ready, Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast.
,Patrick:, I just peel the stickers of the squares and put them back on in the right spaces
,SpongeBob:, Amazing!
,Triton:, Say, now this silly old cage is open, why don't we pay my old man a visit. Hate to keep him waiting on his birthday. ,[Triton flies up and turns the cage into a sports car and hops in], you guys coming or what?
,SpongeBob:, Wow!
,Patrick:, Are you going to take us for a ride?
,Triton:, A ride, that's a great idea
,[cuts to Triton driving the car fast whilst SpongeBob and Patrick are sleeping, Triton goes off-road and SpongeBob and Patrick wake up. Triton slams on the brakes],
,Triton:, You guys don't mind if pull over for a second?
,SpongeBob:, Sure Triton, what do you need to use, the bathroom.
,Triton:, No, to tell you I don't need you any more. ,[kicks SpongeBob and Patrick out and drives off],
,Patrick:, What an interesting man
,[cuts to Neptune's party],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ready for a room temperature Krabby Patty yet?
,Neptune:, Nope
,[Mr. Krabs sulks and hits into the cashier boat],
,Squidward:, Careful, this is made out of imported wood, imported all they way from the junk pile out the back.
,Mr. Krabs:, Neptune is inconsolable, if only there where something to distract him from his pain.
,Squidward:, The only thing that can usually do that is something that causes more pain.
,Mr. Krabs:, Great idea, go and play them another song.
,[cuts to where Squidward is about to play his clarinet],
,Neptune:, ,[to Amphitrite], He's back
,Amphitrite:, Oh, how...nice?
,Squidward:, If pleases the king, I would like to perform a...
,[Neptune starts clapping and Squidward gets ready and starts playing at the same time as a car horn is heard],
,Squidward:, What the?,[looks at clarinet],
,Neptune:, Behold!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[whispers to Squidward], What he say?
,Squidward:, I think he wants us to look at the O MY!
,[Triton and his car smash through the window and the crowd cheers],
,Frank:, That was incredible!
,Monica:, Yeah, definitely worth the five bucks.
,Neptune:, Son?!
,[Triton zaps everyone and locks them in a cage],
,Neptune:, Son, I demand to know the meaning of this impudent imprisonment.
,Triton:, Well it turns out you where right old man, being trapped in that cage all those years with nowhere to go but up here made me realize something, dabbling in the world of mere mortals is totally lame.
,Neptune:, And this is how you intend on showing it.
,Triton:, No man, this is how! ,[flies through the roof], Hahaha
,Neptune:, By flying through the roof?
,Monica:, That was Triton, Neptune's son!
,Frank:, I thought he was in reform school or something.
,[the Bikini Bottomites cheer on Triton],
,Purple Fish:, Can I have an autograph?
,Triton:, Sure you can.
,[Triton destroys all of Bikini Bottom and zaps his name on the ground],
,Triton:, Nothing can stop me! Hahaha
,[SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at a destroyed Bikini Bottom],
,SpongeBob:, What's happened here?Hello, where is everybody?
,Patrick:, Do you think Triton was in that cage for a reason.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], the Krusty Krab!
,[cuts to the outside of the Krusty Krab],
,Patrick:, It's still standing.
,SpongeBob:, But look, that mail hasn't been picked up today.,[shows letters in front of the Krusty Krab],
,Patrick:, Right
,SpongeBob:, We better use the secret entrance.

,[SpongeBob and Patrick look through the cabin window and see Triton eating the Krabby Patty's],
,Mr. Krabs:, Please! I'll be ruined!
,Neptune:, Don't worry Mr. Krabs, no one was going to pay for them anyway ,[this causes Mr. Krabs to cry],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, this is terrible
,Patrick:, Tell me about it, I never get free food here.
,Neptune:, Son, hear my words, I can understand if you want to keep me locked up in this cage and set me, but see it in your heart to release these others as they are innocent. Well, maybe not all of them ,[looks at the small purple guy],
,Triton:, Sorry old man, you lost me up in the hear in my words part.
,Patrick:, He's unstoppable.
,SpongeBob:, Only as long as King Neptune is locked up.
,Patrick:, You thinking what I'm thinking?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, Triple Gooberry Sundays tonight after we free them.
,Patrick:, Ah no, but I like your idea better!
,SpongeBob:, Make ready the disguise.

,Triton:, ,[doesn't notice the stove], Hehe.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, now! ,[SpongeBob shuffle the stove next to the stage without Triton noticing them],
,Neptune:, Please, no more!
,SpongeBob:, Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us
,Patrick:, You got it,[Patrick reaches for the lock], SpongeBob, scootch back a little. ,[to the purple guy], Excuse me 
,SpongeBob:, Hurry up Patrick, he's getting bored
,Patrick:, Don't rush me! Okay got it!
,[the cage disappears and everyone is freed],
,Triton:, Hehe, I was just kidding man,[flies off. Looks back and thinks he's escaped until Neptune flies in front of him], No No, please, I-I-I never meant to...
,Neptune:, Son I have tried all my life to be gentle, but this time you have..,[looks behind him and notices the destroyed Bikini Bottom], Are you responsible for all this destruction!?
,Triton:, Don't send me back to the cage man, I-I-I...
,Neptune:, The Cage! Why son you have just given me the best 5000th birthday present I ever received! You finally learnt to use your god powers. Now I know when my reign comes to a close, I'll have a worthy successor and that's all I could really hope for as a king ,[sobs], and as your father come here. ,[they hug],

,[Everyone cheers and whistles and celebrates],
,Neptune:, Now lets go home son. ,[they enter the carriage],

,Mr. Krabs:, Neptune and friends wait! What about the party? What about me restaurant?
,Neptune:, ,[from the carriage], Ow, yes. Many thanks whoever you are. It was the best day I could of ever hoped for and it's all because of your little boy there. None of this would've happened if it wasn't for his actions! ,[carriage disappears],
,SpongeBob:, Did you hear that, Neptune this was all because of me.
,Patrick:, Well SpongeBob that's...
,Sadie:, Did you hear that, Neptune said it was all because of that guy!

"[The episode begins at Patrick's rock. Patrick, who is incredibly smelly and dirty, yawns and wakes up from his slumber. He takes a sniff of his odor and almost gags. Patrick falls off from the rock as a fancy lady passes by with her worms.],
,Lady:, ,[sniffs Patrick's stench and coughs], How unsavory. ,[grabs her worms and clogs her nose with them],
,[The lady leaves and Patrick's rock falls flat. But the smelly odor from Patrick melts the rock. Patrick heads over to the Krusty Krab where his stench melts the sign. He enters the restaurant and his stench causes Squidward and the customers to run out while covering their noses. SpongeBob is minding his own business flipping Krabby Patties on the grill. But Patrick's disgusting smell attracts his attention.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffs Patrick's odor and it slaps him], Ow! ,[turns around and sees a smelly and filthy Patrick in the kitchen; he sniffs him again and gags; he pulls off his nose], Patrick, when was the last time you took a bath?
,Patrick:, Uh. I can't think that far behind.
,SpongeBob:, That is the smelliest smell I have ever smelled. It's actually quite impressive.
,Patrick:, Why thank you!
,SpongeBob:, Do you, uh, mind if I take another whiff?
,Patrick:, ,[lifts his armpit up], Take a crack at it. ,[SpongeBob sniffs his armpit and his eyes explode], Uh, uh-huh.
,[Meanwhile, in Mr. Krabs' office, Mr. Krabs is adding money in his fake bank. He puts a coin on the fake bank and a smaller version of himself takes the coin. Mr. Krabs laughs until he sniffs Patrick's stench.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[sniffs Patrick's stench and gags; he sniffs his armpit], Phew. Nope. ,[opens his fake bank, takes out his small version of himself and sniffs his armpit], Nope. Hmm. ,[peeks into the bathroom and sniffs over a customer's stall], Nope. ,[leaves],
,Administrator Flotsam:, Huh. Can't please everyone.
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh. ,[sees the fumes from Patrick's stench from the kitchen door], Huh? What in Sulfur City? ,[enters the kitchen], Ah-ha! ,[grabs Patrick and kicks him out of the restaurant], And don't come back until you've cleaned up your act! ,[goes back in],

He sighs happily as the gates open and Patrick enters the dump.],
,French Narrator:, The next...,[coughs and gags], The next morning...
,[The next day, a filthy and smelly creature covered in muck and sludge wakes up from its slumber. The creature's shape looks ironically similar to Patrick Star.

,SpongeBob:, Patrick, are you in there?
,[SpongeBob hears laughter nearby and sees Filthy Muck rolling around in the garbage. And since Filthy Muck is shaped like a starfish, SpongeBob mistakens the disgusting creature as Patrick.],
,Filthy Muck:, Yummy.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick! ,[goes to hug Filthy Muck as it gets up, but he's too smelly and disgusting], It's like you've got a force-field of stink around you. I can't penetrate it. ,[the stench pushes SpongeBob back], Hmm. ,[scoops up some sludge], Hey, maybe a little trash-stachio will neutralize the smell and get m sniffer used to it. ,[smears the sludge on his and starts to become smelly; he sniffs], Mm-hmm. ,[gets closer to Filthy Muck], It's working.

,Elastic Waistband:, What do we do, Mermaid Man?
,Mermaid Man:, I'm glad you asked! ,[Mermaid Man jumps onto the chandelier and swings off of it and jumps onto Barnacle Boy], I believe that if the Atomic Flounder were to touch that wretched growth, it would cause a chain reaction, reversing the polarity, and the molecular level, restoring Barnacle Boy to his natural state! Does that sound about right, Professor Magma? ,[A cut to Professor Magma],
,Handface:, You'll never do it! You don't have the moxie!

,Man Ray:, It stands for the Bad Guys All Together For Book Club!
,Mermaid Man:, Book Club? You mean you weren't going to destroy a library or something?
,Man Ray:, Why would we do that? We're almost to the new chapter!
,Atomic Flounder:, What are you going to do, lock us up for reading?
,Jumbo Shrimp:, Yeah! You can't prison us for reading!
,Mermaid Man:, That's right. Remember, kids, no one can imprison you for reading!

,Patrick:, Hey, what happened? Why are those squiggles on the screen?
,SpongeBob:, Those are called ""End Credits"", Patrick.
,Patrick:, End credits? But I don't want it to end!

,Plankton:, What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!
,Harold:, Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.
,Pearl:, He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.
,SpongeBob:, He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom. ,[The red flash then bursts out of the kitchen and we then see it is Krabs holding a Krabby Patty while swinging on a rope],
,Mr. Krabs:, And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!
,Plankton:, Krabs?! What the barnacle is going on here?!
,SpongeBob:, It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.
,Plankton:, That's terrible!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! But the worst part is...

,Plankton:, ,[catches the Krabby Patty], I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?
,SpongeBob:, Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech! ,[SpongeBob and all the customers start screeching],
,Mr. Krabs:, Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!
,SpongeBob:, You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!

,Squidward:, Sorry, SpongeBob. Berets are only worn for true artists, like moi.
,Patrick:, You're an artist?
,Squidward:, Yes, I'm an artist! What are you two bubbleheads doing anyway?
,SpongeBob:, We're making arts and crafts. I've been learning the fine art of basket weaving. ,[holds up basket], I made this one using designs of me and my best friends. ,[basket appears to have Squidward, Patrick, and himself weaved on the basket], And I also made this cute little scallop house.
,[scallops fly out of scallop house and commute on Squidward's face, only for Squidward to shoo them away],

,Squidward:, Ha and ha!
,Patrick:, Why is he so mad, Squidward? I was just following your advice!
,Mr. Krabs:, What?! ,[to Squidward], It was your idea, huh?
,[Cuts to SpongeBob bringing more patties out],
,SpongeBob:, Here's a whole new batch of Krabby Patty canvases.
,Mr. Krabs:, Great, SpongeBob! That'll be fifty bucks!
,Nat:, ,[hands Mr. Krabs money], It's so inexpensive!
,Mr. Krabs:, And here's your patty! One more art patty, Mr. Star!
,Nat:, It's such an honor to meet you!
,Patrick:, I can only imagine! Apprentice! Make another of my masterpieces, good man.
,[Squidward grabs the patty and starts to glue],
,Patrick:, If you work real hard, you may be an artist too someday!

,[Mr. Krabs comes to the inside of the restaurant and accidentally crushes Squidward],

,Squidward:, ,[groaning], Present!
,Mr. Krabs:, You two! Follow me!
,[Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, wow! You've been busy, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, I want you to take a look at these folks right here. Have you ever seen any of 'em in the Krusty Krab? Think hard?
,SpongeBob:, Uuuummmmm, hmm. Um, no, no, no, no, possibly, no, maybe, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no! No, sir, I do not recognize any of them, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, How about you, Squidward?
,Squidward:, I try not to look directly at the customers.
,[Mr. Krabs groans and gets a chart],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, according to my research, a full 2% of the population of Bikini Bottom has never set foot in the Krusty Krab. That's 2% of money that's not in me pocket. And when I see that 2%, I get soooooo maaaad!
,SpongeBob:, When I see that 2%, I think of pie!
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm not talking about pie! ,[throws chart away], These holdouts are probably spending their money in some other restaurant! We need to find that 2% and reel 'em in. I need you two boys to get out there and promote the Krusty Krab!
,Squidward:, Will we get overtime pay?
,Mr. Krabs:, Over-what who?
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, sure thing, Mr. Krabs! I'll get right on that. Never.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Mr. Krabs! I think I know just where to start!

,Customer:, Of course I have! That's where I'm going. If you'll get out of my way.
,SpongeBob:, Please accept one of our fliers and consider dining at our fine dining establishment the next time you're feeling hungry.
,Customer:, But I'm hungry now! ,[SpongeBob sticks up another flier], Ha-ha! ,[SpongeBob sticks up two more fliers], Okay, already! ,[Customer takes fliers and rips SpongeBob's arms off],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, sir! Tell all your… friends. Krusty Krab! Eat at the Krusty Krab!
,Patrick:, Oh, no! I knew this day would come! Invasion of the Giant Patties! There's only one thing to do! It's eat or be eaten!
,[Patrick runs up screaming and tries to eat SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! What are you doing? It's me, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, Oh, no! The giant patty has eaten my buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Relax, Patrick! It's me! This is just a cost--
,[Patrick punches SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, Cough him up, you monster! Come here, you! ,[Patrick whirls SpongeBob around, smacking him into the Krusty Krab window, sending him up into the air and knocking off the costume], Die, giant patty, die! Patties should not eat my buddy! ,[Patrick jumps on the roof and stomps on the costume, causing a lot of flyers to shoot out at SpongeBob. He sends the costume to the air.

,Patrick:, You okay, little buddy?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I'm doing really good, thanks I guess...
,Patrick:, What's this? ,[takes flyer off SpongeBob's head],
,SpongeBob:, It's a flyer... to promote the Krusty Krab! ‘Cause Mr. Krabs needs all the money!
,[Patrick wrinkles up  theflyer],
,Patrick:, Well, this will never do! You gotta think biggerer! Everyone should know about the... uh... Krusty Krab. We need an ad blitz of monumental proportions! Everywhere you look, you should see the name... the Krabby Klam.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Krusty Krab.
,Patrick:, Whatever.
,[cuts to Patrick shaving SpongeBob's back],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], That tickles!
,Patrick:, Hold still! I'm almost through! Perfect!
,SpongeBob:, Don't forget the paint!
,Patrick:, Hold on to your shorts! I got it! ,[Paints the writing on SpongeBob's back which says, Eat at the Krusty Krab],

,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are we doing here?
,Patrick:, I hired a skywriter! Oh look, there he is now!
,[A Skywriter falls from the sky and writes ""Help Me!"" on a clipboard],

,SpongeBob:, Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! ,[cuts to Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know what you're doing, boy-o, but it's working like gang busterers. This place is as packed to the gills with gills! In fact, I've seen at least half the holdouts, just since this morning! ,[crosses off one of the 2%],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! I better get back to help with the crowd! ,[he puts his skin back on],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, don't worry, lad! Squidward's holdin' down the fort! ,[shows Squidward taking orders and grilling patties at the same time], You just keep doing what you're doing and bring in that last 1%! ,[Mr. Krabs hangs up phone],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, but how do we find that last 1%?
,Patrick:, Well, there's one place we missed. That big pile of roads! ,[points to a big highway. Cuts to highway, which SpongeBob and Patrick have reached],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, uh, Patrick? ,[points to sign that says ,No Playing on Boatway,], We're not supposed to play in traffic.
,Patrick:, Well, we're not playing! We're working!

,Robo 2.1:, Greetings. I am Robo 2.1, your personal robot servant. I am proficient in providing over 250,000 creature comforts. Would you care for a pastry? ,[shoots a pastry into Patrick's mouth],
,Patrick:, Yum. Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift!
,SpongeBob:, Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum.

,SpongeBob:, What's the next lesson?
,Stickyfins:, The nearest electronic store.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you really know how to challenge a guy.

,[SpongeBob adjusts the passenger seat, which makes Stickyfins falls backwards.],
,Stickyfins:, Ooh! ,[his passenger seat shoves him into the window], Hey! What's the big idea?
,[SpongeBob drives away from the electronic store. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Stickyfins at the boatwash. Police cars drive by the boatwash just as SpongeBob and Stickyfins drive out with suds in the boat. SpongeBob drives the boat in the middle of the road, knocking over two other boats.],
,Stickyfins:, What is wrong with you? ,[falls backwards with the passenger seat],
,[SpongeBob continues to drive as Mrs. Puff and Dorsal Dan are driving up the road.],
,Dorsal Dan:, I think your sponge should be around here somewhere.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[gasps], I didn't even feel you slow down. You've got such a gentle foot on the pedal.
,Dorsal Dan:, Gosh. No one's ever said I had a gentle foot before. ,[holds up his gentle foot],

,Stickyfins:, For the love of Neptune, let's get outta here!
,SpongeBob:, ,[hums as his puts on seat belt], Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh! ,[puts air freshener on the mirror and sniffs as a golf ball gets in his nose], Oh, yeah.
,[SpongeBob drives out of the driving range and drives into a dangerous coral field. SpongeBob smashes the danger sign.],

,[A coral flies into Stickyfin's mouth, which he swallows. SpongeBob drives out of the coral field and lands into a safe spot.],
,Stickyfins:, ,[sobbing], I just wanna know...what'd I ever do to deserve this?
,SpongeBob:, Would you like to test me on road signs now? Let's see... ,[looks at road signs], ""Stop,"" ""No Left Turn,"" and that one over there that says ""Falling Rocks!""
,Stickyfins:, Wait, what? ,[gets hit by a rock], Ooh! ,[gets hit by another rock], Oof!
,[Stickyfins becomes dizzy and gets a huge lump on his head from the falling rocks.],
,Stickyfins:, ,[gets hit by a rock], Whoa!
,[SpongeBob drives off as rocks continue to fall off the ridge. Officer Rob Johnson is sleeping, with Officer Nancy munching on a donut in their car, just as they heard SpongeBob and Stickyfins speeds past them, startling them.

,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, you gotta keep your eyes on the road!
,SpongeBob:, He hasn't taught me that one yet! ,[takes his eyes out of his face], Oh!
,[SpongeBob drags his eyes on the road. Mrs. Puff and Dorsal Dan gasp as they are heading towards a cliff. Mrs. Puff and Dorsal Dan drive to a different direction but SpongeBob and Stickyfins drive over the cliff with the police in hot pursuit.],
,Stickyfins:, Ah! Get me outta here! ,[tries to gnaw the seat belt],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, you must be hungry. I've got some of Gary's Snail Snacks.
,[SpongeBob takes out the snail snacks from his pocket and shoves it into Stickyfins' mouth. The police are right behind SpongeBob and Stickyfins.],
,Officer:, This is the police. Pull over!
,[Stickyfins looks down and sees that they are heading straight to Bikini Bottom Jail.],
,Stickyfins:, Right turn! Make a right turn!

,Harold:, I declare these Fry Cook Games... open!
,[A gust of wind blows by and puts out the flame on the torch. The scene cuts to the ""Please Stand By"" screen. The screen cuts back to the stadium as the horns blow again and Harold runs back into the stadium, but this time, he's shielding the torch with his hand and panting. He runs back up the stairs to the huge hamburger],
,Harold:, I declare these Fry Cook Games... open! ,[He lights the huge hamburger, then a second later, he starts being on fire],
,Johnny:, So begin the 21st Fry Cook Games. I'm a realistic Fish Head, and it's a beautiful day here at Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum.

,Johnny:, Patties sizzle.
,[A clip of a fish bouncing on top of a large cube of gelatin and landing on a mat is shown],
,Johnny:, And heat lamps keep the fast food spirit warm... and soggy. But the real story is the bitter rivalry between former competitors Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab and Plankton of the Chum Bucket.
,[Pictures of both Mr. Krabs and Plankton appear. A clip of Mr. Krabs lifting up two barrels of pickles is shown],
,Johnny:, Who could forget the year Mr. Krabs won gold for this five hundred pickle clean-and-jerk?

,Johnny:, Not Plankton.
,[Plankton sprays Mr. Krabs with a hose. A clip of Plankton flipping around while hanging onto two onion rings is shown],
,Johnny:, Or when Plankton won the hearts of millions by performing this perfect onion ring routine... with a broken antenna?
,[A cast is around Plankton's left antenna. Plankton is shown in the number one spot on the podium this time, with Mr. Krabs below him],
,Johnny:, Krabs wasn't moved.

,Johnny:, And now, late word is that this year, the Krusty Krab will be represented by a new competitor, on what is perhaps the greatest day of his young life. ,[A picture of a shadowy figure of a body with a question mark over it appears. The figure turns around and is revealed to be SpongeBob, wearing a sweatband and sports uniform. SpongeBob is standing next to Mr. Krabs, who is sitting on a bench staring at a stopwatch],

,[SpongeBob starts jogging in place],
,SpongeBob:, I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.
,[A spotlight shines down on him and he puts his hand on his heart],

,Mr. Krabs:, And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!
,[Mr. Krabs walks away],

,Patrick:, Games? Can I play?

,SpongeBob:, You take that back!

,Plankton:, Oh yeah?! Well, I smell...,[Plankton sniffs himself], Pew! He's right.
,[Mr. Krabs runs over, his feet twinkling. Plankton does the same. Mr. Krabs makes a Broadway pose as corresponding music plays. Plankton makes a similar pose, holding a cane and a top hat. Mr. Krabs plays a piano, while Plankton blows into a tuba, messing up the rhythm],
,Plankton:, I love messing things up.
,[Plankton meets up with Mr. Krabs by getting on a small platform and pulling a lever, which goes up to Mr. Krabs' height],
,Plankton:, Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Always ready, Plankton. Always ready.
,Plankton:, Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick... ,[Plankton raises his arm and accidentally whacks the lever, causing him to lower again. He raises it back up], ...your carapace!

,Plankton:, He's not really your friend.
,Patrick:, He's not?
,Plankton:, He's plotting your downfall right now!
,SpongeBob:, He is?
,Mr. Krabs:, He's gonna stab you in the back.
,Patrick:, He wouldn't!
,Plankton:, Of course he would. Just look at him. Square: the shape of evil!
,Mr. Krabs:, He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?
,SpongeBob:, No!

,Mr. Krabs:, Win this one for the Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, For the Krusty Krab! ,[SpongeBob flips over the poles and the deep fry and splats down on the circle drawn in the ground. The crowd gasps. SpongeBob forms a number one sign and the crowd cheers],
,Plankton:, Win this one because I told you to.
,Patrick:, Because you told me to! ,[Patrick flips over the poles, but lands on the handle of the deep fryer, flinging it at the crowd and turning them into fish sticks. A vendor walks up and turns on a heat lamp],
,Vendor:, Fish sticks! Get your fish sticks here!

,Johnny:, The next event: the chocolate high dive.
,SpongeBob:, Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick.
,[SpongeBob climbs up the ladder],
,Johnny:, For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks.

,Johnny:, And now, absolute silence.
,[The crowd stops chattering. SpongeBob jumps off the diving board],
,SpongeBob:, I scream for ice cream! ,[SpongeBob flips around a couple times, then leaps toward the bowl. He lands in the chocolate syrup, getting coated in it, then hops out of it and into a sandbox full of toasted almonds],
,Johnny:, Perfect entry! And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.
,[SpongeBob lands in the circle],
,Johnny:, He stuck it!
,[SpongeBob turns around toward the camera and grins],
,Johnny:, And just look at that even coating.
,[SpongeBob walks upside-down past Patrick, using the popsicle sticks for legs],
,SpongeBob:, Top that, Pinky.
,[Plankton walks up],
,Plankton:, Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!
,[Patrick groans],
,Plankton:, Better than you!
,[Patrick groans louder],
,Plankton:, Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!
,[Patrick screams, then hops up onto the diving board with the lower half of his body inside an ice cream cone],
,Johnny:, Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.
,[Patrick slowly leans off the edge until he falls off the diving board],
,Johnny:, Just look at that concentration.
,[Patrick splashes into the bowl, with chocolate syrup flying everywhere],
,Johnny:, Ooh, a little shaky on that entry.
,[A live action strawberry cone with a chocolate dip is shown],
,Johnny:, But just look at that form!
,[Patrick hops up to SpongeBob grinning while SpongeBob is very angry about losing],
,Patrick:, Take that, yellow boy!
,SpongeBob:, Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.
,Patrick:, That's what you think, but it's not over yet.
,[A clip of highlights from the games is shown, beginning with SpongeBob tossing a patty. Patrick skates on a large grill with butter on his feet. Patrick tosses a large bottle of ketchup up in the air. SpongeBob and Patrick race on a track carrying trays full of food; the two fly up in the air on two large spatulas. They both do a dance wearing colorful outfits and fruit hats, Patrick's being 12 and SpongeBob's being 27. The clip ends. A large arena on top of a hamburger is on screen. The realistic Fish Head is still reporting],
,Johnny:, It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold? Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[rubbing SpongeBob's shoulders], Don't forget, he called ye yellow.
,[SpongeBob picks up a metal chain, bites off and chews up the middle of it. He bares his teeth, revealing the metal chain to now be attached to them like braces],
,Johnny:, Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?
,Plankton:, Don't forget, he called you pink!
,[Plankton hops away. Patrick growls as he picks up a lemon, rips it in half, puts both halves into each of his eyes and screams],
,[Heavy metal music plays. The bell rings. SpongeBob tears off his blue robe, showing off his extremely large, muscular body. Patrick rips off his own green robe, underneath which he is wearing a business suit. He tears off the business suit, also revealing an extremely large, muscular body. The two dive at each other, screaming, until they collide. They wrestle and continue to wind up in twisted positions. They spin around and wind up wrestling with themselves. They realize this, and dive back at each other. Patrick sits on top of SpongeBob, holding his foot],
,Patrick:, Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.
,[Patrick takes off SpongeBob's shoe and licks his foot slowly. SpongeBob screams in agony. The two wrestle again. SpongeBob sits on Patrick's chest and lifts up a pencil with the eraser side pointing toward Patrick. He slowly brings it down to his name tag and erases the ""Pat"" in ""Patrick"", leaving ""rick""],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], Noooo! My name's... not... ,Rick!,
,[Patrick tackles SpongeBob and the two wrestle once more before they stop],
,SpongeBob:, I don't like you!
,Patrick:, I don't like you more!
,SpongeBob:, I never liked you!
,Patrick:, I a thousand times never liked you!
,SpongeBob:, Pink!
,Patrick:, Yellow!

,[They both start crying and hug each other],
,SpongeBob:, Let's promise never to fight again, buddy.
,Patrick:, Yeah, pal. Let's go home.

,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! Where ya going?
,[Plankton runs up next to Mr. Krabs],
,Plankton:, Get back here and kill each other!

It drives onto a platform with wheels, which is attacked to a subway front car. It goes for a while until the platform is lift by a helicopter, which lifts it into a cargo plane. The plane then flies away. The scene cuts to SpongeBob, holding Perch Perkins microphone.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[While crying], Good-bye, secret recipe!
,Perch Perkins:, ,[While struggling to get the microphone out of SpongeBob's hands.], We wanted to ask Mr. Eugene Krabs ,[He manages to get the microphone free.], what compelled him to take such drastic measures.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it's simple, Perch. ,[The scene cuts to a TV screen with Mr. Krabs on it.], It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a ,[He turns towards the camera.], certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society.
,[The scene pans out to reveal that the TV is being watched by Plankton in the Chum Bucket.],
,[As the TV turns off], So, I finally got him in full retreat.
,[Plankton evilly laughs. The scene returns to Mr. Krabs' office, where Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are around the cauldron.],
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties.
,SpongeBob:, I believe we were at turmeric.
,Mr. Krabs:, Boy, I thought I told you--
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no we forgot to look at the...
,Mr. Krabs:, Formula, yeah.
,SpongeBob:, And that formula is...
,Mr. Krabs:, On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah. ,[He groans. He walks to the wall, which has the door.], And now I've gotta go ,[While hitting his head on the wall], all ,[not hitting his head], the way ,[While hitting his head], there ,[not hitting his head], to ,[While hitting his head], get it.
,[SpongeBob walks over to Mr. Krabs],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, Think you're up for the challenge?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, all right then, ,[He grabs SpongeBob by the side.], the formula is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank ,[He grabs a key.], in ,Way-far-out-town-ville,.
,SpongeBob:, Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, This, No. This is the key to me heart? ,[He pulls down his shirt, revealing a locked door on his chest. He then uses the key on it and opens the door. It shows his heart. Mr. Krabs puts his hand into his chest and takes out another key.], This is the safe-deposit box key.
,SpongeBob:, ,[While grabbing for the key], Oh, thank you Mr.--
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[While pulling it away], Not so fast, kid. I want you to protect this at all costs. You mustn't let it out of your sight. I now bestow unto you the key to the future of The Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, I humbly accept this key and vow to guard it with my very life. ,(takes the key), It shan't leaveth my sight.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,(Plankton hears the conversation with some technology of his), Good, let's get you over at the train station.
,Plankton:, This is too easy. Karen, I'm off on a business trip. Don't up wait for me, baby. ,(cuts to train station),
,SpongeBob:, The Oceanic Express. ,(train whistles), Wish me luck.
,Mr Krabs:, Remember what I told you, boy? Keep your eye on the key.
,Oran J. Roughy:, I can take your luggage for you, sir. ,(grabs Patrick), Please follow me.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, a real-life butler.
,Oran J. Roughy:, I am not a butler.
,Train Conductor:, All aboard!
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down! ,(train starts to leave as a bus drives up),
,Plankton:, ,(gets out of bus and runs up to the train), Wait! Wait for me! ,(sighs), Barnacles, I knew I should have sprung for a taxi! Curse you public transport! Why I oughta-- ,(train steam sends Plankton onto the road when a bus immediately smashes him), Oh, now they're on time... Uh-uh... ,(cut to inside of train),
,Oran J. Roughy:, Your sleeping quarters. ,(tosses Patrick in there), I trust everything is to your liking.
,SpongeBob:, Couldn't be better, butler.
,Oran J. Roughy:, Ahem. Perhaps Monsieur did not hear me. I trust everything is to your liking.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, oh yes, of course! How silly of me.
,Oran J. Roughy:, An honest mistake, monsieur.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, my good man. ,(hands the butler a used, plastic burrito wrapper), I've been hunting for a trash can for at least ten minutes. Thanks again, French guy.
,Patrick:, Peek-a-boo!
,SpongeBob:, Hey Patrick, remember, we're on an important mission here. So keep your eyes open for any suspicious characters.
,Patrick:, ,(Patrick's reflection in the mirror gets an angry face while the real Patrick asks SpongeBob a question), SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you? ,(looks back at the reflection), I think he might be spying on us. ,(Patrick's reflection goes away), Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry.
,SpongeBob:, Well, then follow me to the dining car.
,Plankton:, ,(climbs on top of a bus), Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way! ,(Plankton jumps), Uh-oh. ,(An 18-wheeler blocks his way and he splatters on the windshield. The driver is disgusted by the large green smear and turns on the wipers to scrape squashed Plankton off. He floats on down to the train), I knew I'd make it... ,(cut to the dining car),
,SpongeBob:, Ooh Fancy.
,Patrick :, Yeah. And they gave you so much food, you need 2 forks. ,(baby heard crying),
,SpongeBob:, Aw, what a cute little baby. No need to fuss, little fella.
,Nanny:, I just can't get him to stop crying. The poor dear.
,SpongeBob:, ,(sits down), Hi again, kind butler.
,Employee:, ,(sighs), So sorry monsieur. The dining car is closed now.
,SpongeBob:, ,(looks at watch), But we haven't even heard the specials yet.
,Employee:, No, the dining car is over for you. You must leave now. ,(pushes SpongeBob away. He trips over a purse. A lady picks him up),
,SpongeBob:, Oh, sorry, ma'am.
,Miss McGuffin:, That's quite alright, handsome. ,(cut to a train terrace),
,SpongeBob:, Huh, friendly lady. Well, Patrick, we'd better find a safe place to store this for the night. ,(SpongeBob is holding the key but it's not there),
,Patrick:, What is that?
,SpongeBob:, That my dear Patrick is—the key! ,(sees it missing), Patrick, where is the key? Oh, no, I took a solemn oath. ,(Plankton is walking by angrily),
,SpongeBob:, Plankton! You stole the safety-deposit key.
,Plankton:, Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen it—yet.
,SpongeBob:, Oh yeah? Well no offense, but I don't believe you.
,Plankton:, You calling me a liar?
,SpongeBob:, Yes. Search him, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,(puts on latex gloves), With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty.
,Plankton:, Oh, drat.
,Patrick:, ,(picks up bowl), Just after I scrub this bowl. ,(scrubs bowl), Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you. ,(takes out some clamps. Plankton gasps), After my tasty snack. ,(uses the clamp to crush the nut. Plankton runs and screams), He's clean. ,(drops Plankton),
,Plankton:, ,(grunts), I told you I wasn't lying.
,SpongeBob:, Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops.
,Patrick:, ,(puts his head out the window), Cops, I need you! ,(cut to the Krusty Krab),
,Crowd:, ,(chanting), We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!
,Customer:, Just give me a patty, man.
,Squidward:, For the last time, we're out of patties. ,(customers shout), No need to get excited now.
,Customer:, We want our patties, man. ,(destroys the cash register),
,Squidward:, That's Krusty Krab property. ,(another customer rips off a pole), That's a load-bearing column. ,(customer swings the pole at Squidward. He ducks), Hurry, SpongeBob. ,(cut to train being stopped and all riders are outside the train),
,SpongeBob:, As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act. ,(SpongeBob points at the baby), Where were you at 6:42pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff.
,Plankton:, Oh brother.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Police Commissioner?
,Commissioner:, Yes, Mr. SquarePants?
,SpongeBob:, I sub-- ,(turns around and walks into the policeman), I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.
,Nanny:, ,(nervous chuckling), I haven't stolen a thing.
,SpongeBob:, Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key.
,Commissioner:, Yes, Mr. SquarePants. ,(uses tongs to dig into the diaper. A metal sound clinks), Aha!
,SpongeBob:, The key!
,Commissioner:, ,(uses tongs to take out a huge diamond), At least I found it. Thank you, Mr. SquarePants. You uncovered Neptune's jewel of the sea and nabbed the infamous Jewel Triplets Gang.
,SpongeBob:, Triplets?
,Baby Triplet:, ,(deep voice), I told you taking the train was a mistake.
,Triplet #2:, ,(reveals himself being the legs of the nanny), Well, we wouldn't be on the lam if you hadn't applied for that discount card.
,Baby Triplet:, Well, can I help it if I'm frugal?
,Commissioner:, Tell it to your cellmate, junior. ,(handcuffs the baby),
,SpongeBob:, If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.
,Oran J. Roughy:, ,(sighs), I certainly did not.
,SpongeBob:, We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.
,Oran J. Roughy:, For the last time, I am not a butler. I don't even have the butler accent.
,Patrick:, You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf? ,(there is a full moon. A fish walks up and grows hair and changes into a werewolf. He howls and runs off),
,Plankton:, Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover! ,(gets hit with a piece of popcorn from Patrick),
,Patrick:, Sorry. ,(chomps on his popcorn),
,Plankton:, Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin.
,Oran J. Roughy:, I do not have a cabin. I sleep on the luggage.
,Plankton:, Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key.
,SpongeBob:, Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself.
,Plankton:, Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key.
,SpongeBob:, I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down. ,(a big muscular police officer comes and turns the butler upside-down and shakes him. Plankton falls on the ground and gets hit with a nail clipper, a hammer, and an anvil from the butler's pockets),
,Keystone Cop:, Nothing suspicious here. ,(the butler's mask falls off), Except for the fact that you just outed Oran J. Roughy, international fugitive wanted for the embezzlement of over 75,000 bucks worth of ham sandwiches. ,(Patrick screams),
,SpongeBob:, After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs. ,(sobs), I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab.
,Patrick:, ,(picking his teeth with the key), Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up.
,SpongeBob:, The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?
,Patrick:, I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little ""accident"" earlier.
,SpongeBob:, Well, that is great news.
,Patrick:, ,(yawns), Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, yeah, me, too. ,(runs up into the train),
,Plankton:, ,(hiding behind the door hinges), Me, three. ,(laughs. Cut to the train moving. SpongeBob and Patrick are grunting as they try to get cozy in their very tight space of cabin),
,Patrick:, Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows.
,SpongeBob:, I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite.
,Plankton:, Here, maybe I can help. ,(opens window. SpongeBob and Patrick stick out their tongues like dogs),
,SpongeBob:, ,(sighs), Fresh water.
,Patrick:, What a cool view.
,Plankton:, Yeah, have a better look. ,(hits them both with a 2x4, sending them out of the train and down a sandy hill. Train whistles), And thanks for the key!
,Patrick:, Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob? ,(SpongeBob runs off), Guess not. ,(runs after him),
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?
,Patrick:, Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?
,SpongeBob:, That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the? ,(they come to a cliff. The train is still riding off),
,Patrick:, Great, now what?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, hop up on my back.
,Patrick:, Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride.
,SpongeBob:, Just do it.
,Patrick:, Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr-- ,(screams. SpongeBob jumped off the cliff), Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please! ,(crying. SpongeBob flips onto Patrick's back and turns himself into a hang-glider), Hey, we're flying!
,SpongeBob:, There you go, buddy. ,(sets Patrick on top of the train. They both go into the train in search of Plankton), Oh, Plankton!
,Patrick:, You can't hide forever. ,(both yelp as a bunch of luggage falls on them),
,Plankton:, Looks like you've got a lot on your mind. ,(Plankton runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick chase after him through many train doors of the caboose and the coaches and head through the coal tender and enter the engine's cabin),
,SpongeBob:, Alright, Plankton, end of the line! ,(sees the train controls, only to find that Plankton is not there), Plankton!
,Plankton:, Over here, choo-choo heads. ,(laughs as he closes the door and then separates the train by uncoupling the tender, coaches, and caboose from the engine),
,Patrick:, That was odd.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, and Plankton still has the key. ,(sees the head of the train getting farther away from the rest of it), Patrick, we've got a big problem. Look.
,Patrick:, Hey, where'd all those—those shiny tubes?
,SpongeBob:, That's just it, Patrick, they aren't there.
,Patrick:, Hmm. In that case... ,(both he and SpongeBob scream. Back to the other train parts with the tender, coaches, and caboose),
,Fish #1:, Hey, what's going on?
,Fish #2:, I've got places to be.
,Fish #3:, Let's go already!
,Plankton:, ,(opens one of the train doors and we see Far-Out-Ville and the bank across the way), It's too easy. ,(back to the head of the train),
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, we have to stop this thing! Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open.
,Patrick:, What do I do? What do I do? ,(reads the brake signal), B-R-A-K-E. BRAKE. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over. ,(shows the brake signal in his hand that he just broke),
,SpongeBob:, ,(peers back and screams in fear when he sees that Patrick has broken the brake signal off), You broke the brake?
,Patrick:, It told me to.
,SpongeBob:, What do we do now? ,(starts pushing the buttons and messing around with the controls), Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!
,Patrick:, I'm on it. ,(starts shoveling coal into the engine's firebox), Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help. ,(The train engine overheats and runs out of control as if it might fall apart. At a train signal station, SpongeBob and Patrick signal for help over the radio),
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, We're on an out-of-control train! ,(man spits out his coffee),
,Man:, This is control station to engine five. Do you copy?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy. I'm SpongeBob and I'm on an out-of-control train.
,Man:, Kid, let me talk to the engineer.
,SpongeBob:, Um, who?
,Man:, The guy driving the train.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, th-that would be me. And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Hi.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, the back of the train is gone!
,Man:, Oh, no. ,(looks at map), The train's headed straight for the rest home. ,(picture of Rest Home), And that means...
,SpongeBob:, Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?
,Man:, ,(snaps on helmet), It means that train's coming right through that-- ,(the train engine crashes through the train depot), Beware the twisted trestles, kid! ,(lets go of the train engine),
,SpongeBob:, What is that?
,Man:, ,(points), That's that. ,(the train engine does some loop-de-loops. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and laugh),
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ,(sigh), That was fun.
,Patrick:, Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us! ,(runs faster than the engine and holds up a 'STOP' sign. The train keeps going. Patrick tries again but uses a lemonade stand), Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon... ,(groans. The train engine passes by), Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade! ,(runs past the train again),
,SpongeBob:, 'Attaboy, Patrick. Don't give... ,(Patrick puts down a giant piece of coral rock. The overheating engine flips around and slides on the tracks),
,Patrick:, Hey. Hey, wait for me... ,(climbs into the engine's cabin), Hey, SpongeBob! ,(the train engine crashes through a tunnel),
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Whoa! ,(the overheating train engine is getting near the Rest Home),
,Rest Home Citizen:, There's a train behind you.
,Rest Home Citizen #2:, How many times do you think I'm falling for that one?
,Patrick:, Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick. ,(the train engine stops before hitting the Rest Home. One of the citizens peeks at the other ones cards),
,Rest Home Citizen #2:, Hey! ,(SpongeBob and Patrick sigh),
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, oldsters, we'd love to stay and help you clean up the mess, but we've got a formula to save. ,(the train engine starts again but back toward Far-Out-Ville),
,Patrick:, Hmm. ,(reads the throttle letters), T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Brake! I can do that. ,(breaks the throttle handle. Walks up to SpongeBob), You didn't need this, did you? ,(The engine starts to increase its speed and go faster and faster. Cut to the bank),
,Plankton:, Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha. ,(uses ladder to get up to the safe-deposit box), Come to papa! ,(opens box and gets formula), At last, my day of triumph has come! Again.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, well. ,(turns on a light),
,Plankton:, What? B-b-but how?
,Mr. Krabs:, You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?
,Plankton:, I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,(laughs), Sure. I believe ya. ,(grabs Plankton), Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton. ,(as he puts Plankton in his safe-deposit box, Plankton jumps out and gets the formula), Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?
,Plankton:, Checkmate, Krabs! ,(laughs evilly. The runaway engine runs into the bank and squishes Plankton), Ow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Good job, boyo.
,SpongeBob:, I simply refused to fail, sir.
,Bank Teller:, ,(clears throat), That's all very wonderful, but do you mind telling me how you intend to pay for the damage to the bank?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'! Take care of it, will ya boy?
,Bank Teller:, ,(grabs Mr. Krabs), Not so fast, Krabs. Looks like you have just enough in your bank account to cover the cost.
,Mr. Krabs:, Noooooooooooooooo!
,Narrator:, 75 years later...
,SpongeBob:, ,(now old and in a futuristic Bikini Bottom), And that was the story of the great train caper. Didn't you find it exciting?
,SpongeBob's Grandson:, ,(playing a game), Shh! I just beat my high score! Oh, yeah!
,SpongeBob:, Kids today. ,(snores),

"[The episode begins with Sandy having a relaxing day at her treedome. When suddenly she hears a honking noise.],
,Sandy:, Huh?
,[A package from above falls in front of her door.],
,Sandy:, ,[gasps], It's here! Yee-Haw! My newest science book has arrived! I wonder what new and fantastic area of science will be revealed to me this month! ,[Another rock bangs her head revealing bloomers in a balloon.], Oh, hey! It's those fancy bloomers I ordered too! This day keeps getting better! ,[She walks into treedome, sits at picnic table, opens box and reads her new book.], Ahh! Behavorial psychology is the study of people and their habits. I studied underwater chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but I never studied underwater people!
,[The scene changes to Sandy riding on a bus. She turns on her recording device and begins analyzing.],
,Sandy:, Sandy Cheeks. Day one of behavioral study of subjects in Bikini Bottom. Initiating observations, ,[checks her watch], now!
,[Sandy begins her observations as she looks carefully at the fish riding in the bus.],
,Charlie:, My mom says she wouldn't even try it. No matter how much I saw the lagoons.
,Amanda's mother:, My daughter Amanda is exactly the same. It's always an argument, but I've tried to...
,[Sandy interrupts the conversation by sliding in between Fred and Charlie and begins observing.],
,Sandy:, Older lumpy looking female subject. Obviously, a mother. Hates daughter.
,Amanda's mother:, Excuse me?
,Sandy:, Subject asked to be excused, but I am unable to observe what she wishes to be excused from.
,Fred:, Hey! Creepy squirrel! What's with all the eavesdropping?
,Charlie:, Take a hike, mammal!
,Sandy:, Emotional state seems to be rising in anger. Eyebrows are now considerably burrowed.
,[As she is observing, Charlie and Fred push Sandy off the seat and the driver kicks her out of the bus. Sandy lands on the ground and straightens herself out.],
,Sandy:, I gotta find new subjects.
,[The driver throws her recorder and microphone at her head.],
,Sandy:, Who won't mind being observed.
,[Sandy sees SpongeBob and Patrick running around playing.],
,Sandy:, Eureka!
,Prospector:, Hey, that's my line!
,[Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,Sandy:, Hey, fellas! How'd you like to be part of my cool experiment?
,[Patrick breathes green air out of his mouth and his face is charred.],
,Patrick:, Ooh! I could use a mint! Mmm!
,Sandy:, No, Patrick. It's an experiment in behavioral psychology.
,Patrick:, That doesn't sound tasty.
,SpongeBob:, What do we have to do?
,Sandy:, It's easy. I observe you while you two act normal.
,SpongeBob:, Act normal?
,Sandy:, Yeah. Just do what you naturally do. ,[holds out recorder and microphone], Be natural. Starting now!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick stand straight like robots.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, natural greeting to you, friend.
,Patrick:, Natural greeting returned.
,[Sandy didn't find that impressive so she did some hand gestures to make SpongeBob and Patrick do something else.],
,SpongeBob:, Would you like to have some natural fun?
,Patrick:, Oh, yes. Please.
,SpongeBob:, Naturally. ,[laughs nervously and sweats],
,Sandy:, Aww. Alright. Experiment's done.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick move back to their positioned places.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What are the results?
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Hey, did we do good?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, can I have an A+?
,Patrick:, Oh! Oh! Yeah! ,[squishes SpongeBob], I want an A+ too!

,Sandy:, Yes, yes. You both get an A+.
,SpongeBob:, Whoo!
,Patrick:, I knew it!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick hive-five each other.],
,Sandy:, Subjects acting natural. Resume observation.
,SpongeBob:, I got an A+!
,[Sandy holds out her microphone and SpongeBob and Patrick stopped moving around and went back to standing up straight like robot as they did before. She pulls the microphone back and they both start moving again.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, A+! A+! A+!
,Sandy:, Oh, forget it.
,[The scene changes to Sandy looking at her book while SpongeBob and Patrick dance around inside SpongeBob's house.],
,Sandy:, When a subject is aware of being observed, it can affect his or her actions and create inaccurate data. Hmm...
,[Sandy looks at SpongeBob and Patrick laughing through the window. They both slip inside the house quietly.],
,Sandy:, Double eureka!
,Two Prospectors:, That's our line!
,[The scene changes to the Sandy inside the house with SpongeBob and Patrick.],
,Sandy:, Hey! Are you guys up for another experiment?
,SpongeBob:, Oh boy! Am I ever! Can you hook us up to electrodes? Or. Or expose us to gamma rays?
,Patrick:, Yeah?
,Sandy:, It's a guaranteed A+.
,Patrick:, Oh! It's like a dream!
,Sandy:, Ok. First thing. Go to the beach and fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand. Can you do that?
,SpongeBob:, Easy sneezy!
,[Patrick sneezes on SpongeBob. SpongeBob is covered in saliva and Patrick's brain is sticking out of Patrick's nostril. Patrick sniffs his brain back into his head.],
,Sandy:, ,[grossed out], Eew.
,Patrick:, Hey, yeah. Whatever he said.
,Sandy:, Then off you go.
,[Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick leaves the house.],
,Sandy:, Time to get to work.

,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[offscreen], Sandy!
,[Sandy pushes Gary out of sight. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive with two buckets of white and black sand.],
,SpongeBob:, We're back!
,Sandy:, Good job, fellers!
,Patrick:, We're an awesome team!
,SpongeBob:, We sure are, buddy!
,Sandy:, Ok, team. For this experiment, I need you to count the grains of sand in each bucket. Then tell me if there are more black grains or more white grains. Or is it the same amount. Alright then. I have to run some errands, but I'll be back later. ,[walks out],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Aye-aye, Captain Sandy.
,Sandy:, Oh. And Patrick, you're in charge.
,[Patrick's brain flips and Patrick is speechless. Sandy leaves the house. Outside, an ice cream truck called Pavlovi's Ice Cream was sitting near the house. Inside the truck, Sandy is secretly beginning her experiment with a computer system installed in the truck.],
,Sandy:, ,[snickers], All systems check.
,SpongeBob:, Well, let's get counting. Should we both count white sand and move onto the black sand or do you want to have your own bucket?
,[While SpongeBob is talking, Patrick begins to think about what Sandy said before she left.],
,Patrick:, ,[thinking], I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
,SpongeBob:, So, what's it gonna be boss?
,Patrick:, Uh, the first one?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], You're in charge.

,Patrick:, Uh. Huh? What?
,SpongeBob:, Huh. Lost you there for a bit. We were at forty-seven.
,Patrick:, ,[angry], I don't know if I wanna do it this way.
,SpongeBob:, Ok, boss man. How do you wanna do it?
,Patrick:, Uh... ,[thinks],
,SpongeBob:, How about you count the white and I count the black sand.
,Patrick:, Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
,[Patrick switches buckets with SpongeBob and counts the grains of white sand.],
,Patrick:, Forty-eight, forty-... nine, ,[grabs a grain and looks closely at it], Oh! Oh, fifty!
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts counting the black sand], One, two, three, four, five. six,...
,Both:, Seven, eight, nine, ten.
,[They both stop. SpongeBob smiles at Patrick and Patrick groans in frustration. Meanwhile outside, Sandy is preparing ice cream dishes she is about to use as part of her experiment.],
,Sandy:, Time to initiate the first variable. One big bowl. One small bowl. Exactly eight ounces per bowl. ,[puts on fake mustache and speaks through microphone], Free ice cream! Free ice cream! One day only! Get your free ice cream!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick hears the ice cream truck outside.],
,Patrick:, Oh boy! Let's go!
,SpongeBob:, You're the boss!
,[Squidward, who is reading a magazine, hears the truck as well.],
,Sandy:, Free ice cream!
,Squidward:, Oh my sea stars! Free ice cream!
,Sandy:, ,[in Italian accent], Hey, boys! How'd ya like a nice free bowl of tootsie frootsie ice cream?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick jump in excitement.],
,Sandy:, Okie dokie!
,[Sandy gives SpongeBob and Patrick the bowls of ice cream and they head back in the House. Squidward comes up to the truck.],
,Squidward:, One free ice cream, please?
,Sandy:, ,[stunned], All sold out. Maybe I'll get some later.
,[Sandy closes the awning on Squidward's nose. Squidward pulls his nose out and walks back to his house, grumbling. Inside SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting on the sofa holding their bowls.],
,Patrick:, Um. Uh. Your.. your bowl is bigger!
,SpongeBob:, Do you wanna trade?
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick trade their bowls. Patrick's bowl only has a small amount of ice cream in it. Patrick looks at the bowl and sees SpongeBob has more ice cream in it.],
,Patrick:, You got more ice cream!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I think your ice cream only looks smaller, but the bowl is big.
,Patrick:, Well, I wanna trade back!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick trade their bowls again. But Patrick realizes that he has the small bowl again.],
,Patrick:, There's only one fair thing to do.
,SpongeBob:, What's that?
,[Patrick grabs SpongeBob's bowl and he eats the ice cream from both big and small bowls.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you call that fair?
,[Patrick throws the bowls away.],
,Patrick:, I'm in charge!
,SpongeBob:, Uh... Oh. Yeah.
,Sandy:, Time for variable two. More free ice cream here! Now, with the same size cones!
,Squidward:, Huh? I just got my slippers on!
,Sandy:, Here ya go!
,[Patrick grabs the cones before SpongeBob.],
,Patrick:, I'll take those my good man.
,SpongeBob:, But Patrick, I...
,Patrick:, I'm in charge.
,[Squidward shows up.],
,Squidward:, One free cone, please?
,Sandy:, All gone!
,[Sandy closes the awning on Squidward's hands. Squidward pulls his hands out and walks back to his house, grumbling.],
,Squidward:, For the love of Pete!
,SpongeBob:, Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now? Can I have my cone now?
,Patrick:, Hmmm... ,[sits on SpongeBob's chair], Rub my feet first!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, come on!
,Patrick:, Who's in charge?
,SpongeBob:, Alright, I'll rub your feet.
,[SpongeBob cringes when he sees how hideous Patrick's feet were, but he rubs them anyway. He then notices his cone is melting in Patrick's hand.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! My ice cream is melted all over your hand!
,Patrick:, Oh... I'll fix that.
,[Patrick licks SpongeBob's melting ice cream cone.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you are making very poor choices!
,Patrick:, Don't you back-sass me! I'm in charge and you have to do what I say! Now, count that bucket of white sand.
,SpongeBob:, Alright, I will!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob counting the white sand while his cone is melting in Patrick's hand.],
,SpongeBob:, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and one, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and two, One-million eight hundred ninety-three thousand six hundred and three.
,[SpongeBob's bucket is completely empty, but his ice cream cone is still melting.],
,SpongeBob:, Done! Now to count the black sand.
,[Patrick selfishly kicks the bucket of black sand.],
,Patrick:, Oh, that's a pity.
,[Patrick steps on the sand and swirls around together.],
,Patrick:, Looks like you'll have to start over.
,SpongeBob:, Ahhhh! ,[angry], Enjoying that ice cream, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Yes I am.
,SpongeBob:, Would you like sprinkles on it?
,[SpongeBob puts a handful of white sand on Patrick's ice cream cone.],
,Patrick:, Hey!
,[Patrick drops his cone on the sand and arrogantly eats SpongeBob's melted cone. SpongeBob becomes enraged at Patrick's selfish behavior as steam comes out of his holes. However, Sandy discovers what is happening during her experiment.],
,Sandy:, Jeepers! I didn't see that comin'!
,[SpongeBob decides to leave his house but Patrick locks the door.],
,Patrick:, You're not leaving until I say so!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick glare at each and begin circling around as they are ready to fight. Gary watches nervously at the confrontation.],
,Sandy:, ,[voiceover], Sandy to Gary! Sandy to Gary! How serious is the situation?
,Gary:, Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
,Sandy:, Oh, I didn't think this all the way through! I've gotta shut this down!
,[Sandy activates the emergency button and the siren goes off.],
,Squidward:, Ah-ha!
,[Squidward runs out.],
,Squidward:, I want my free...
,[Sandy opens the door, which sends Squidward flying head first into the sand. Sandy races out of the truck and accidentally steps on Squidward. Squidward pops his head out of the sand.],
,Sandy:, ,[pulls on the door], Open the door! The experiment is over! ,[knocks on it], Open the door!
,Patrick:, You heard Sandy! Open the door!
,SpongeBob:, You open it!
,Patrick:, No, you open it!
,SpongeBob:, No, you open it!
,[Sandy kicks the door open.],
,Patrick:, Mr. Pavlovi, tell SpongeBob to open the door!
,Sandy:, ,[takes off her fake mustache], It's me! Sandy!
,[Patrick's anger disappears and his head pops in sudden realization.],
,Sandy:, The experiment is over!
,SpongeBob:, But we didn't even finish counting the sand!
,Sandy:, I didn't care about the sand! I just wanted to observe you acting naturally. So, I hid microphones and cameras around your house...
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Cameras?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick looks around and sees that Sandy was right. There were cameras and microphones hidden around the house. The stood straight like robots as they did at the beginning. SpongeBob then notices Gary wearing a pair of headsets and a camera on his shell, realizing that he was in on Sandy's experiment too.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sadly], Et tu, Gary?
,Gary:, Meow.
,[Patrick, upon realizing that he got carried away with being in charge, breaks down in tears.],
,Patrick:, I was a monster! I deserve a Z-! ,[sobs],
,SpongeBob:, Aww, Patrick. Don't be so hard on yourself. It was the experiment's fault that you were such a jerk.
,Patrick:, I blame science! Stupid science!
,Sandy:, Everybody gets an A+ and ice cream!
,SpongeBob:, Oh yeah!
,Patrick:, ,[laughs],
,[Squidward steps out of the sand and hears laughter in SpongeBob's house. He steps in the house.],
,Squidward:, What is going on?
,[Squidward sees SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Gary incredibly full from eating ice cream.],
,Squidward:, I know it's a stupid question but is there any ice cream left?
,Sandy:, ,[groans], Sorry. We're all out.
,Squidward:, ,[starts a tantrum], You ate it all! You animals! You didn't even leave me one drop?! ,[picks up an empty ice cream container and looks in it], There's gotta be some left in here!
,[Squidward looks through all the containers and starts crying. Sandy, SpongeBob, Gary, and Patrick leave.],
,Sandy:, Now, let the real experiment begin.
,[Sandy pulls the pineapple costume off, revealing that it was a cage in disguise as SpongeBob's house. Squidward continues looking for ice cream in one of the containers.],
,Squidward:, Come on! Get in my mouth! No, this one's empty!
,[The episode ends with Squidward in the cage crying for ice cream while SpongeBob, Sandy, Gary, and Patrick begin studying his behavior patterns.],

"SpongeBob:, Good morning, pineapple! ,[plays the bugle to wake Gary up], Good morning, Gary! ,[pats Gary's shell],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens his front door], Good morning, world! I'm ready! World? ,[scene pans over to Squidward's front door, where a delivery man with a pet cage walks over and knocks on his door],
,Squidward:, Talk to me.
,Delivery Man:, ,[waves hat], Package, sir.
,Squidward:, A-ha! ,[Squidward signs a clipboard], I can't believe it's finally here! ,[delivery man hands him the cage],
,Delivery Man:, Here ya go!
,Squidward:, Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. ,[hands him the clipboard],
,Delivery Man:, Thank you, Mr... mmm... ""Tennisballs.""
,Squidward:, ,[winces, then scowls], That's Tentacles! ,[takes pet cage and slams the door shut],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward's last name is Tentacles?
,Patrick:, Poor guy. ,[Squidward walks out with a new snail with a bow on her shell], Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whistles as Squidward frowns], Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
,Squidward:, Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob. ,[holding his snail smugly], I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.
,Patrick:, Wow, a snail made out of bread.
,Squidward:, No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See? ,[holds up a certificate], She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.
,SpongeBob:, Training?
,Squidward:, For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.
,Patrick:, Sunday?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!
,Squidward:, No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt. ,[Gary is shown looking like a hillbilly with a chimney in his shell],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, you got that right. Gary's no... ,[scowls], hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race? ,[Squidward shows the certificate again],
,Squidward:, Papers. ,[Patrick walks up and reads it],
,Patrick:, Hmmm. 'Property of Squidward... Tentpoles.'
,Squidward:, That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
,Patrick:, No!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
,Patrick:, Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward! ,[Patrick runs off],
,SpongeBob:, Are you thinking what I'm thinking? ,[Gary imagines himself watching TV], No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail! ,[SpongeBob runs off. He then returns, wearing a coach's outfit], Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies! ,[laughs], I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use. ,[scene cuts to Sandy walking down the street],
,Sandy:, Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob opening a can],
,SpongeBob:, Kelp powder for muscle mass. ,[drops the food in a blender as Gary looks on with disgust], Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché. ,[drops the eggs in the blender], And nails for toughness. ,[drops the nails in the blender. Turns on the blender],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Of course, I expect you to eat this. ,[Gary's eyes widen. SpongeBob pours some of the blended food into a glass], It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary? ,[Gary is already out of the room through his snail door. SpongeBob stops his stopwatch], Wow, pretty good time.
,Patrick:, ,[holding a rock], Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, your snail is a rock.
,Patrick:, Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, the competition's getting tough. ,[walks over to Gary watching TV], That's it, Gary. ,[takes out a leash], We are going to start some serious training right now.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[puts the leash on Gary. Gary tries to stretch his eyes to watching the TV as long as he can before he's pulled out of the room], Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints. ,[holds up a stopwatch], On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary! ,[SpongeBob notices Gary is not there], Gary? ,[SpongeBob walks up to Gary, who is watching more TV], Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.
,Squidward:, ,[pops his head in SpongeBob's lower window], Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.
,Patrick:, ,[pops his head in SpongeBob's upper window], Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail. ,[shows his rock],
,Squidward:, Patrick, that's a rock.
,Patrick:, Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.
,Squidward:, What are you standing on, anyway? ,[scene shows Patrick is standing on Squidward's back], Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow. ,[Squidward walks off as Patrick falls to the ground. Patrick pops his head in the lower window],
,Patrick:, My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do. ,[picks up Gary and walks off],
,Patrick:, You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Gary outside],
,SpongeBob:, Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob blowing on a whistle], Come on, Gary, move it! ,[scene cuts to Gary crawling up and down a wall], Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down! ,[scene cuts to Gary punching a punching bag with his eyes], Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go! ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob following Gary on his bike], Come on, push it, Gary, push it! ,[scene cuts to Gary on the toilet], Move that shell! ,[scene cuts to Gary in the bathtub with SpongeBob looking through the curtains], Come on, Gary, move it! ,[scene cuts to Gary eating], Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster! ,[scene cuts to nighttime. Gary is on an exercise wheel while SpongeBob is sleeping but giving orders at the same time], Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it... ,[scene cuts to morning, where Gary is tired, out of breath, and on a leash], Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke. ,[Gary is pulling SpongeBob in a wagon], Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race! ,[scene cuts to an announcer],
,Nat:, Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.
,Perch Perkins:, Hey, what are you doing?! ,[Nat runs away as the announcer comes and sits down], Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony. ,[scene cuts to a large fish standing by a microphone],
,Mayor:, And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano! ,[crowd cheers as the band plays. Larry comes crawling out every so slowly with a flame attached on his back],
,Perch Perkins:, Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts... ,[crowd is cheering], ...for Larry. ,[Larry is still crawling to the torch], He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.
,Narrator:, Two hours later... ,[band is not playing as loud],
,Perch Perkins:, He's almost a quarter of the way there. ,[As Larry is still crawling up to the torch, one of the band members faints after playing for 2 hours. The mayor checks his watch, then runs over, grabs Larry and lights the torch],
,Mayor:, The torch is lit! Let the race begin. ,[the crowd cheers. Cut to the playing field, where SpongeBob and Squidward are standing at the starting line. The snails have markers: Snellie is #6, a very worn out Gary is #7, and Rocky is #8],
,Squidward:, Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life. ,[Gary is coughing],
,Squidward:, I'll alert the paramedics.
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], Good one, Squidward.
,Official:, ,[walks up to the contestants], You guys ready?
,Patrick:, ,[screams], A burglar!
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, that's the official.
,Official:, We're ready to start here, folks.
,Squidward:, Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.
,Snellie:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.
,Gary:, Meow.
,Patrick:, This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here. ,[official raises the flag],
,Official:, On your mark. Get set. ,[lowers the flag], Slither! ,[Snellie runs out first],
,Perch Perkins:, And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!
,SpongeBob:, What! ,[runs over to Gary],
,Squidward:, Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!
,SpongeBob:, What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!
,Patrick:, It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.
,SpongeBob:, Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now! ,[gross close-up on Gary], Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary! ,[SpongeBob jumps up and down while Gary is moving slowly], Go, go, go, go, go!
,Perch Perkins:, And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.
,SpongeBob:, Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster! ,[Gary tries to go faster],
,Perch Perkins:, I do not like the look of this.
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?! ,[Gary eyes are now really small],
,Perch Perkins:, That coach is pushing that snail too hard!
,SpongeBob:, Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster! ,[Gary's left eye explodes], Huh? ,[crowd gasps],
,Perch Perkins:, Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout! ,[Gary's other eye explodes], Oops, make that two, folks.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Gary? ,[Gary's shell breaks, showing a machine inside],
,Perch Perkins:, Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[getting worried], Umm, Gary, you can stop now! ,[Gary is leaving skid marks on the track],
,Perch Perkins:, He's losing control! ,[Gary is running into the walls, making a bunch of sparks],
,SpongeBob:, You can take a break now if you want to, Gary. ,[Gary is spinning on the track],
,Perch Perkins:, He's spinning out of control! ,[crowd gasps], He's heading straight for the wall! ,[Gary runs into a wall of tires and explodes. The crowd gasps again, then they cheer],
,SpongeBob:, No! ,[two firemen come up and extinguish the smoke. Squidward laughs], Hold on, Gary, I'm coming! ,[runs onto the track],
,Perch Perkins:, Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen. ,[Snellie is coming up on the finish line],
,Squidward:, Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up to Gary, crying], Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You did? ,[cries more], Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You did? ,[cries some more], Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!
,Snellie:, Meow. ,[Snellie turns around and heads straight to Gary to help him],
,Squidward:, What?! ,[Gary notices Snellie racing towards him and he is back to normal now],
,SpongeBob:, Gary? ,[Gary and Snellie start purring at each other], Oh!
,Crowd:, Aww!
,Perch Perkins:, ,[laughs], My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary. ,[Squidward walks up to where the snails are at],
,SpongeBob:, Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?
,Squidward:, But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then... ,[Rocky is at the finish line],
,Announcer:, And the winner is Rocky! ,[Patrick cries, the crowd goes wild and Gary and Snellie crawl away],
,Squidward:, I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock. ,[Patrick walks over with the trophy he won],
,Patrick:, Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.
,Squidward:, Gosh, Patrick, thanks. ,[reads the engraving], The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward... ,[we see the engraving and the camera zooms in on Squidward's misspelled last name], ...,Tortellini?!, Will I ever win? ,[he, SpongeBob, and Patrick laugh. Sandy comes on-screen and kicks SpongeBob in the air. He and Patrick stop laughing],
,Sandy:, ,[angrily], ,That's for yesterday, SquarePants!,

"[The episode begins with Patrick running to the Krusty Krab. He trips and falls on his face. He gets up and walks inside the restaurant until he is grabbed by Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, hold on a second there, free-loader! What are you doing here?
,Patrick:, I'm here for lunch.
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you bring money this time?
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick holds out a couple of dollar bills.], Yes! ,[Mr. Krabs eyes start to bark like dogs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me see that. ,[Mr. Krabs takes the money and sniffs them. Then he rubs them on his tongue and teeth a few times. Then he licks them, then he eats them, swallows them and spits them out.], Alright. Pay is real. Now get in line!
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick takes the money.], Yes, sir! ,[He walks up to the line where business people are waiting. Some of them are executives.],
,Bill:, Hey, how's that new executive treatment sandwich treating you? Cause it's hitting all the quadrants of my hunger markets.
,Patrick:, ,[Listening to the conversation], Mmm, quadrants!
,Bill:, You know, it reminds me of something I was thinking about business the other day.
,Harold:, The satisfaction earnings of the fourth quarter of my lunch are off the charts! ,[The two executives laugh],
,Bill:, And I love the way it tastes! ,[They continue laughing],
,Yellow Executive:, And business, my friend, is the business I'm talking about.
,Marv:, Well, one can't have business without business right?
,Yellow Executive:, Interesting point, Marv. How's your sandwich?
,Marv:, Absolutely spectacular! This new menu item is the business plan I can really get behind!
,Executive:, I tell you, this is one dynamic little sandwich.
,Shubie:, With levels of proactiveness that are off the charts. Business wise.
,Executive:, It really appeals to my demographic.
,Shubie:, Well, you are an executive in a fast-paced world of business.
,Executive:, Ha, ha! That's for sure!
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick walks to the register.], These guys talk funny words.
,Squidward:, Oh, yeah. They're a riot. What can I get ya?
,Patrick:, I guess I'll have one of these business sandwiches everybody's talking about.
,Squidward:, Ah, the executive treatment.
,Patrick:, Is that what you call it?
,Squidward:, Well, that's what Mr. Krabs makes me call it. It's really just a Krabby Patty that costs more. And SpongeBob wears a different tie when he makes it.
,Patrick:, Oh, wow! I'll take seven!
,Squidward:, Oh, I'm sorry, sir. The executive treatment is available to executives only. I'm not sorry.
,Patrick:, But I never wanted anything so much in my whole life! Since this morning when I wanted a donut-night at the ""Donut"" and it was great! The donut is gone! ,[Patrick shakes Squidward.], The donut is gone!
,Squidward:, ,[Squidward pushes Patrick's hands away.], First of all, a lot of that donut, it's still on your face! ,[Patrick has half a donut on his face and licks it off.],
,Patrick:, Now, where's my executive treatment?
,Squidward:, I told you, it's for executives only! And you aren't even dressed like an executive! I could of course sell you ,[Squidward pulls out a tie], the official Krusty Krab business tie for only 10 dollars.
,Patrick:, Will the tie let me order the executive treatment?
,Squidward:, Not on its own, no. But you could Krabby-size the tie with and get a pair of ,[Squidward pulls out some glasses], business glasses for additional 10 dollars.
,Patrick:, ,[Laughs], Well, I'd be stupid not to!
,Squidward:, Well, you're half right.
,Patrick:, Here's your 20 bucks. ,[Patrick gives Squidward 20 dollars.],
,Squidward:, Here's your glasses. ,[Patrick puts on the tie and glasses.],
,Patrick:, Thanks! I'll take one executive treatment my good man. ,[SpongeBob pops out of the window with the executive treatment sandwich.],
,SpongeBob:, Here's your executive treatment!
,Squidward:, ,[Squidward takes the sandwich off SpongeBob and gives Patrick the sandwich.], Here you go.
,Patrick:, Oh man! ,[whispers], It looks executively delicious! ,[As he goes to eat the sandwich, Marv runs up and grabs Patrick.],
,Marv:, Carl, what are you doing standing around at a time like this? We're gonna be late for the big brainstorming meeting! ,[Executives appear behind Patrick and start to push him out of the restaurant.],
,Patrick:, But! But! ,[Patrick gets shoved out of the door.], Save my sandwich for me, Squidward! Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[snickers], I'll save it alright. I'll just put it here in the circular files. ,[Opens a trashcan and attempts to throw the sandwich away],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Pops out of the trashcan], What are you doing throwing away a perfectly sellable sandwich?!
,[The executives continue to push Patrick through the streets of Bikini Bottom until they reach a building called the business industries.],
,Patrick:, No! ,[The executives push Patrick through the doors which makes him lose his hands. The executives punch in their tickets in the punch in/out clock. Patrick puts his hand in the clock and his hand turns into a ticket. The executives push Patrick into the elevator.], No! ,[The elevator closes and everything is quiet. Patrick is settled as the music is played. The elevator takes them to the 115th floor of the building. The executives push Patrick out of the elevator.], No! ,[They stop at a door to the conference room with the address code 4-B on it.], Not 4-B! No!
,Marv:, Wow! You're very upset about conference room 4-B. And I can't say I blame you. Because conference room 4-B is the most terrifying conference room in the whole building. More people have been fired in here than all the other conference rooms combined! ,[Patrick screams], Save it for the big brainstorming meeting! ,[Marv opens the doors], Right here is where all the biggest business decisions in the business are made. Why if an impostor were to be caught in here, hmm...
,Patrick:, He'd be given a sandwich and sent on his way?
,Marv:, No, he'd be convicted as a corporate spy and sent to jail forever and ever and ever. Hey, where are you going?
,Patrick:, I think I’ve forgot to water my manatee I'll just--? ,[Patrick goes to open the doors and leave, but was quickly opened and slammed into by a tall green eel with a business outfit on.],
,Stockholder Eel:, Gentlemen, please. ,[The doors close and Patrick slides off the wall.],
,Patrick:, ,[dazed], Where am I?
,Stockholder Eel:, Exactly. I like you, young man. Everybody scoot down and so he can sit next to me. And I won't intimidate him at all by my terrifyingly largeness and proximity. As this junior executive so eloquently put it, “Where exactly are we?”
,Marv:, Ah, sir, if you take a look at this ,[Marv shows a line chart on the easel.], I believe you'll agree that we’re perfectly positioned for our marketing to be number one across the business sector. ,[The executives murmur in agreement.],
,Stockholder Eel:, I need a straight answer, not a bunch of meaningless charts! What do you give a disappointed stockholder to make him feel better? ,[The stockholder eel looks at Patrick.],
,Patrick:, A sandwich? ,[The stockholder eel looks at the executives. The executives laugh.],
,Harold:, Get a load of this guy! A sandwich!
,Marv:, This guy has sandwiches on the brain!
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick’s head is shaped like a sandwich], No I don't! ,[The executives continue to laugh],
,Tom:, That's just about the silliest piece of idea!
,Stockholder Eel:, Alright, hold it! Now all of you just hold it right there! It's easy to laugh and judge and heap a man with scholar when you hear an idea that stands out because it's so unusual. ,[The executives mope.], So, everybody, just stop and think for a minute about what your colleague is really trying to say because I want to be the one to tell him, ""That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard.""
,Patrick:, What if I had a meaningless chart?
,Stockholder Eel:, Yes, maybe I was too hasty about that. ,[Patrick draws a picture of himself holding a sandwich on the easel.], Well, you're definitely giving a new meaning to the word “meaningless”.
,Patrick:, Oh, wait! ,[Patrick draws a sun with a happy face on the easel. Then he draws a house.], And here's a little house with smoke coming out of the chimney. See what I mean? ,[The stockholder eel growls and becomes angry.], I guess he likes my chart, 'cause he's smiling.
,Marv:, He smiles like that when he's really angry. ,[The executives murmur in concern.],
,Patrick:, Do you slap your palms down on the table like that too?
,Stockholder Eel:, ,[growls], Yes.
,Patrick:, Oh.
,Stockholder Eel:, I don't know who you are, but you better not be an impostor. Do you know what happens to impostors in conference room 4-B?
,Patrick:, Well, uh, let's see. Uh, don't tell me! I-I know it's not sandwiches. They don't get sandwiches. Do they?
,Stockholder Eel:, ,[The stockholder eel slaps his head in disgust. He holds out a drinking straw.], Mister, this is the last straw! ,[The executives hold out their cups and sigh at the fact that they’ve run out of straws.], Now, I'm just going to give you just 18 more chances to prove yourself.
,Narrator:, Montage. ,[Patrick is seen writing on the board while trying to solve an equation. He draws a picture of a sandwich as an answer. The stockholder eel gets really angry and rips his mustache off his face in frustration. The executives gasps.],
,Stockholder Eel:, Jenkins!
,Jenkins:, Yes, sir?
,Stockholder Eel:, Mustache. ,[Jenkins rips his mustache off his face.],
,Jenkins:, Here you are sir. ,[Jenkins sheds a tear as he hands his mustache to the stockholder eel. The stockholder eel takes the mustache and puts it on his face.],
,[The scene changes to Patrick and Marv stamping ""No"" signs on different papers. Patrick stamps on Marv’s head and Marv stamps him back. Soon, they ended up stamping each other, much to the stockholder eel’s disgust. Marv stamps “Void” on Patrick’s forehead. Officer John and Officer Rob come in and randomly hit Marv, forcing him to leave the building. The scene changes to Patrick baking a pie in the oven. He puts the pie on a copy machine causing it to splat, he makes a copy with a purple pie chart on it. He shows it to the stockholder eel, but he splatters it on Patrick’s face. The paper slides off and Patrick licks the pie goop off his face while the stockholder eel walks away. The next scene shows Harold filling up a mug with water from the drinking fountain. He puts the mug on the table and gives Patrick a thumbs up and he’s ready to dive. Patrick jumps off the diving board and lands in the mug. The stockholder eel takes the mug off of Patrick’s head and walks away drinking out of it. Patrick sits there with his head shaped like a mug. The scene changes to Patrick and the stockholder eel in conference room 4-B at the top floor of the building.],
,Patrick:, ,[holding a book containing his official report], And so in conclusion, I would like to submit my official report. ,[Patrick gives the stockholder eel his official report. As the stockholder eel goes to read it, it turns out that Patrick made paper-dolls out of his report.],
,Stockholder Eel:, You know, kid. We need somebody like you around here.
,Patrick:, You do? ,[The stockholder eel, finally fed up with Patrick’s stupidity, whacks his official report off the table.],
,Stockholder Eel:, For me to fire!
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve got a surprise for you. ,[Patrick takes off his glasses and tie. The executives gasp.], You can't fire me! I'm not an executive at all! I'm just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead! Send me away forever as a corporate spy if you want to! But not before I've had my say! ,[Just as Patrick is about to finish, Officers John and Rob show up and whack him a couple times. The scene changes to Bikini Bottom Jail where Patrick is ironing his heavy chain ball with the other prisoners. Officer Rob comes in.],
,Officer Rob:, You have a visitor. ,[Officer Rob takes Patrick to the meeting room where SpongeBob is waiting.],
,Patrick:, Who is it?
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I heard you're in charge of the laundry room on Thursdays. That's nice.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Well, it's pretty nice I guess.
,SpongeBob:, You know what that makes you?
,Patrick:, Nuh-uh.
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds out a Krabby Patty], An executive!
,Patrick:, Oh, wait! Oh, is that what I think it is?!
,SpongeBob:, Uh-huh! An executive treatment! ,[SpongeBob shoves the sandwich through the telephone and Patrick eats it. Patrick and SpongeBob stare at each other for a few moments. Patrick tears off his jail clothes and puts his glasses and tie back on.],
,Officer Rob:, ,[gasps], What happened to prisoner 665321? ,[Rob pushes the alarm button. Patrick leaves the meeting room as officers run all over the place.],
,Patrick:, Let's go home, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, but who are you? ,[Patrick and SpongeBob laugh as they both leave Bikini Bottom Jail during the lockdown. They stop at the gate.], No seriously. Who are you?

"[Episode opens on a shot of the Chum Bucket. The camera then cuts to interior of Plankton's lab. Karen is attached to the wall in this episode. The camera zooms in on a small entrance with a button, outlet, and miniature coat hanger by it. The panel covering the entrance slides up, revealing an exhausted Plankton wearing a hat and carrying a briefcase. He enters the Chum Bucket and the panel automatically closes],
,Plankton:, ,[sighs. Plankton walks over to the coat hanger, about to hang his hat],
,Karen:, ,[speaking right when Plankton grabs his hat, causing him to grow frustrated], Plankton, is that you? Welcome home, honey.
,Plankton:, ,[mutters to himself as he hangs up his hat and puts down his briefcase. When Plankton removes his hat, a green odor is shown to be coming from him. It begins approaching three holes in the ceiling right above Karen's monitor],
,Karen:, How was your day? ,[smells the odor through the holes in the ceiling and coughs as an alarm sounds], Dear Neptune, Plankton! ,[closes the holes in the ceiling], What is that smell?!
,Plankton:, The aroma you speak of, Karen, my computer wife, is the stench of failure!
,[The word ""failure"" comes out of Plankton, along with the continuous odor],
,Stench:, ,[in a whispering tone], Failure...
,Plankton:, And now, the smell of defeat so deeply penetrates my soul that my very skin is permeated with its foul stench. ,[sighs and starts walking away, then pauses and speaks in a sarcastic tone], Thanks for asking. ,[starts walking away again], 
,Karen:, Well, it smells horrible! You're not coming in here smelling like that! ,[grabs Plankton with one of her robotic arms],
,Plankton:, Hey! What are you—?
,[Karen holds Plankton up to an air duct which vacuums off his skin, leaving him looking like he normally does, except his color is pink and he's in his underwear. Plankton looks at himself and, seeing he's naked, screams an unusually high-pitched scream and covers himself. Karen begins moving Plankton somewhere else],
,Plankton:, Stop that at once! You—!
,[Karen puts Plankton into a bucket of water which rests next to a mop, creating a large splash and several bubbles. She takes him out],
,Plankton:, ,[gasps for water], I command you to—!
,[Plankton's words are made incomprehensible when Karen puts him back in the bucket a second time. She takes Plankton out again and, with another robotic arm of hers, holds up a scrub brush],
,Plankton:, ,[moves his legs around like he's trying to run away], Oh no!
,[Karen scrubs Plankton with the brush and puts him in the bucket of water a third time. When she takes him out once again, she blows a hair dryer at Plankton while he screams. She grabs a new pair of skin for Plankton which is on a rack among other pairs and puts it on him while he sits on a stool. Karen holds up a mirror for Plankton and buffs him up with pink powder, creating a large cloud of dust which blocks the view of the camera. When the dust clears, Plankton is clean and has a SpongeBob-like look on his face],
,Karen:, There you go. Now don't you feel better?
,Plankton:, ,[looking in the mirror], Although, I do look ravishing, it's not enough to mask the ugliness I feel inside!
,Karen:, Did I miss a spot? ,[scrubs the inside of his mouth with the scrub brush. Plankton is very frustrated now, and begins to grow veins on himself],
,Karen:, Don't blow a gasket, dear. Today's a special day!
,Plankton:, ,[as his veins disappear], Special day?
,Karen:, Yes. We're celebrating your biggest accomplishment ever!
,Plankton:, ,[smiling now], Really? I accomplished something? What is it?
,Karen:, It has something with you asking a certain someone to spend the rest of her life with you.
,Plankton:, ,[confused], What?
,[Cut to shot of just Karen],
,Karen:, ,[sighs a quick sigh and, while showing a gold ring on her robotic hand, speaks a little faster], We each wear rings in memory of this moment.
,[Cut to shot of Plankton looking at a gold ring that he's wearing around his arm],
,Plankton:, ,[moves his arm behind his back and back in front of him, making the ring disappear], Enough with the riddles, woman! Just tell me what this proud moment in my life is!
,Karen:, Oh, you selfish, green twit! It's our wedding anniversary!
,Plankton:, ,[disappointed], Oh, that. ,[sarcastically rolls around an imaginary noise maker with his finger], Yippee. ,[walks away],
,Karen:, ,[sobbing], You forgot! And I got you the perfect gift! ,[holds out a bottle with a piece of paper and a pink bow tied around it inside],
,Plankton:, ,[screeches to a halt and turns around, seeing his gift], The Krabby Patty formula!? ,[immediately perks up, jumps up onto the bottle and gives it two kisses], How did you get it!?
,Karen:, First I went to the Krusty Krab...
,[Camera cuts to a shot of the ordering area of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is in the boat. Karen, who is for some reason portable now, rolls on her wheels in front of it.],
,Karen:, ,[in flashback], One Krabby Patty, please.
,[Squidward holds out a plate with a Krabby Patty on it and Karen picks it up. She pushes what she can of it into a slot on the side of her. Displayed on her screen are the words ""Secret Formula"" and a picture of Krabby Patty. She sucks in the rest of the Krabby Patty, prints out a piece of paper with the formula on it, and puts it in a bottle],
,Karen:, ,[in flashback], Thank you. ,[rolls away],
,Squidward:, ,[in flashback], Whatever.
,[The camera fades back to Plankton still kissing the bottle with the formula in it],
,Plankton:, What??? Sorry. I wasn't listening. ,[jumps down holding the formula], Well, you can tell me later. ,[begins to walk away with it],
,Karen:, ,[as she takes away the bottle with the formula in it to Plankton], You're not getting this until you get me a gift.
,Plankton:, ,[groans],
,Karen:, From your heart.
,[Plankton sighs and walks away to the entrance seen in the beginning of the episode. The door automatically opens, thus making its placement seem rather pointless. He grabs his hat from the coat hanger, gives Karen one last look, and leaves the Chum Bucket. Bubble into a shot of SpongeBob and Squidward walking together],
,SpongeBob:, And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat. ,[Changes expression as if he notices something],
,Squidward:, That story gets better every time you tell it, SpongeBo—
,SpongeBob:, ,[lifting his hands up and knocking Squidward to the ground], Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like...
,[Plankton groans],
,SpongeBob:, ...despair.
,Squidward:, That was probably me.
,SpongeBob:, No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over... ,[turns around and points], this way. ,[goes down on the ground and sniffs like a dog, finding Plankton groaning], Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton?
,Plankton:, Wha—? SpongeBob?? Ahh...there's nothing wrong. Don't worry. ,[crying], I'm...fine.

,SpongeBob:, ,[camera zooms in on SpongeBobs house. The scene changes to SpongeBob's Libary], So what's your favorite thing for you and, Karen to do together?
,Plankton:, Well we like to take long walks on the beach, and, uh, we like to talk about our dreams. Our dreams of conquering all of Bikini Bottom and become supreme overlords of all creation... ,[Plankton starts stomping his feet], ...and to trample our enemies beneath our feet. ,[Evil laugh],
,SpongeBob:, ,[as he is writing it down of a notepad], Trampling enemies... ,[talks back to Plankton], Now tell me about Karen.
,Plankton:, Well, she's a Mark-2 Surplus Unevec with 256 Gigs of RAM and uh, and there's the cutest little mole on her CPU, and the way she processes data... Eh-eh oooh mama!
,SpongeBob:, Does she have any hobbies?
,Plankton:, Uhh... well, uhh ,[plankton scratches his head], she does make a lot of beeping sounds.
,SpongeBob:, Interesting, does she ever go ""Ding!""
,Plankton:, Now that you mention it she does go ding, at least once a day.

,[SpongeBob and Sandy sneak into the Dutchman's ship through an open window. Sandy throws a lasso and ties it up to the ceiling. SpongeBob and Sandy climb up while the Flying Dutchman continues to admire himself in the mirror.],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[forms a more hideous face], Forty percent chance of rain tonight as we head into the weekend. ,[shakes his head and laughs],
,[SpongeBob and Sandy tip-toe quietly above the Flying Dutchman. They lower themselves down to where the Dutchman is having dandruff. Sandy brushes the dandruff into SpongeBob's bucket with her tail.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], Got it!
,[SpongeBob and Sandy quickly climb back up and quietly leave. Plankton sneaks into through the hole on the floor. He throws the grappling hook and climbs up the Dutchman's back. He takes out a little vacuum and goes to suck the dandruff. But the vacuum accidentally sucks up the Dutchman's hair and it pulls really hard, causing the Flying Dutchman to feel pain.],
,Flying Dutchman:, Ah! Ow! Uh! What the?! ,[sees Plankton and grabs him], How dare you steal my dandruff! I've been drying me scalp for centuries in order to achieve the perfect dermatitis flakes! ,[points to his scalp with dry flakes on it],
,Plankton:, ,[hold up dandruff shampoo], Maybe some skull and shoulders would help?
,[The Flying Dutchman growls angrily and blasts Plankton out of his ship with his powers. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Sandy flying over Jellyfish Fields with all of the items they've obtained from the list. Sandy is brushing the dandruff off her tail.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, we got everything on the list. ,[pulls up the bag of ingredients and spins the seat], Oh, Mr. Krabs will be so proud of me!
,Sandy:, I hope so, because that's the craziest group of ingredients I ever—Whoa!
,[Suddenly, the alarm blares and the submarine shakes. It appears that Plankton is having the Chum Bucket plunge SpongeBob and Sandy out of the submarine. Plankton pops out.],
,Plankton:, There is one more thing I needed to get on my shopping list. Everything! ,[cackles], Thanks for doing it for me! So long, chumps!
,[The Chum Bucket flings SpongeBob and Sandy away, grabs the submarine, takes it inside and pulls out the bag of ingredients.],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs evilly], At last! The Krabby Patty secret ingredients are in my hands!
,[SpongeBob and Sandy land in a bush.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw, my ingredients!
,Sandy:, ,[cries], My submarine!
,Yeti Crab:, ,[appears next to them and growls], My hair!
,[SpongeBob and Sandy scream in terror.],
,French Narrator:, Later…
,[The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab. The yeti crab walks to the restaurant with a brown wig. He lets SpongeBob and Sandy off his back.],
,Yeti Crab:, Thanks for the wig.
,Sandy:, No problem! ,[sighs as she sees her tail completely shaved off], It'll grow back.
,[The yeti crab turns and leaves.],
,SpongeBob:, And you even had enough to cover his buns. ,[points to the yeti crab's butt all covered up with Sandy's fur],
,[Mr. Krabs is bathing in a tub of money in the restaurant. SpongeBob and Sandy enter the restaurant and sulk over to Mr. Krabs.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs! ,[Mr. Krabs gasps and hides in the tub], I got all the secret ingredients on your list, but Plankton stole them all! I made the apocalypse!
,[SpongeBob cries a fountain of tears and spray them all over the restaurant, which hits Mr. Krabs. Sandy gets drenched on by the tears and activates the windshield wipers on her helmet.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[plugs SpongeBob's mouth with a cork], Now, now, son. You didn't make the apocalypse. I couldn't afford to have Plankton following me while I was getting the real ingredients at the Barg'N-Mart, could I?
,[Mr. Krabs pushes the button on the table Fred is eating on and it flips over showing a shopping cart containing the real Krabby Patty ingredients.],
,Fred:, ,[screams], My leg!
,SpongeBob:, So, my list was a fake? So, no apocalypse?
,Mr. Krabs:, No apocalypse.
,SpongeBob:, I saved the world! ,[laughs and dances around the restaurant while Sandy glares angrily at Mr. Krabs], No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse!
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's not go too far.
,Sandy:, ,[rolls up her sleeves], You mean you sent my best friend on a dangerous wild goose chase just so you could go shopping?! ,[backs Mr. Krabs into his office], Excuse us, SpongeBob. ,[closes the door while wearing her karate glove], This is for my tail!
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait, Sandy, I was—
,Sandy:, Hi-yah! ,[karate chops Mr. Krabs really hard], This is for almost getting us killed!
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait, Sandy!
,Sandy:, Hi-yah! ,[karate chops Mr. Krabs really hard again and comes out with a bag of money], And this is for my submarine, Matilda!
,[Mr. Krabs come out and is completely beaten up.],
,Sandy:, ,[kicks the plank Mr. Krabs is standing on], Hi-yah! Hi-yah! ,[karate chops Mr. Krabs and sends him flying through the roof],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I guess I had that coming.
,[Meanwhile, at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is fixing up a batch of Krabby Patties with the fake ingredients.],
,Plankton:, Can you believe it, Karen? After all these years, the secret ingredients are finally here! And the final ingredient: ,[pulls out a bucket of ghost dandruff from the bag], ghost dandruff!
,Karen:, ,[backs away], I wouldn't add that last one.
,Plankton:, ,[adds ghost dandruff to the batch], Ha, ha! I can't wait to see the look on Krabs' face!
,[Plankton stirs the fake ingredients all together. Then all of a sudden, the Chum Bucket explodes and sends Plankton flying in the sky.],
,Plankton:, ,[screams until he sees Mr. Krabs], Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton.

"[episode starts at the Krusty Krab at night],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Flips sign from ""open"" to ""closed], Good night, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Closing time already?
,SpongeBob:, I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, have a good night, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?
,Mr. Krabs:, I thought those things ate mostly kibble.
,SpongeBob:, It's a special treat. Just to get him ready for tomorrow...
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! Right! Okay, that makes- Wait, what's tomorrow?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mr. Krabs, did you forget?
,Mr. Krabs:, Probably.
,SpongeBob:, Tomorrow is ""Bring Your Pet To Work"" day!
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't need a special day for that. Squidward's here every day!
,Squidward:, ,[Stood in the doorway], Nice. ,[Walks away], REAL NICE!
,SpongeBob:, Umm... Can I buy that patty?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah. Sure.
,SpongeBob:, Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, SpongeBob! I almost forgot. The price is double for pets because they're so special.
,SpongeBob:, Good idea! ,[Gives Mr. Krabs some change], Thanks again, Mr. Krabs! ,[Leaves, then pops out of no where], Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:,  Whoa, what?
,SpongeBob:, ,[speaking gibberish],
,Mr. Krabs:, What, what?!
,SpongeBob:, We're all out of Krabby Patties!
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you check the freezer?!
,SpongeBob:, I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!
,Mr. Krabs:, What about the freezer in the attic?
,SpongeBob:, We don't have an attic.
,Mr. Krabs:, No attic?!
,SpongeBob:, You sold it, remember?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yeah.
,[Plankton and Karen are spying on Krabs and SpongeBob from the Chum Bucket with a telescope],
,Plankton:, Now what are they saying Karen? Karen?!
,Karen:, I have no idea.
,Plankton:, What? I thought you said you could read lips!
,Karen:, I can, but you took my telescope away!
,[Plankton gives the telescope to Karen],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[In the telescope], Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
,SpongeBob:, A fresh batch?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
,Plankton:, Okay, now what's he saying?
,Karen:, He said they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
,Plankton:, A fresh batch of—ooh, this is good. This is really good!
,SpongeBob:, When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, What?
,Plankton:, Okay, what'd he just say?
,Karen:, What?
,Plankton:, I said, ""What'd he just say?""
,Karen:, He said, ""What?""
,Plankton:, I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!
,Karen:, I know that, and I'm saying he said, ""What?""!
,Plankton:, I know that! Wait... oh, he said, ""What?"".
,Karen:, Yes!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen. I think we might just want to reschedule ""Bring Your Pet To Work"" day.
,SpongeBob:, No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, okay. But make sure he's healthy and clean!
,Plankton:, Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!
,[Bubbles change the scene showing SpongeBob's House],
,SpongeBob:, Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!
,Gary:, Mow.
,SpongeBob:, There you are, Gare-bear. I brought you some kelp fries. ,[Holds a bag and shakes it upside down. A plate of kelp fries falls out and Gary sniffs them], I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready, while you enjoy them. ,[Gary gets scared and runs away while SpongeBob fills the bath tub], Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary? ,[Eats a kelp fry], Gary? ,[Walks in the kitchen,] Gary?! ,[He sees Gary hiding under the counter], Gary, not again come out of there, it's dirty! ,[Grabs Gary], Gotcha! Come on, Gary, quit messing arou.... ,[Tries to pull him out but accidentally trips and Gary flies into a pot on top of the refrigerator and is covered in mud],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Upset], Great, Gary, just great! Now you need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not going to come down from there, are you?
,Gary:, Meow. ,[No],
,SpongeBob:, Ugh! You win, we'll bathe you in the morning! ,[Flicks off the light and leaves.. Bubbles change the scene. Gary hears a knock on the door and comes to answer it],
,Plankton:, ,[In a disguise wearing a wig and has a suitcase], Good morning, sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...
,SpongeBob:, ,[Off screen], Gary! I'm going to start the bath!
,Plankton:, Look I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?
,Gary:, Meow.
,Plankton:, Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here!,[Opens suitcase and a large poster pops out], At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself this could be...
,SpongeBob:, ,[off screen], Gary! The bath is ready!
,Plankton:, ...all yours! Now I know what your thinking, but I got you covered! ,[Shows Gary an orange inflatable shell], A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge of course.
,SpongeBob:, ,[off screen], Gary! Your bath is ready!
,[Gary immediately puts on the shell and leaves],
,Plankton:, Have a pleasant stay! Bon Voyage! ,[Closes the door and takes off the disguise, goes into Gary's real shell, and puts small balls on his antennas, making him look like Gary. He laughs], If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula, and destroy Krabs once and for all!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Appears walking next to Plankton in the shell and mistakes him for Gary], Ah-ha there you are Gare-Bear! ,[Picks him up and walks up the stairs], Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for ""Bring your pet to work” day! And today is the day! ,[Goes to the bath tub and drops ""Gary"" in the tub],  First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!
,Plankton:, Wha...? ,[Gets squirted with the gel and is covered in shampoo],
,SpongeBob:, Ahhh, smells nice, doesn't it?
,Plankton:, Ugh...
,SpongeBob:, ,[Takes ""Gary"" and holds him above his head], Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime! ,[Scrubs Plankton by dragging him back and forth like a sponge],
,Plankton:, ,[screams],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Stops scrubbing him], Bet that feel good, huh?
,Plankton:, ,[Coughs and Chokes], Curses! I mean... meow?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Nervous], Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?
,Plankton:, I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow! ,[Soap washes off and reveals his body to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Worried], Gary! You're turning green! And talking!
,Plankton:, No, I'm not.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Rushes down the stairs holding ""Gary""], We gotta get you to the pet hospital!
,Plankton:, Pet hospital! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Gary! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late! Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick. ,[Bubbles change the scene showing the hospital. To Sadie], Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and he's turning green. Is he sick?
,[Sadie takes a look at ""Gary""],
,Plankton:, ,[Afraid she might notice it's him], Meow? ,[Sadie throws bottles of medicine on the ceiling while shrieking in horror],
,SpongeBob:, Is that yes? Or no?
,Sadie:, I have never seen such a drastic case! Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!
,Plankton:, Intensive care unit?
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Gary. These are proffesionals.
,[Bubbles change the scene and Plankton is sitting on a bed],
,Plankton:, ,[Sees a large computer, thinking it's Karen], Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
,Sadie:, ,[Walks in the room], Don't worry. I'm just going to subject you to a series of invasive tests. It'll be over before you know it. ,[She pulls a curtains and we hear Plankton screaming in pain while the screen shows the hospital. SpongeBob breathes heavily thinking about ""Gary""],
,Jennifer-Millie:, Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit and we just need to run a couple more tests.
,Purple Doctorfish:, ,[To Jennifer], That's not what I'm saying at all.
,SpongeBob:,  Oh, Gary! ,[crying],
,Purple Doctorfish:, ,[To SpongeBob], Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can, we just can't find out anything wrong with him! I've never seen anything like it.
,SpongeBob:, Please try to save him, doctor!
,[Cut to Plankton],
,Plankton:, ,[Sleeps on the bed, then wakes up paranoid], No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I...
,Sadie:, Relax, Gary, the tests are over. I'm just here to give you a little pill.
,Plankton:, Whew! That's a relief.
,Sadie:, ,[Takes out a giant pill bigger than Plankton], Open wide. ,[Plankton screams as Sadie puts the pill in his mouth],
,Sadie:, That wasn't so bad, was it? ,[Plankton has the pill in his mouth, tears up, and spits out the pill all over her], That's not good... ,[Cuts to SpongeBob still crying], Uh, Mr. SquarePants?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stops crying and heads over to ""Gary"" who is covered up in bandages], Gary!
,Sadie:, The doctor says there's nothing more we can do. It's best to take him home and let nature take its course.
,SpongeBob:, You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh... ,[Sadie walks away], Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...,[sniff],... the end. ,[wails],
,Plankton:, If I could just have a... ,[cough cough], Krabby Patty before I go...
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, little buddy, sure. ,[sniffs], Y'know, it's really poignant.
,Plankton:, What is?
,SpongeBob:, Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you! ,[continues wailing and crying],
,Plankton:, ,[sighs], Oh, boy...
,[Bubbles change the scene to the bus Gary is on],
,Tourist:, So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again, real soon.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Carrying ""Gary""], Just a little further, Gare-Bare.
,Gary:, ,[Looks out window],
,Plankton:, Yes!
,[Gary pulls busline angrily and slithers over to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Puts ""Gary"" down on the floor next to the grill], Buddy, you just stay right here, and daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gary... ,[Walks away gloomily],
,Plankton:, Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!
,[Gary slithers to Plankton angrily and growls at him],
,Plankton:, Mommy?
,[Gary beats Plankton up, while Mr. Krabs hears this, and he sees Plankton running out the door], 
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton? ,[Finds out Gary beat him out of the restaurant and has an idea. Bubbles change the scene. Gary is at the Krusty Krab door letting people in, then Plankton, in a costume, comes up to Gary],
,Plankton:, Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare. ,[Gary Growls], Whoa, there, fido! ,[screams and runs away], I'm going! I'm going already!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Mr. Krabs, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer. He's really earning his pay!

,Fish:, ,[off-screen], Hey! ,[Patrick stops and looks around], Hey, you there!
,Patrick:, Uh, me?
,Fish:, Yes, you. ,[screams in Patrick's face], Get outta town! ,[Patrick screams and runs away. The fish scratches his head in confusion, then shrugs his shoulders. He turns to another fish who walks by], Get outta town! And take a vacation to beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. ,[hands the fish a flyer. Another fish walks up], Here ya go, sir. ,[hands him a flyer. The fish reads it. Scene cuts to Patrick running up to SpongeBob's house and opening the door],

,SpongeBob:, Sure, Patrick, ya... ,[Patrick screams and looks through the blinds on the window],
,Patrick:, I gotta get going! He told me to!
,SpongeBob:, Who did?
,Patrick:, Uhh, well, uhh... hmmm, I'm not sure. But he had a briefcase.
,SpongeBob:, Ahh, a briefcase?! He might be a paid assassin! ,[both start to cry], But, Patrick, you can't go. Not like this. Who will go with me to the next jellyfisherman's expo? ,[shows a picture of the two at one of the exposes],
,Patrick:, It'll have to be one of your other chums 'cause my mind is set. ,[sobbing],
,SpongeBob:, Unset it, please unset it! ,[they bawl and wail. Patrick walks over to SpongeBob's kitchen counter and sets a suitcase on it to start packing],

,Patrick:, I'm sorry, there's no stopping the unstoppable. Patrick Star will live no more, forever... in Bikini Bottom.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gets an idea], But... what if you weren't Patrick Star?
,Patrick:, Oh, no. I'm not Patrick Star?

,Patrick:, Huh? ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob putting a visor over Patrick's eyes], There ya go, Patrick. No one will know it's you. ,[Patrick looks in a mirror, screams at his reflection, then runs out of the pineapple through the wall, leaving a star-shaped hole.

,Larry:, Hey guys! Yo, Patrick, cool shades.

Goodbye coral. ,[hugs a coral branch, but pieces stick to him], YOW! ,[holds a few strands of seaweed], Goodbye seaweed.
,SpongeBob:, Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume. ,[looks at the seaweed], Hmmm...
,Patrick:, Goodbye sky. ,[SpongeBob walks up to Patrick and puts some seaweed on his head],
,SpongeBob:, That's it. With the seaweed on your head, you could be a...
,Patrick:, Oh, I know, I know! I could be Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. And live happily forever after in Bikini Bottom.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, there already is a Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. ,[scroll over to a monster with seaweed all over his hair and chest],
,Seaweed Monsterman:, Hey!
,Patrick:, D'oh!
,SpongeBob:, It's okay, Patrick. So you can't be a monster. But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be. ,[scene cuts to inside a store], You're all set. Come on out, Patrick. ,[Patrick walks out from behind a curtain wearing a yellow-green skirt and top, red lipstick, and a blonde wig with pigtails.

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hands SpongeBob a spatula], There be no such thing as opening too early, me boy. Excuse us, miss. Huh? ,[looks back at Patrick. Sparkles form by Patrick's head and Mr. Krabs' eyes explode from seeing the beauty], SpongeBob, who's your friend?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[eyes inflate back to normal], Patricia. The most beautiful sound I've ever seen. SpongeBob, do we need any more help down at the Krusty Krab?
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Mr. Krabs:, We do? Great, she can start right away. ,[scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where Squidward is reading the newspaper until he hears the door open],

,Squidward:, Hi, Patricia. I drew this for you. ,[hands him a piece of paper], Likeness is uncanny, if I do say so myself. ,[drawing on the piece of paper is Squidward. ,A woman's scream, is heard off-screen in horror of the picture],
,Patricia:, Uhh, thank you, Squidward. ,[Mr. Krabs comes out of the kitchen with two trays of food, one in each hand],

,Mr. Krabs:, That's a 7, Patricia. ,[is sitting at the table],
,Patricia:, Mr. Krabs, you ordered two Krusty meals?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Did I order two meals? Oh, silly me. I can't possibly eat two Krusty meals, myself. ,[spreads a table cloth, with a radio, on the table], I guess you'll just have to help me finish all this food.
,Patricia:, Okay. ,[sits down. Mr. Krabs pushes a button and some music plays],
,Mr. Krabs:, Patricia, we may have only known each other for a short time, now, but I feel like a special connection has been made.
,Patricia:, ,[Eats tablecloth, Krusty Meals, candle, and radio, then belches loudly],
,SpongeBob:, Quite an appetite, but she's all woman. ,[scene cuts to Patrick walking in the kitchen with two orders. Squidward plays a soothing song on his clarinet. He scoots closer to Patrick and puts his arm around him],
,Squidward:, Eh? Ya know, Patricia, they don't call me the 'Sizzle Lips Squid' for nothing. ,[Patrick tries to leave, but Squidward stops him], So, are you free this Saturday night?
,Patricia:, No, that's the night SpongeBob and I are having a staring contest.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob?!

,Patricia:, Well, I can't. SpongeBob and I will be flying submarines that night. I have to get back to Krusting the Krab. ,[walks off], Man, why are those two so nice to me? They were never this nice to Patrick. It's weird. ,[opens the cabinet in front of him and notices Squidward inside the shelf],
,Squidward:, Are you sure about Saturday night? ,[Patrick closes the cabinet],
,Patricia:, Persistent bunch. ,[turns on the faucet, but Mr. Krabs peeks his head out of the faucet head],
,Mr. Krabs:, How about Sunday brunch?
,Patricia:, No thanks, again! ,[turns the knob again and Mr. Krabs' head disappears as the water flows out. He walks over to the toaster where Squidward's head pops up],
,Squidward:, But I made reservations for two at...
,Patricia:, I said no. ,[presses the lever down, making Squidward's head sink back into the toaster.

It must have something to do with this disguise. I can't wear this any longer.
,SpongeBob:, But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom!
,Patricia:, Well, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I just can't live like this anymore. I'm tired of pretending to be someone I'm not. ,[opens the door to the dining room of the Krusty Krab. All the customers look up and greet him excitedly],
,Fancy Fish:, The lovely Patricia ,[blows a kiss], has returned to us!
,Patricia:, I have an announcement to make. The entire day that I've worked here I've wanted to say... ,[is struck speechless when he notices the fish from the beginning, giving out flyers, has entered the Krusty Krab], Um-um-um-uh... ,[the fish sits down at a table], I've wanted to say that, uhh, th-that... ,[nervously twirls one of his pigtails, presses his hands together, and scratches his head and arm], That I will eat any leftovers on your plate! ,[smiles and walks away],
,Customers:, Huh?
,Sunny Seashores Salesfish:, Ahoy, waitress, aren't you gonna take my order?
,Patricia:, I'll be right there, sir.
,SpongeBob:, What's the matter, Patrick?
,Patricia:, That's the guy with the briefcase. The guy who's trying to run me out of town.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], The assassin.
,Patricia:, ,[walks up to the customer], What can I get you, sir?
,Sunny Seashores Salesfish:, Say, don't I know you from somewhere?
,Patricia:, No!
,Sunny Seashores Salesfish:, Hmmm... that's it. Get outta town!
,Patricia:, He's onto us.
,SpongeBob:, I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town.
,Squidward & Mr. Krabs:, Patrick?!
,Sunny Seashores Salesfish:, You forgot your flyer. ,[hands them one of his flyers],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reading flyer], Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price.
,Patricia:, Well, I guess I don't need this disguise anymore. ,[rips off his disguise. Everyone gasps while Squidward's eyes shrink in horror],
,Squidward:, Umm, I think I need to take a shower.
,Mr. Krabs:, So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?
,Patrick:, No.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well then, you're fired. Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list? ,[Patrick and SpongeBob look at list and gasp at what is on it],
,Patrick and SpongeBob:, Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooo!

"SpongeBob:, ,[putting the meat on the patty], Easy... ,[takes all the condiments and throws them in the air. They all land nicely stacked on top of the patty], Perfection!
,Squidward:, Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now. ,[sniffles, starts to tear], You grew up so fast, I... ,[Squidward looks bored], Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this. ,[gives the order to Squidward], Just take it Squidward, take it away. ,[cries],
,Squidward:, Oh, brother. ,[into microphone], Number 5. Number 5!
,SpongeBob:, ,[shows a slip with the number 5 on it], That's me! ,[takes Krabby Patty and eats it], Mmm. My compliments to the chef! ,[laughs himself into the kitchen, where he notices something], Hello, what's this? ,[gets close to the window of the door where his eyes and Mr. Krabs' eyes meet],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come out here, boy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks outside], Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs SpongeBob and drags him under the dumpster], Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispering], What's a hidey-hole?
,Mr. Krabs:, It's where I hide me treasure. ,[pushes the dumpster aside and throws SpongeBob out of the hole], Catch! ,[throws a treasure chest at SpongeBob], Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!
,SpongeBob:, What's in this thing? Treasure?
,Mr. Krabs:, A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.
,SpongeBob:, Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform. ,[opens chest],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?
,Mr. Krabs:, Arrgh! ,[takes out a tattoo], It's me first tattoo.
,SpongeBob:, Neat.
,Mr. Krabs:, And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'. ,[shows a trophy with an arm at the top],
,SpongeBob:, How'd you win that?
,Mr. Krabs:, By being the toughest of the tough!
,SpongeBob:, Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys? ,[pointing to a picture with 5 sailors in it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's ""'Ol Iron Eye"", ,[shows guy with iron for an eye],, and ""Mutton Chop"", ,[shows guy holding a wrench],, me, ,[shows Mr. Krabs in a navy suit],, ""Torpedo Belly"", ,[shows big guy with torpedo in his belly],, and ""Lockjaw Jones"". ,[shows guy with a big jaw & leaning on an anchor],
,SpongeBob:, Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course! I was called ""Armor Abs Krabs"".
,SpongeBob:, You were?
,Mr. Krabs:, What do you mean?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess you were thinner back then.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, really? ,[takes his navy suit], This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds. ,[rips navy suit while trying to put it on], Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.
,SpongeBob:, You want me to punch you in the stomach?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!
,SpongeBob:, ,[punches Mr Krabs in the abs, but his arm breaks into little pieces], wow, my entire arm disintegrated.
,Mr. Krabs:, I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye, sir! ,[opens kitchen door], Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around! ,[point to potatoes], To battle stations. ,[pouring fries into the grease fryer], All hands on deck! ,[puts 10 Krabby Patties on the grill], Set course for full flavor. ,[turns knob on stove to the right], Ketchup and mustard off the port bow. ,[stepping on ketchup and mustard containers], One Krabby Patty ready to set sail. ,[holding krabby patty up],
,Mr. Krabs:, No! ,[SpongeBob drops his Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mr. Krabs. ,[knocks once on Mr. Krabs door and it opens], Hello? Mr. Krabs? ,[Mr. Krabs is shown head down on his desk], You alright? Are you sleepy? ,[pokes Mr. Krabs body knocking it to the floor, revealing an empty shell], Mr. Krabs! ,[sniffs his arm], I don't smell his pulse. ,[in the background, a fleshy and pink Mr. Krabs rushes past SpongeBob], What's that? ,[figure is behind a barrel], Is somebody there?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't look at me! Leave me be!
,SpongeBob:, ,[throws barrel away], You're alive! And naked...
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[crying], It's true. I've molted.
,SpongeBob:, What's molted?
,Mr. Krabs:, It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!
,SpongeBob:, Wow.
,Mr. Krabs:, 'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab! ,[sobs],
,SpongeBob:, Barnacles!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, Who cares how silly, pink & fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp & soft you are. How... ,[Mr. Krabs cries], ...oops.
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good... ,[kicks shell into the wall which ricochets back at SpongeBob. He screams. The shell lands on his hand and he runs around, screaming. Then he falls over and goes in his shell],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, it sure is dark in here. ,[pokes head through the shell], Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, you're a genius.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not what's about on the outside. It's what's on the in...
,Mr. Krabs:, No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.
,SpongeBob:, I get to be a navy buddy?
,Mr. Krabs:, Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years. ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, show me what you got.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pulls nose out to look like Mr. Krabs' then imitates his voice], Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.
,SpongeBob:, I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's me. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story. ,[pulls covers over the wallet], Goodnight, wallety. ,[kisses the wallet],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, okay, I get the point.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel. ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, That'll do, SpongeBob.
,[At the reunion],
,SpongeBob:, Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them! ,[at the reunion, a tough man is shown lifting Nancy on a treasure chest],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[hiding in a coral plant], No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, I won't let you down, sir.
,Mutton Chop:, Armor Abs Krabs. Come join your navy buddies in a toast.
,SpongeBob:, ,[high-pitched voice], Coming! ,[runs over to the table],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, what have I done?
,SpongeBob:, Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here.
,Mr. Krabs:, I've created a monster.
,Lockjaw Jones:, Here's some grog. You still like pineapple, right?
,SpongeBob:, Like pineapple? I live in one. ,[everyone laughs],
,Torpedo Belly:, That Ol' Krabs is manly as ever.
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.
,Mutton Chop:, Hey, Armor Abs, Ol' Iron Eye here has been itching to punch your legendary gut.
,SpongeBob:, Well, if you think you're man enough.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-oh, this could be bad.
,SpongeBob:, Fire the torpedoes. ,[Iron Eye punches SpongeBob. He bounces around in the shell then comes up dizzy],
,Mutton Chop:, What do you say, Krabs? Just like old times. ,[SpongeBob spits out a tooth],
,Lockjaw Jones:, A tooth.
,[SpongeBob spits out two more teeth],
,Torpedo Belly:, Teeth. Now, that's manly.
,[SpongeBob coughs out his skeleton and everyone gasps then cheers],
,Mr. Krabs:, He did it.
,Captain:, Alright, me swabbys, it's time to award the trophy of manly toughness. To a man who's toughness has stewed the test of time. And that man is: Eugene Armor Abs Krabs! Come up here , Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.
,Naval Buddies:, Armor Abs! Armor Abs! Armor Abs!
,SpongeBob:, Thanks for the trophy, everybody. ,[laughs],
,Naval Buddies:, Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
,SpongeBob:, I...uhh...
,Mr. Krabs:, Say something.
,SpongeBob:, Let me spin you a manly yarn.
,Mr. Krabs:, 'Atta boy.
,SpongeBob:, So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm doomed.
,SpongeBob:, Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...
,Mutton Chop:, Did he say Jellyfish Fields?
,Iron Eye:, Blowing bubbles?
,Mutton Chop:, Uhh, what were you doing in Jellyfish Fields?
,SpongeBob:, Why, jellyfishing, of course.
,Naval Buddies:, Huh?
,Mr. Krabs:, Phone call for Mr. Krabs! ,[SpongeBob is confused], ,[quietly yelling], Get off the stage.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks. ,[runs off the stage],
,Torpedo Belly:, Where do you think you're going? Everybody knows there's two things Ol' Armor Abs Krabs would never do.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh no.
,Lockjaw Jones:, Number one, is spend a penny.
,Torpedo Belly:, And the other one, is leave without giving Ol' Torpedo Belly one of your world famous steely belly butts. Haha
,SpongeBob:, ,[normal voice], Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean, ,[Mr. Krabs' voice], arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all.
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't watch. ,[SpongeBob & Torpedo Belly butt each other in the belly and sends SpongeBob flying],
,Torpedo Belly:, Armor Abs? ,[SpongeBob flies into a sign and then back into Torpedo Belly breaking the shell. SpongeBob is revealed and everyone gets angry],
,SpongeBob:, Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men.
,Mr. Krabs:, No! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am. ,[everyone gasps], Alright, lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable. ,[cries], But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, None taken, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, C'mon, lad, let's go home.
,Mutton Chop:, Wait a minute! You've forgotten something. ,[hands trophy to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't understand.
,Mutton Chop:, Admitting you lost your shell is the toughest thing I've ever seen. And, uhh, I have a confession. ,[rips off sideburns], These are fake! ,[SpongeBob & Mr. Krabs gasp],
,Torpedo Belly:, Over here.
,Mr. Krabs:, You, too, Torpedo Belly?
,Torpedo Belly:, Actually, I had my torpedo removed long ago.
,Lockjaw Jones:, And these aren't the same choppers that I had in the navy.
,Iron Eye:, My iron eye is actually made of Formica. ,[everyone laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back. ,[both laugh],

,SpongeBob:, Squidward?! Oh no, I accidentally joined this bad boy gang and I'm supposed to fight in the showdown so I get to save Gary, and I don't wanna go into the Witness Protection program, but I can't fight cause you're my friend.
,Squidward:, What are you talking about, jellyfish for brains! We are a troupe. ,[goes into a pose along with the other Pods.],
,SpongeBob:, A troupe? What do you mean?
,Squidward:, A dance troupe, you numb-skull! This is a dance showdown. No one is going to fight!

,Lonnie:, Oh that, that's just our fans, they scream and faint all the time. ,[points to the back where the fans are.],
,Fans:, We love you!
,SpongeBob:, What about the fruit vendor? He just gave you his fruit and ran away!
,Donnie:, That guy's a health nut, he's always worried we don't eat enough fruits.
,Food Vendor:, It keeps you regular! ,[throws an apple into Donnie's mouth.],
,SpongeBob:, But what about the club? The bouncer said you destroyed the place.
,Sharkface:, That was a total accident, that's how we lost Jonnie. ,[shows Jonnie dancing.], Jonnie thought he could do a quadruple pirouette, he lost control and he fell down, ,[shows Jonnie falling down and scratching up the floor with his teeth.], he scratched up the floor pretty bad, he won't be able to dance in days, maybe even a week!
,Lonnie, Ronnie, Donnie,:, Jonnie no!
,Squidward:, Oh brother.
,SpongeBob:, But, you Sharks kidnapped Gary!
,Sharkface:, We would never do such a thing!
,Lonnie:, Yeah, we were just giving him a ride, Gary's our DJ.

,SpongeBob:, Oh no! It's the coppers!
,Officer John:, We told you to stay off our turf lads!
,SpongeBob:, I'm so sorry officer, we were just dancing.
,Nancy O'Malley:, You call that dancing, move aside boy'os, this here is our beat.
,[Gary start playing bongos and the officers rip their clothes off and are in grass skirts, and start dancing, but internal affairs arrive.],
,Officer John:, ,[while spinning around torches.], Oh no, it's internal affairs!
,Internal Affairs Agent #1:, We're shutting you dirty dancing cops down.
,Internal Affairs Agent #2:, It's time to pop it,,[puts on hat.], and lock it.

,Patchy:, Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh... ,[Potty flies away], Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go? ,[enters something], Potty, you in here, buddy? Potty? POTTY!
,[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window],
,Potty:, ,[laughs and squawking] Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.,
,Patchy:, Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! ,[The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast], Now, what was I saying? (Patchy walks to his desk with so many phones and sits down) Now, this cartoon ain't like most of your ""land-lobbing cartoons"". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to call the number their that's scrolling at the bottom of the screen... ,[""1-800-624-4094 or go to Nick.com"" appears on the bottom of the screen (in ,the First 100 Episodes, version it says ""Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!"" instead). Phone starts ringing. Patchy picks up phone], No, not now! Don't call 'till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because- ,[More phones start to ring], Your not gonna make this easy are ya. Quiet! Vast their! Be laze that ringing! Stop! Its driving me mad!
,SpongeBob:, (yawns)  Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! ,[checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house], Holy shrimp! ,[runs out to Squidward], Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! ,[Squidward pokes his head through his window], Squidward! The sky had a baby!
,Squidward:, ,[Looks at the anchor and annoyed at SpongeBob's idiocy],That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! ,[Patrick comes over],
,Patrick:, ,[Stupidly],Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
,SpongeBob:, I know! What do you think we should name it?
,Patrick:, How about...
,Squidward:, Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! ,[Anchor crashes into Squidward's house], Now look what you've done!
,SpongeBob:, We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands],
,Patrick:, Clean...
,Squidward:, ,[on top of his house], Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
,SpongeBob:, Wouldn't that be the top? ,[Squidward starts to climb rope],
,SpongeBob:, Squid, wait! Wait!
,Patrick:, Squidward! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also],
,Narrator:, A few inches later...
,SpongeBob:, ,[points up], Ship!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
,SpongeBob:, No, look, a giant ship!,[A giant green ship is seen. Patrick is shocked to see he was wrong while Squidward is not fazed.],
,Squidward:, Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
,Squidward:, That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
,SpongeBob:, Squid, wait! ,[all 3 reach the top],
,Squidward:, All right, who owns this crate? ,[notices a door that says ""owner"" and begins to knock on it], Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! ,[SpongeBob looks around the ship],
,SpongeBob:, Doesn't this place seem familiar?
,Patrick:, I don't know. Why?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? ,[Squidward rings the doorbell],
,Patrick:, Yes!
,SpongeBob:, I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. ,[SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says ""property of the Flying Dutchman""],
,Flying Dutchman:, Rawr!
,SpongeBob:, No, no, it's not ""rawr!""
,Flying Dutchman:, I am the Flying Dutchman!
,SpongeBob:, That's it! ,[Stupidly],Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
,Flying Dutchman:, Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Oblivious],It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. ,[Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward as he waits for answer],
,Squidward:, ,[Nervously],I...no, I don't.
,SpongeBob:, Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? ,[Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[laughs nervously], I never said that.
,Flying Dutchman:, Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
,SpongeBob:, No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. ,[shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[screams], Ow.
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick], You're next!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[jumps off the ship], That was a close one! ,[land back on the ship],
,Flying Dutchman:, Welcome back!
,SpongeBob:, ,[he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship], That was a closer one! ,[land back on the ship],
,Flying Dutchman:, Welcome back! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship],
,Squidward:, Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... ,[Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship],
,Flying Dutchman:, So, are you gonna try that again?
,Patrick:, Probably. ,[Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward],
,Flying Dutchman:, How 'bout now?
,Patrick:, Uhh...
,Squidward:, ,[covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle], No, no, they're not. Whew. ,[Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward],
,Flying Dutchman:, Now listen. ,[takes out a ""Ghost Rule Book""], Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! ,[closes rule book], And, uhh ,[opens rule book],, ever. ,[closes rule book],
,Squidward:, Will we be getting business cards?
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[zaps Squidward], Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.
,Squidward:, Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! ,[holds up a green jockstrap], Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... ,[Dutchman picks up Squidward], Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... ,[Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air], Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? ,[Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick watch Squidward disappear from sight with a clearly worried expression.],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[closes Fly of Despair], Would anyone else like to enter the ""Fly of Despair""?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Terrified],No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.
,Patrick:, ,[Terrified as well],We'll do anything you say!
,Flying Dutchman:, Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! ,[hands them a mop and a bucket],
,SpongeBob:, Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
,Patrick:, And I got this hat!
,Flying Dutchman:, Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
,SpongeBob:, You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
,Patrick:, No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
,SpongeBob:, Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
,Patrick:, I don't get it.
,SpongeBob:, Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
,Flying Dutchman:, Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
,SpongeBob:, So, you don't want it to look good?
,Flying Dutchman:, Get moving! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are scared and start mopping],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket], A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
,Flying Dutchman:, What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! ,[howls like a wolf],
,SpongeBob:, ,[bleats like a sheep],
,Patrick:, Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[howls like a wolf],
,SpongeBob:, ,[bleats like a sheep],
,Patrick:, Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! ,[Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off], Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! ,[Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off], Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! ,[Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off], Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
,[Very long and awkward silence],
,Flying Dutchman:, Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
,SpongeBob:, Let's see who we can find. ,[spins telescope on ground], Captain, there's a guy we can scare. ,[telescope points to a big tough guy. The Flying Dutchman stares wide eyed, then nervously blows on the telescope, spinning it slightly to land on a little kid],
,Billy:, ,[sing-song voice], I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
,Flying Dutchman:, Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
,Patrick:, Moving behind the rocks! ,[ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea],
,SpongeBob:, Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
,Flying Dutchman:, All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. ,[Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock],
,Flying Dutchman:, Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! ,[points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse],
,SpongeBob:, Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
,Flying Dutchman:, With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers],
,Patrick:, How does he do that?
,Flying Dutchman:, Get back on the ship.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, It's still a mystery!
,Billy:, Those guys are dorks.
,Flying Dutchman:, Yes, but they're my dorks. ,[goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship],
,SpongeBob:, You're good. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked], You're good. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked], You're good.. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship], Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
,Patrick:, Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
,SpongeBob:, Like movie passes?
,Patrick:, Or an oversized coffee mug?! ,[both start bouncing insanely],
,Flying Dutchman:, I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! ,[both stop], This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
,SpongeBob:, You're setting us free?
,Flying Dutchman:, Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream],
,Patrick:, Wait, I have an idea!
,SpongeBob:, Really?! What is it?
,Patrick:, Let's leave!
,SpongeBob:, But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. ,[points to a room full of perfume and customers],
,Patrick:, Let's do it. ,[they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume. Someone even goes as far as removing Patrick's gas mask and spraying him in the face with perfume],
,SpongeBob:, ,[panting],I always hate going in there!
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hears something strange], Wait! Listen! ,[Flying Dutchman is in his room],
,Flying Dutchman:, Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... ,[notices sock is gone and sees SpongeBob and Patrick peeping on him before escaping.],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[On the ship, SpongeBob and Patrick are running but the Dutchman pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick], Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
,SpongeBob:, Never!
,Flying Dutchman:, Okay, then... ,[tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection], Give it to me!
,SpongeBob:, No! ,[Sock begins to tear],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[panicking],Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
,Patrick:, It would seem we have reached an impasse.
,Flying Dutchman:, Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
,Patrick:, Make it five.
,Flying Dutchman:, Four.
,Patrick:, Three. Take it or leave it.
,Flying Dutchman:, Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
,SpongeBob:, Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
,Patrick:, Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! ,[clock goes backwards one minute],
,Flying Dutchman:, Okay, you got two wishes left. ,[Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Taps Patrick on the shoulder],Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! ,[Squidward is screaming as he falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed],
,Squidward:, ,[Relieved],Boy, I'm glad all that's over! ,[disappears and re-appears on the ship.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Squidward! You're back!,[Squidward looks around shocked.],
,SpongeBob:, Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... ,[realizing], just used the second one.
,Squidward:, Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
,Patrick:, ,[Protesting],Wait! I think it belongs to me! ,[everyone starts to argue], Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
,SpongeBob:, ,[Angrily],Well, that's not right because... ,[their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting],
,Flying Dutchman:, That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. ,[uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method], Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...
,Voting Guy:, All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!
,Patchy:, Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be, Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good 'Ol SpongeBob. ,[""Just dial the number below: 1-800-624-4094 or go to Nick.com and tell us who you be choosing"" appears on the bottom of the screen (again, in ,the First 100 Episodes, version it has been changed to ""Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!"")], My trusty crew, is eagerly awaiting your call. So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, And we'll be right back to announce, the winner! ,[Cuts To Commercials, then ""That's it, kids! Keep them coming! It's almost time! Keep those votes in! Ha Ha Ha! WHOO! Democracy! Ha Ha Ha! WHOO! This is Patchy, please hold. Potty's not here. Well, not yet. HA HA HA HA!"" appears on screen (in ,the First 100 Episodes, version, this text was removed entirely)], Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it’s time for you to walk the plank! ,[Screen reads: PLEASE STAND BY], Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner! ,[blows horn], But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter ology, You didn't choose, Patrick. ,[An image of Patrick is shown, with a skull in front of him.], But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh gaw!
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo], You are it! ,[Stops on Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
,Patrick:, Uhh...
,Squidward:, Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... ,[demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end], Understand?!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.
,Patrick:, Uhh...
,SpongeBob:, That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
,Patrick:, Uhh...
,Squidward and SpongeBob:, Come on! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Put on your thinking cap!
,Patrick:, Uhh... ,[Inside Patrick's eye is a toaster that brings up some toast.], Okay! I've got it.
,Flying Dutchman:, Thou wish is granted.
,Patrick:, ,[Chewing on gum.], Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum? ,[SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked.],
,Squidward:, You wished for gum?
,Patrick:, Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
,[Each take a piece of gum. Later, we see Flying Dutchman with a big belly.],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!
,Patrick:, Aaaah! Let us out!
,Flying Dutchman:, Ahh, minty.
,Patchy:, Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Molarchy! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh! ,[An image of Squidward is shown, with a skull in front of him.], It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Eeny-Minie-Mo finger landed on Squidward!
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo], You are it! ,[Stops on Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!
,Squidward:, That's right! And you know what I wish?
,Patrick:, No!
,Squidward:, I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
,Flying Dutchman:, So be it.
,SpongeBob:, Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.
,Patrick:, Hi.
,Squidward:, That's not what I meant!
,Flying Dutchman:, Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner! ,[Flying Dutchman appears with a big belly],
,SpongeBob:, And what did you say your name was?
,Squidward:, I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward. ,[Tries to pronounce it right], We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. ,[Laughs.],
,Patchy:, And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because its time to announce, the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is, SpongeBob! ,[A flag is shown with SpongeBob with the words ""Winner"" on the left side, Patchy blows his nose], Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
,Potty:, Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! ,[Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast],
,Patchy:, And now, the most requested ending! Hooray! ,[Potty collapses to the floor],
,Flying Dutchman:, ,[finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo], You are it! ,[stops on SpongeBob],
,Squidward:, Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! ,[Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads],
,SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward:, Hooray!
,SpongeBob:, We're home!
,Patrick:, You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
,Squidward:, But why have we been turned into fruits? ,[their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender],
,Flying Dutchman:, Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy! ,[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender], Hey, get back here with that! ,[Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast.,
,Patchy:, ,[sitting at the couch crying], Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It’s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lobbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now your an official big time cartoon decision maker! ,[Cuts to a bunch of monkeys at a zoo], Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!
,Potty:, Sqwuak! I quit! I quit!
,Patchy:, Ohhh! Oh, that's it, folks! Right now, I got a little employee management to take care of! Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage! Potty, I'm not kidding!
,Narrator:, And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special! Thanks for voting!

,Patchy:, Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! ,[The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast], Well, roll the cartoon.[screen fades to black, episode starts]

,Flying Dutchman:, Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
,SpongeBob:, You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
,Patrick:, No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
,SpongeBob:, Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
,Patrick:, I don't get it.
,SpongeBob:, Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
,Flying Dutchman:, Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
,SpongeBob:, So, you don't want it to look good?
,Flying Dutchman:, Get moving! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket], A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
,Flying Dutchman:, What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! ,[howls like a wolf],

,[Very long and awkward silence],
,Flying Dutchman:, Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
,SpongeBob:, Let's see who we can find. ,[spins telescope on ground], Captain, there's a guy we can scare. ,[telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it slightly to land on a little kid],
,Billy:, ,[sing-song voice], I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
,Flying Dutchman:, Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
,Patrick:, Moving behind the rocks! ,[ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea],
,SpongeBob:, Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
,Flying Dutchman:, All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. ,[Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock],
,Flying Dutchman:, Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! ,[points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused],
,SpongeBob:, Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
,Flying Dutchman:, With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers],
,Patrick:, How does he do that?
,Flying Dutchman:, Get back on the ship.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, It's still a mystery!
,Billy:, Those guys are dorks.
,Flying Dutchman:, Yes, but they're my dorks. ,[goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship],
,SpongeBob:, You're good. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks.

 You're good.. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship], Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Like movie passes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Or an oversized coffee mug?! ,[both start bouncing insanely],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! ,[both stop], This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You're setting us free?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Wait, I have an idea!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Really?! What is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Let's leave!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. ,[points to a room full of perfume and customers],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Let's do it. ,[they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I always hate going in there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[hears something strange], Wait! Listen! ,[Flying Dutchman is in his room],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... ,[notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick], Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Never!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Okay, then... ,[tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection], Give it to me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No! ,[Sock begins to tear],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, It would seem we have reached an impasse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Make it five.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Four.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Three. Take it or leave it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! ,[clock goes backwards one minute],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, Okay, you got two wishes left. ,[Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! ,[falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Boy, I'm glad all that's over! ,[re-appears on the ship],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob and Patrick:, Squidward! You're back!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... ,[realizing], just used the second one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Wait! I think it belongs to me! ,[everyone starts to argue], Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Well, that's not right because... ,[their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flying Dutchman:, That's enough!

Squidward:, Hurry, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish that the Dutchman was a vegetarian! ,[Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house, but you can only see their heads],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward:, Hooray!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potty:, Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! ,[Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ,Squidward:, Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! ,[Anchor crashes into Squidward's house], Now look what you've done!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ,Squidward:, Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Squid, wait! ,[all 3 reach the top],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, All right, who owns this crate? ,"[notices a door that says """"owner"""" and begins to knock on it]", Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! ,[SpongeBob looks around the ship],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ,Flying Dutchman:, Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. ,[Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, I...no, I don't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? ,[Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, ,[laughs nervously], I never said that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ,Flying Dutchman:, Welcome back! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... ,[Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, So, are you gonna try that again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Probably. ,[Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, How 'bout now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Uhh...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, ,[covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle], No, no, they're not. Whew. ,[Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ,Flying Dutchman:, ,[zaps Squidward], Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! ,[shows a green jockstrap], Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... ,[Dutchman picks up Squidward], Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... ,[Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air], Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? ,[Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair.

 ,SpongeBob:, You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, I don't get it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Look, it's easy, it simply means that...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ,Patrick:, Moving behind the rocks! ,[ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. ,[Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! ,[points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, How does he do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Get back on the ship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob and Patrick:, It's still a mystery!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Billy:, Those guys are dorks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Yes, but they're my dorks. ,[goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, You're good. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked], You're good. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked], You're good.. You're good. You're good. ,[Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship], Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Like movie passes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Or an oversized coffee mug?! ,[both start bouncing insanely],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! ,[both stop], This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, You're setting us free?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Wait, I have an idea!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Really?! What is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Let's leave!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. ,[points to a room full of perfume and customers],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Let's do it. ,[they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, I always hate going in there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, ,[hears something strange], Wait! Listen! ,[Flying Dutchman is in his room],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... ,[notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick], Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Never!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Okay, then... ,[tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection],Give it to me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, No! ,[Sock begins to tear],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, It would seem we have reached an impasse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Make it five.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Four.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Three. Take it or leave it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! ,[clock goes backwards one minute],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Okay, you got two wishes left. ,[Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! ,[falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, Boy, I'm glad all that's over! ,[re-appears on the ship],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Squidward! You're back!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... ,[realizing], just used the second one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, Wait! I think it belongs to me! ,[everyone starts to argue], Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Well, that's not right because... ,[their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. ,[uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method], Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... ,[finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo], You are it! ,[stops on SpongeBob],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, Hurry, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish that the Dutchman was a vegetarian! ,[Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house, but you can only see their heads],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward:, Hooray!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,SpongeBob:, We're home!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Patrick:, You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Squidward:, But why have we been turned into fruits? ,[their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,Flying Dutchman:, Hey, I get a wish, too. ,[slices some fruits to the blender], Fruit prevents scurvy! ,[he whistles as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward scream and bounce away in the blender], Hey, get back here with that! ,[Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The first day of spring in Bikini Bottom. The flowers are blooming, the rainbows are... how you say? Bowing. The jellyfish are buzzing, ,[flowers grow all over SpongeBob's house, covering it], and it's time for the traditional...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow! ,[Gary meows in pain. SpongeBob is singing while using Gary as a vacuum cleaner to clean up his house],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SpongeBob:, Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Patrick runs through his pile of junk to get a cotton swab],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob! ,[Patrick cleans his belly button], See ya again next spring. ,[notices trash can], Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh!? You're throwing this away!? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value. ,[gasps], You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hmm. Maybe Patrick is right. All of these things do hold precious memories. ,[garbage man tries to take junk. SpongeBob gasps], No! ,[tries to take his junk back], Come on, you! ,[continues to pull], Gotcha! Welcome home, precious memories. ,[puts back his junk and saves empty box of Kelpo and toy wrapper], Plastic wrap is neat, huh, Gary?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow! ,[Gary is on top of old newspaper],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab], Order up! Careful with these ones, Squidward. They're special.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, You're right. I'm going to need something to preserve the memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, perfect! ,[SpongeBob keeps the Krabby Patties grease], Ah, memories. Greasy memories.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Whoo-wee! Nothing like a hard day of work at the Krusty Krab, eh, Squidward? Whew!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob saves his work sweat],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, You're sentimental about your sweat?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, that's not all! And I'm also very sentimental about these Krusty Krab keepsakes, so many memories! Grill grease, gum from under the Krusty Krab tables, today's mop water, bendy straws, mayonnaise, a collection of freshly used ketchup packets, and these are today's order tickets written by my favorite fellow employee, Squidward. See? This one has your tentacle print on it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Okay, this is getting creepy now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, well, better get these precious memories home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Officially creeped out now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob singing],♪Memories, doo doo doo memories, doo doo doo doo memories.♪ ,[opens his door while all of his junk is there], Hey, Gary. ,[Gary is on top of more old newspaper trying to eat his food. SpongeBob going up the stairs with junk in his wagon], Oh. Safe and sound! ,[SpongeBob's junk almost falls down, but SpongeBob closes the door before it falls down], Whoo, closed up tight! And you said it wouldn't fit. ,[all of SpongeBob's junk falls out],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary:, Meow, meow, meow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, nonsense, Gary, I'll find a place to put everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob looks outside],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Like the front yard!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward is sleeping and gets up by the clock. Squidward gasps when he sees SpongeBob's junk. Squidward opens his door when all of SpongeBob's junk is in the way. Squidward knocks on SpongeBob's door],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Who is it? ,[in a singing voice],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, It's Squidward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, How do I know it's you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Open the door, nitwit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Squidward, can I help you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, You can certainly help... ,[Squidward looks at SpongeBob], Why are you wearing garbage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Thanks for noticing, Squidward, and may I say that's a very becoming dress you're wearing this morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Ah, not the sanitation police! You don't understand, these things aren't junk! They're my friends, like this little guy, ,[SpongeBob crying at a light bulb], Alfred the light bulb. Oh, we had a great time together, Al, reading, paying the bills. Why is it the ones who glow brightest burn out the soonest?! ,[SpongeBob starts to cry], You will be missed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call. ,[cops come],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, Sanitation police! This is a raid. Step away from the refuse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Thank goodness you're here, officer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop:, Is this your filthy home?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Hi!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, Thanks for the information, citizen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cop 1:, Do your duty, Sergeant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 2:, ,"[Puts a sticker that reads """"COMDEMNED"""" on SpongeBob's house]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, This residence is now comdemned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Condemned? What does that mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, Condemned means this house is unfit to live in. You'll have to vacate the home immediately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Vacate? You mean I have to move?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, Anything that is a threat to public health must be condemned. Sergeant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 2:, ,"[Puts a sticker that reads """"CONDEMNED"""" on the trashbag on SpongeBob's head]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Thank you again, officers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Wait! Please don't condemn my house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, I'll request a commendation for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, Right after we condemn ,your, house!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, My house?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, Yes! It's as filthy as your neighbor's. ,[Shows Squidward's house from the outside being as dirty as SpongeBob's],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, But isn't there anything we can do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, You can evacuate the premises or throw away your junk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Throw them away?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cop 1:, Thank you for the attempt, ma'am.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Ma'am? It's a nightshirt! ,[the cops leave], This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, I know. ,[crying], I'm gonna miss them so much! ,[continues crying],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, You really miss them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, No. I'll be strong. ,[continues crying again],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, That's a great idea, Squidward! Then years from now, I can look at the photos, and remember my... remember my precious little babies!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Creepy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward, the latter with his hat on and the former holding it, as the garbage man takes the junk away. He elbows Squidward to get his attention, and then points to his head to remind him to take his hat off.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, ,[mutters under his breath], Oh, good grief. ,[takes his hat off],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[SpongeBob sniffles as the garbage man takes the last can of junk away and throws it into the truck. SpongeBob walks over to him, holding up some dollar bills.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Your pay, my good man. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[The garbage man takes the money and gets into the truck. SpongeBob sniffs again as the truck begins to drive back to the dump.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, ,[fighting back tears], Goodbye, little friends. Have fun at the dump! ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[the garbage truck drives away], ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Alright, nighty-night. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Idiot. ,[opens his door full of photos. He sees a picture of Pete], What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpongeBob:, Oh, I forgot to tell you, I took so many pictures I ran out of room in my house. ,[He opens the door too filled with photos and Patrick appears sliding with photos], ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patrick:, Nice dress. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!♪,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squidward:, Please don't do that again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Howard:, ,[walks in the Krusty Krab], I think the stain glass barstool can go over here. And the suede hand carved wooden sports flag display case can go over there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Howard:, ,[slaps Mr. Krabs’ claw], What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon... ,[suitcase full of money is shown to Mr. Krabs], Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think, Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Howard:, Oh, there's a lot more than that. The rest is over there. ,[points to a boat full of suitcases with money],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr. Krabs:, Jumpin' King Neptune! ,[gulps], Sold. Can I have my money?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Krabs:, Do I still get the money?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Howard:, Of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The screen flashes white, and the machine goes through all sorts of dimensions, with one with a computer-like area, then the screen does a color change effect again, with the time machine folding like paper, and it vanishes with a zap sound.],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[Squidward appears in a blank, white space. He walks around, and hears a strange voice. He then notices some colored tiles and lifts one up and it floats and vanishes],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you. ,[the thing takes SpongeBob's blanket], You keep the change. ,[the thing takes SpongeBob's pillow], What? ,[he wakes up fully and stares fixedly at the thing in terror; camera zooms out to show half of the pineapple house's walls missing; a new scene shows SpongeBob talking to the crowd at the Krusty Krab], I saw it!

,Sandy:, ,[laughs good-naturedly], Aw, shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all. ,[Mr. Krabs chuckles, which gradually turns into crying; Sandy continues], Nope. I'm not gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone! ,[she shows them; crowd gasps], Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward! ,[crowd sympathizes], I am gonna get back what's mine! ,[crowd cheers],

,Sandy:, Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here. ,[she pulls out a wallet with pictures], Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms. ,[we see pictures of a real-life squirrel with a lasso around a bull, then a lasso around a worm], Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope.

,Sandy:, So's Patrick's belly button, but I ain't afraid of that neither!
,SpongeBob:, You'll get massacred! ,[collapses into sponge-cubes],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, I'm from Texas. What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different ""big""s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?
,Sandy:, If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?
,SpongeBob:, ,[unconvincingly], Um, I do?
,Sandy:, You do? Where?
,SpongeBob:, Um... in my pocket.
,Sandy:, Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on! ,[SpongeBob looks nervous, pulls something from his pocket, and opens his hand], SpongeBob, that's a paper clip and a piece of string.
,SpongeBob:, ,[shakes head, meekly], No, it's not. This is your tail.
,Sandy:, ,[annoyed], SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, ,[defensively], How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go! ,[he jumps onto the front of Sandy's air helmet and hugs it],
,Sandy:, ,[pulls him off], SpongeBob, what is the matter with you? Now, I'm gonna go give that legless rascal what-for, and there ain't nothing you can say to stop me! ,[resumes walking],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'?
,Sandy:, ,[stops], Well, I gotta admit, that's slowin' me down, but I'm still going for him! ,[continues],
,SpongeBob:, ,[appears next to Sandy as she strides along], You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home. ,[Sandy keeps walking; SpongeBob reappears], I've got ice cream! With nuts... ,[Sandy continues; SpongeBob appears once more, this time with a goofy squirrel mask on his face], Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!
,Sandy:, You ain't my pa!
,SpongeBob:, ,[stands in front of her with boxing gloves], Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me! ,[Sandy pushes through his body as if walking through a pair of swinging doors; he grabs her ankles, crying], Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!
,Sandy:, Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!
,SpongeBob:, ,[still crying and holding onto her ankles], No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom? ,[she grabs an anchor and pulls a boat down from the surface],
,SpongeBob:, You are.
,Sandy:, And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, ""K"" in karate? ,[makes a K shape],
,SpongeBob:, ,[shaped like a U], You did.
,Sandy:, And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?
,SpongeBob:, ,[his butt has ""Property of Sandy Cheeks"" printed on it, states it meekly], You do.
,Sandy:, Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is! There ain't nothin' too big or too ornery for me to catch.
,SpongeBob:, Okay.
,Sandy:, Say it.
,SpongeBob:, There isn't anything...
,Sandy:, Ain't nothin'!
,SpongeBob:, ,[in a high-pitched voice like Sandy], Ain't nothin' ,[normal voice], too big or too ornery for you to catch. But... ,[Sandy cuts him off], But... ,[cuts him off again], And... ,[cuts him off again], We... ,[cuts him off again], I... ,[cuts him off again], Yeah but...

,Sandy:, No!
,SpongeBob:, I... ,[Sandy cuts him off one last time with a frustrated groan],
,Sandy:, ,[picks up some sand from the ground as if tracking an animal and sniffs it], Worm sign. ,[she holds a small sign in her palm that has ""WORM"" painted on it; looks up], He's in that cave.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, are you sure you...?
,Sandy:, Course I am! I'm going in, and I ain't coming out 'til I got me a big heaping plate of worm stew. ,[she walks into the cave; SpongeBob hides behind a rock and shudders; we hear Sandy inside the cave], Aha! There you are, you tail-nabbin' varmint! Hi-yah! ,[we hear karate noises; Sandy peeks out of the cave], I'm winnin', SpongeBob! ,[resumes fighting],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, that's not...! ,[more fighting noises; Sandy peeks out again],
,Sandy:, This shouldn't take long. ,[resumes fighting],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, that's not...!
,Sandy:, Almost done!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy!
,Sandy:, Yee-haw! ,[comes out riding a pink segmented thing], I got him, SpongeBob! ,[makes a giant knot and stands on it proudly],
,SpongeBob:, ,[still uneasy], Sandy...?
,Sandy:, Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail! ,[we see that she has tied the fur to the small remainder of her tail],
,SpongeBob:, That's not the worm.
,Sandy:, ,[looking annoyed with her arms crossed], Pardon?
,SpongeBob:, That's not the worm. That's his tongue. ,[camera zooms out to show that SpongeBob is right; the opening of the cave is actually the worm's open mouth; his eyes make a squishy blinking noise],
,Sandy:, Ohhhh. This is the tongue, and... the whole thing... is the... worm. ,[freaks out], ,RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIFE!!!!, ,[they sprint away; the worm chomps down, roars angrily, and chases after them],
,SpongeBob:, So what's the plan, Sandy? ,[they look back and see that the worm is approaching faster],
,Sandy:, Run faster!
,SpongeBob:, I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!
,Sandy:, Later!
,SpongeBob:, Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?
,Sandy:, Not now, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, I wanna hear you say it!
,Sandy:, Can we talk about this another time?
,SpongeBob:, Say it!
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Say it, or I'll trip you! ,[he continues running on one foot, the other poised to trip Sandy],
,Sandy:, No!
,SpongeBob:, Say it!
,Sandy:, Not now!
,SpongeBob:, Say it!
,Sandy:, Okay! You were right, and I was wrong. I was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Are you happy now?
,SpongeBob:, ,[smiles triumphantly], I knew it. ,[the worm emits another huge growl; prompting the two to run even faster; they run up and down a sand mound, which the worm plows right through; they run past Fish 3, who is leaning over under his car's hood; his butt is bandaged up; the worm passes by and takes another bite out of him],
,Fish 3:, Not again!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Sandy?
,Sandy:, Yeah?
,SpongeBob:, What do we do now?
,Sandy:, ,[is panting and sweating; the worm growls again; Sandy sees the seemingly endless coral trees in front of them], I've got it! SpongeBob, you still got that paper clip and that string?
,SpongeBob:, I'm way ahead of you, Sandy. ,[fashions a necklace out of them], Look, it's a necklace! S for ""SpongeBob"" or S for ""Sandy""! That way they can identify our bodies.
,Sandy:, No, silly! How about S for ""save our skins""? ,[she takes the string and uses the hook of the paper clip to wrap the string around one of the coral trees; she grabs SpongeBob and swings them up and over the branch onto the worm's back], Yee-haw! Now this is what I call a rodeo! We'll be nice and safe up here. ,[the worm starts to plow off a cliff like a runaway train; Sandy and SpongeBob realize this, scream, and begin running toward the end of worm to the safety of the plateau; they jump off safely as the worm falls off the cliff], We did it!
,SpongeBob:, Yay! He'll never get out of there!
,Sandy:, We saved the town!
,SpongeBob:, Yay! Let's go tell everybody! ,[they leave the scene and new scene shows all the citizens still trying to push Bikini Bottom to safety; the city is now in the valley at the bottom of the cliff],
,Patrick:, Push! ,[citizens push the city], Push! ,[push one last time],
,Citizens:, Hooray! ,[the worm lands on the city and crushes it],
,Worm:, Ouuuuuch...

"SpongeBob:, Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy! ,[While knocking on her door, a spaceship comes up from underneath the ground at the left side of the tree dome], Wow! ,[Sandy peeks her head out of a spaceship window],
,Sandy:, Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?
,SpongeBob:, What is it?
,Sandy:, It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Sandy rides an elevator on the bottom floor and meets SpongeBob downstairs], Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
,Sandy:, ,[pointing to a poster of the moon], I'm going to the moon, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, The moon! Can I go?
,Sandy:, No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird. ,[shown a graveyard of dead animals], Besides, there's not enough room for you.
,SpongeBob:, But I don't take up that much space! ,[squishes himself into a little square], See? ,[downsizes himself to fit into a little drawer], I can fit in here. ,[closes the drawer], Mmm, cozy.
,Sandy:, I need that drawer.
,SpongeBob:, Well, how about... ,[jumps into a test tube], This? ,[jumps into another test tube], Or this? ,[jumps into another test tube], Or this?
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, this isn't for fun. ,[shows her clipboard with math equations on it], See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. ,[SpongeBob is behind a set of bars],
,SpongeBob:, Fine. ,[deep voice], Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
,Sandy:, That's the air vent, SpongeBob. ,[pushes a button to turn the air vent on that blows SpongeBob out of it], I need that, too.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
,Sandy:, All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
,SpongeBob:, ,[running around the ship], Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!
,Sandy:, ,[grabs SpongeBob], But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? ,[Cuts to Sandy pumping a gun and SpongeBob comes to watch her],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
,Sandy:, Aww, hush, silly. ,[shoots her gun and 3 gray nets cover a couple items], This is for harvesting moon rocks.
,SpongeBob:, Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
,Sandy:, Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores? ,[walks around and forms a circle around him and Sandy with his shoes], And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night? ,[sees a circle], Ah! There's one now!
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind.
,SpongeBob:, ,[trying to sleep. Checks the clock every few seconds], Oh, hurry up! ,[grabs two clothes pins and puts them on his eyelids], These oughta do the trick.
,Patrick:, ,[Sitting in the window], Hi ya, SpongeBob! ,[clothes pins shoot off his eyes],
,SpongeBob:, What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
,Patrick:, Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
,SpongeBob:, A present?
,Patrick:, No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
,SpongeBob:, There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
,Patrick:, ,[shows a spray can], Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
,SpongeBob:, Alien repellent? Let me see that. ,[looks at the can], New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the rocket],
,Patrick:, Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, It's pretty impressive, all right.
,Patrick:, Come on! ,[both head for the rocket],
,SpongeBob:, We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Wow. How do you think we get inside? ,[pulls a level that says ""open""],
,SpongeBob:, We don't, we're just spraying the... ,[door opens on SpongeBob], ...windows.
,Patrick:, I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on! ,[both walk inside], Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, just don't touch anything. ,[Patrick starts playing with everything],
,Patrick:, Look, I'm winning!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun... ,[SpongeBob turns around and looks at himself as thin in the mirror], ...house?
,Patrick:, Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
,Patrick:, I don't know! ,[notices a lever above his head], But let's see what this does!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I don't think we should... ,[Patrick pulls a lever and the two launch off the seat out of the rocket],
,Patrick:, I like rockets. ,[both fall back into the rocket],
,Patrick:, More! More!
,SpongeBob:, No more! ,[Patrick presses a button and both shake a lot then stop], Okay, one more. ,[shake again], Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
,Patrick:, Oh, wait, I think this one starts it. ,[SpongeBob stops Patrick from pushing a button],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. ,[presses the engine button and the ship starts up and is blasting off],
,Patrick:, We've started the rocket!
,Sandy:, ,[notices the smoke], Oh, SpongeBob... ,[SpongeBob and Patrick hold onto each other while the ship is taking off],
,Patrick:, Hold on, buddy! ,[while screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick are falling down to the bottom of the ship. The ship enters space and both of them start to float], Hey, we stopped falling!
,SpongeBob:, Look! ,[points at the dark galaxy], We're in space now! Wee! ,[both float around in the ship],
,Patrick:, Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something! ,[SpongeBob laughs as the ship is going around the moon], Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! ,[squirts toothpaste into some peanut butter],
,SpongeBob:, Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! ,[SpongeBob lifts a heavy weight on one finger], Patrick, I can do this! ,[the ship is landing back into the sea and the heavy weight hurls into the ground and flattens SpongeBob's hand],
,Patrick:, Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
,SpongeBob:, We must be landing.
,Patrick:, All right! ,[Sandy uses her jetpack to fly up to the moon],
,Sandy:, Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. ,[the ship is now in Bikini Bottom. While Sandy searches for SpongeBob and Patrick on the moon, these two get out of the ship],
,Patrick:, Wow, it sure looks a lot like home. ,[Patrick sees Gary asleep], Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
,SpongeBob:, Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
,Patrick:, So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
,SpongeBob:, Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it! ,[SpongeBob captures Gary with a gray net-like substance], Yeah!
,Patrick:, You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
,SpongeBob:, Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me! ,[grabs Gary], Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! ,[tosses Gary into the ship. Ship's number increases from 00 to 01; ding from ""The Price Is Right""],
,Patrick:, Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
,SpongeBob:, Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to. ,[whispering to Patrick], Make sure your gun is pumped. ,[go in and see Squidward sleeping], Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting. ,[Squidward moves his arms and legs around then puts them back down. He mutters in his sleep and all we can understand is the word ""Grandma""], It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. ,[SpongeBob takes the covers off. Squidward is wearing a pink floral top],
,Patrick:, Wait, what's that? ,[SpongeBob takes a red bag out from underneath Squidward. It appears to be a hot water bottle], I think I'm gonna be sick.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
,Patrick:, Stinky.
,SpongeBob:, No, it's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo. ,[Patrick puts flashlight under the so-called ""egg sack"" and SpongeBob's hands are under it],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Twins. ,[Squidward rolls over in his sleep and his right tentacle sticks on Patrick's helmet],
,Patrick:, Pardon my French, but get this thing off me! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick try to get his tentacles off but they wake him up instead],
,Squidward:, Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
,Patrick:, It's awake!
,SpongeBob:, Let's capture the little phony! ,[Squidward screams],
,Squidward:, Get away from me! ,[runs away while SpongeBob and Patrick try to capture him. Outside, Mr. Krabs walks up with his pet worm and notices Squidward's house shaking. SpongeBob and Patrick come out with Squidward captured],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye? ,[laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick point their guns at his head], Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
,SpongeBob:, We don't want your money, moon man! ,[both capture Mr. Krabs and toss him and Squidward into the ship], Look at them squirming around in there.
,Patrick:, Eww, gross.
,SpongeBob:, Well, there's plenty more where those came from. ,[at Boating School],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[grading some of her students' paper], SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late? ,[captured], Whatever this is... ,[inflates herself and has a deep voice], ...it's going on your permanent record! ,[Flats, a woman, and Larry are captured along with all of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick are run out of room in the ship for everyone],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
,SpongeBob:, There's no time for that! Just push harder. ,[Sandy is on her jetpack floating down],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... ,[SpongeBob and Patrick capture her],
,SpongeBob:, Nice try, Sandy.
,Patrick:, Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. ,[laughs],
,Sandy:, Aliens? Is that what this is about? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick throw her into the ship], This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- ,[door is slammed shut],
,SpongeBob:, It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone. ,[both stare at each other and pump their guns], So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
,Patrick:, I didn't even know!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah? Well, I got you now.
,Patrick:, Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's... ,[Patrick catches himself with the gray netting as it turns out he had his gun pointed the wrong way], ...me that's got me!
,SpongeBob:, Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this! ,[ship runs out of gas and stops on the moon], Sandy, I'm back! ,[peeks out the window], Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. ,[sees the Earth], Uh-oh...
,Everyone else:, SpongeBob, we ""aliens"" would like a word with you!

"[The episode opens to Sandy's Treedome with Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick all eating Krabby Patties.],
,Patrick:, Watch this. ,[opens up water helmet to insert Krabby Patties, sucks them into his mouth and burps],
,[Both SpongeBob and Sandy giggle.],
,[SpongeBob reaches for the Krabby Patty but gets stopped by Sandy. Then the same thing happens to Sandy, and they both repeat the same process.],
,SpongeBob:, Mmm-hey!
,Sandy:, Hey!
,SpongeBob:, Hey!
,Sandy:, Hey!
,SpongeBob:, Hey!
,Sandy:, Hey!

,Sandy:, Hiyah, hiyah! Hiyah!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screaming ""hiyah""],
,[They both run at each other and Sandy kicks him in the face, sending SpongeBob into her tree. As SpongeBob falls, a pile of leaves fall down on him, causing SpongeBob to dance out like a leprechaun.],
,SpongeBob:, Isn't it a little early for autumn, Sandy?
,Patrick:, Yeah, it's only, um... ,[looks at his bandage with a clock drawn on it], June o'clock. ,[eats Krabby Patty],
,Sandy:, It ain't autumn! ,[picks up an acorn to sniff], ,[gasps], Oh, my tree is dying!
,Patrick:, ,[hits tree with hatchet], Good, we can use the wood.
,Sandy:, Patrick, stop! I can save it with science.
,Patrick:, Okay. Hmm. ,[throws hatchet at her window, causing it to crack and spew water],
,Sandy:, ,[groans],
,[The scene transitions to Sandy, who appears to be working on her solution for her tree.],
,Sandy:, ,[looks at an old-looking acorn with microscope],
,Acorn:, Feed me!
,Sandy:, Jumpin' beans on a trampoline! You're starvin'! I got to make you the best fertilizer known to critter-kind!
,[Sandy then pours four different solutions for four trees exactly the same. The solution gives them all different reactions.],
,Sandy:, ,[pours first solution on one plant, causing it to burst], ,[gasps then screams], ,[pours second solution to plant, causing a tree branch to form into a human hand, which grabs Sandy by the neck], ,[stabs it with broom, gasps, and pants, she takes out a bottle of growth pills], Ah, growth pills. ,[pours third solution to plant, causing it to expand], Hi! ,[plant blows up in her face], Nuts. ,[opens her desk and pulls out her chemistry set, she takes out a baster with serum in it], Ah-ha! ,[pours last solution on plant, causing it to form into a miniature tree, which grows acorns], Yee-haw!
,[The scene transitions to Sandy who is seen spraying her solution onto her tree.],
,Sandy:, ,[humming cheerfully], Aw, I hope this is the pick-me-up you needed ole' girl. ,[an acorn grows and falls onto Sandy's head], Well, kiss my grits! This here's the biggest acorn I ever did see! ,[more acorns fall, causing a big pile of acorns], And so are those! I'd better start storing these for winter. ,[shoves a whole load of acorns into her mouth], I might need an alternate storage solution.
,[The scene cuts to Sandy, who is trying to push all her food into her storage space, which ends up failing and getting covered with acorns. She then uses her tongue to call SpongeBob.],
,Sandy:, Hey there, SpongeBob? Could you swing by my place?
,[Sandy's tree continues to rain down acorns. Sandy and SpongeBob are in the tree where her room is filled with acorns.],
,Sandy:, I love squirreling away nuts, but this is just too much!
,SpongeBob:, I'd say you've certainly got a real nutmare on your hands.
,[Sandy slaps SpongeBob in the face.],
,Sandy:, Just dump these somewhere! I'm gonna put more under my bed.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, ma'am!
,[The scene changes to SpongeBob in a mythical-looking area, carrying a huge pile of acorns in a wheel barrel. He dumps the acorns over a cliff.],
,Shalmon:, ,[offscreen], Stop!
,[SpongeBob turns around and sees an old fish wearing a red robe and a jellyfish hat, who is pointing his clam staff at him.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa. Who are you?
,Shalmon:, ,[floats down], I am the spirit guide of the salmon people! I am the Shalmon!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey there, Shalmon. Uh, my name is SpongeBob.
,Shalmon:, Why do you dump your nuts on my people's land, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, they're not mine. They're my friend, Sandy's.
,Shalmon:, Allow me to give you some sage advice. You must not squander nature's bounty. Nuts are meant to be eatin'. ,[pulls out his secrets book], It's all in my book.
,[The Shalmon drops his book on SpongeBob, squishing him in the sand. SpongeBob pops out and reads the book.],
,SpongeBob:, Meant to be eatin' eh?
,Shalmon:, Of course! The earth provides our food and we must care for her in return. ,[balances on a rock], It's all about balance, my friend. Look at my garden.
,[SpongeBob looks through his telescope and sees plants growing.],
,SpongeBob:, Wow. It's coming in great.
,[SpongeBob adjusts the telescope to look closer, but ends up seeing armpit hair in the Shalmon's sleeve. SpongeBob laughs in embarrassment and the Shalmon pulls his sleeve back up.],
,Shalmon:, ,[sighs], Over there!
,[SpongeBob looks and sees a much beautiful looking garden with real plants growing.],
,SpongeBob:, Even better!
,[The scene changes to Sandy's tree continuing to rain down acorns. Sandy is storing her nuts in her fridge.],
,Sandy:, So some Shalmon guy told you people would want to eat my nuts and you believe it?
,SpongeBob:, Uh huh. Uh huh. Surely the Shalmon isn't a sham.
,Sandy:, Shertainly not! I mean certainly not! ,[pulls out her cookbook], Let's see what we can cook up. Aged Nut Brie. Ghost Nut Chili. How 'bout Nutty Butter? Seems easy enough to make.
,[Sandy pulls a branch and a huge bundle of acorns rain down. She takes a cleaver and cuts a small amount of acorns she needs to make Nutty Butter. She rolls the acorns into liquid with her log-shaped rolling pin. Then she scoops the liquefied acorns into a bowl and stirs it all up before adding a dash of lard to it. She mixes them together and adds some salt on it. She then tastes the Nutty Butter.],
,Sandy:, Woo-hoo! That's delicious!
,[Sandy gives a handful of Nutty Butter to SpongeBob for him to taste.],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! Patrick would wanna try this.
,Patrick:, ,[arrives at the scene], Try what?
,[Sandy and SpongeBob are startled by Patrick's sudden appearance. Patrick takes a handful of Nutty Butter and rubs it on his stomach.],
,Sandy:, Patrick, that Nutty Butter is for eating.
,Patrick:, I know. ,[takes off his helmet and bites on his stomach], Ow! ,[sucks the butter and bites again], Ow! ,[sucks the butter and bites again], Ow!
,Sandy:, Hmm. Why don't you boys take some for the road?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Thanks!
,[Sandy gives SpongeBob and Patrick two jars full of her Nutty Butter and they leave. Sandy begins to clean up until she hears a knock. She answers and finds that it's Patrick.],
,Patrick:, Can I have some more? ,[points to his back that is smeared by her Nutty Butter], It's hard to eat off this side of me. ,[tries to reach with his tongue but couldn't],
,Sandy:, Sure, Patrick! Here's the last of it!
,[Sandy gives Patrick seven jars full of her Nutty Butter.],
,Patrick:, Thanks, Sandy!
,[The scene changes to Sandy finally getting her tree all cleaned up from the acorns.],
,Sandy:, There. Everything is back to normal. ,[she hears noise outside her treedome], What in tarnation?
,[Sandy walks out of her treedome and sees a crowd of people chanting ""We Want Nutty Butter!"" at her front door. Patrick appears in the crowd.],
,Patrick:, Hey, Sandy!
,Sandy:, Patrick, what's going on here?
,Patrick:, I want more Nutty Butter.
,Sandy:, Who are all these people?
,[The crowd continues to chant.],
,Patrick:, Oh. ,[laughs], They licked the Nutty Butter off my back. ,[Patrick's back is all clean but there is one particle of Nutty Butter leftover. Frankie Billy licks it off his back.], And now they're here for more.
,Sandy:, Aw, gosh Patrick. I don't have enough to feed everyone.
,Abigail Marge:, But it's the only thing my boy will eat!
,Archie:, Guess I'll have to go to bed hungry again.
,[The crowd grumbles in disgust at Sandy's inconsideration.],
,Sandy:, Well, I don't want to let anyone down. I can make some more acorns!
,[The scene changes to Sandy at her booth selling her Nutty Butter to the crowd. SpongeBob helps Sandy by selling the Nutty Butter to the people in the streets and to a worm. Everything was going fantastic until Sandy gives the last jar to the last customer in line while Patrick eats some Nutty Butter from his own jar.],
,Sandy:, Making everyone's day with my Nutty Butter really gives me the warm and tinglies!
,Patrick:, Uh huh.
,Sandy:, In fact, demands have been so high, I scienced up a way to increase my production.
,[Sandy's tree is being conducted by a fertilizer tank she made and it provides more acorns for her to make Nutty Butter.],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, here, scoops acorns onto my conveyor belt. ,[SpongeBob shovels some acorns on the conveyor belt], Then the tubes take them inside ,[the tube sucks up the acorns and Sandy pulls the lever down on her Nutty Butter machine to put some in a jar], where I turn them into Nutty Butter.
,[Sandy's fertilizer tank makes the tree provide more acorns.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reading the Shalmon's book], Sandy, according to the Shalmon's book, we shouldn't try to force nature to give us more than she's able.
,Sandy:, Don't worry about my tree, SpongeBob. Worry about the crowd of Nutty Butter fans outside.
,Crowd:, We want Nutty Butter! We want Nutty Butter!
,Sandy:, We're gonna need a lot more acorns to feed them all.
,[Sandy injects some serum into the root and the tree provides more acorns. She goes outside with her wagon full of Nutty Butter to sell to the crowd, but unbeknownst to her, her tree slowly begins to wilt. SpongeBob shovels more acorns onto the conveyor belt until he notices what's happening to the tree as acorns and dead leaves begin to fall.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh oh. Sandy's tree's not lookin' so good. I don't think it can take much more of this, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Uh. Well, it's like Sandy said, ""Something, something, something, science."" And who are we to argue with science?
,[SpongeBob wasn't so sure about it but he continues shoveling acorns on the conveyor belt. Suddenly, the fertilizer machine stops working and the tree stops making more acorns.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no! The nuts stopped!
,Patrick:, Hold on! I got this!
,[Patrick pokes the tree with his umbrella, but much to his horror, the tree cracks, loses its leaves and inexplicably dies. SpongeBob and Patrick scream.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no! Patrick, we have to do something! Sandy'll never forgive us if we ruined her tree!
,Patrick:, And I'll never forgive her if she runs out of Nutty Butter!
,[SpongeBob tries to fix the tree by stapling some dead leaves on it while Patrick tries to make more Nutty Butter by eating some acorns and spitting them into a bucket. The scene changes to Sandy selling the remaining jars of Nutty Butter to the crowd.],
,Sandy:, Please, please no pushing! I'll make more! Remember, Sandy's the squirrel you can count on!
,[Sandy goes back inside her treedome when she sees her wilted tree, much to her horror.],
,Sandy:, Oh no! What in the Sam Hill is goin' on around here?
,SpongeBob:, The tree got real sick!
,Patrick:, Don't worry. I made more Nutty Butter with the rest of the nuts.
,Sandy:, You used all the nuts? Jumpin' Jiminy! Time for another dose of fertilizer!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, wait! I don't think that's what your tree needs!
,Shalmon:, ,[appears at the top of Sandy's wilted tree], The boy is right! Why do you hurt your tree? The tree would never hurt you. ,[gets pricked by a splinter], Ouch! Dang splinters!
,SpongeBob:, Shalmon?
,Sandy:, Wait, you're the one who said I should feed my nuts to the people?
,Shalmon:, Indeed. But to feed so many from a single tree... Let me share with you a story. Long ago, before fish walked the seas, there lived in the sky one sun.
,[As the Shalmon tells his story, the sun appears in the image of SpongeBob.],
,Sun:, ,[laughs],
,Shalmon:, One star.
,[The star appears in the image of Patrick.],
,Star:, Hello!
,Shalmon:, And one moon.
,[The moon appears in the image of Squidward.],
,Moon:, What the?
,[In the story, the sun plays baseball with the star.],
,Shalmon:, During the day, the star would play with the sun.
,[The star is seen chasing the moon.],
,Shalmon:, At night, the star would play with the moon.
,Moon:, Get away from me!
,[The star spins the moon and throws him.],
,Shalmon:, The star did not want to let his friends down. But he alone could not keep up with both the sun and the moon.
,[The star is seen sleeping as the sun circles around him. The star sleeps on top of the sun but is burned. The sun goes back up in the sky as it changes to night.],
,Moon:, Finally. Some peace.
,Shalmon:, That is when the star had an idea.
,[The star wakes up, buffs up and explodes into millions of stars.],
,Moon:, Hmm? Hmm? Ahh! ,[sees multiple stars], Oh no. There goes the neighborhood.
,[The stars chase the moon.],
,Shalmon:, By creating many copies, the star was able to keep the sun and moon happy without wearing himself out. Do you understand why I tell you this tale?
,[The Shalmon sees Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick sleeping below, meaning that they fell asleep during his story.],
,Shalmon:, Hello? Wake up!
,[Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick wake up.],
,Patrick:, ,[angry], I didn't know there was gonna be a test!
,Sandy:, Oh, I got so wrapped up in not letting anyone down that I asked too much of my tree and my friends.
,Shalmon:, Perhaps with many trees, you can continue serving your community in a natural and sustainable manner. ,[thinks for a second], I mean pretty much anything is better than this mess! Yeesh!
,Sandy:, Thanks, Shammy. But I'm a one tree kind of squirrel. I'm gonna do what I should've done in the first place. Order the ole' girl some nutritious new dirt from Texas!
,[The scene changes to Sandy reviving the tree with some new fertilizer from Texas while SpongeBob and Patrick help her. The Shalmon is watching outside from Sandy's treedome.],
,Shalmon:, Well, my work here is done. It's time I return to my people.

,Patrick:, ,[barely waking up], Time for what?
,SpongeBob:, The big shin-dig! Remember?
,Patrick:, No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today. ,[wiggles his foot],
,SpongeBob:, That's shin dig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship.
,Patrick:, The beach! Just you and me!? ,[SpongeBob rips off his pants showing his swim trunks; Patrick rips off his skin showing his insides], So am I ready for the beach, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine! ,[bubble transition to a bus coming by. SpongeBob and Patrick shove a huge bag of stuff onto it], I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend. ,[shoves his bag onto a seat with someone sitting in the seat. SpongeBob and Patrick both cram themselves on the same seat along with the guy],
,Guy on Bus:, You're hurting me!

,Person in front of him (Harold):, ,[sigh], What?
,SpongeBob:, I'm going to the beach with my best friend! ,[taps the bus driver's shoulder], Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!

,Bus driver:, I don't care.

Patrick! ,[SpongeBob takes out a keyboard guitar, and Patrick takes out an accordion], A few verses of the best friend tune! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick start playing and singing],♪Ohhhh best fr-♪ ,[the bus stops and SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off it], Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are.

,Patrick:, Small plastic disc that you throw! ,[claps], I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!
,SpongeBob:, I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name.
,Patrick:, Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?
,SpongeBob:, Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll ,[winks], toss it to you!
,Patrick:, ,[runs], Ha ha ha ha.
,SpongeBob:, Ready?! ,[throws Frisbee. Patrick is running and laughing. He steps on two people and kicks sand in a guy's sandwich],
,Nat:, Ha ha ha! That's why they call it a sandwich! ,[Patrick kicks sand in his mouth while trying to catch the Frisbee. He almost runs into a pane of glass being carried by two workers. He crashes through an ice cream cart, and then into a lifeguard tower],
,Patrick:, ,[Underneath rubble of the life guard tower, Frisbee lands in his hand], I caught it! ,[Pants], Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?
,Life Guard:, ,[pops out from underneath the tower rubble], I can assure you, that was not cool! Just look at what you've done! Your buffoonery has destroyed the lifeguard tower! Why don't you find something to do that's less obnoxious?
,Patrick:, Like what?
,Life Guard:, I don't know, go play in the sand or something!
,Patrick:, Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring.
,SpongeBob:, Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or...
,Patrick:, Boring, SpongeBob, boring!
,SpongeBob:, I know, we can make sand castles!
,Patrick:, That sounds ,[elbows SpongeBob], un-boring!""
,SpongeBob:, No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle. ,[Laughs. Bubble transition to him constructing a sand castle. SpongeBob talks to the man he has drawn in a window of his castle], Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy? ,[To Patrick], How ya doing over there?
,Patrick:, ,[patting sand], Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over. ,[begins rubbing down Patrick's sand mound],
,Patrick:, Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!
,SpongeBob:, I'm just trying to help, buddy!

,Patrick's Architect:, Here are those architectural plans you requested.
,Patrick:, Why thank you. Here's a little something for you."" ,[hands architect sand money which promptly disintegrates in his hands],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm. ,[to the little man in his sand castle], And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side.
,Patrick:, ,[throws a ball of sand at SpongeBob's castle, destroying it], Now, we're even!
,SpongeBob:, All right, Patrick, have it your way. ,[Draws a line in the sand separating the two of them], ""You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine. ,[mumbles to himself and quickly builds an even larger and better castle],

,SpongeBob:, ,[After seeing Patrick's new castle], I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas. ,[starts building a wall, but then notices that Patrick's castle is over the borderline], Oh, sir, you built onto my side.
,Patrick:, So?
,SpongeBob:, ,[mad], So, you don't do that! ,[chops off the portion of Patrick's castle that is crossing], There! That restores the integrity of our shared border.
,Patrick:, You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for! ,[Builds a hammer out of sand and charges toward SpongeBob's castle],
,SpongeBob:, But what for what!?
,Patrick:, ,[attacks SpongeBob's castle, completely destroying it], Now, we're even... again!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again. ,[builds this huge castle and Patrick does the same.

May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!"" ,[Patrick shoots a sand arrow at SpongeBob's castle], What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?

,SpongeBob:, Oh, is that so!?"" Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on! ,[Patrick laughs and builds an army of knights. SpongeBob clears his throat], Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off.
,Patrick:, No way! You started it.
,SpongeBob:, Fine! Have it your way.
,Patrick:, ,[laughs menacingly], Whatever. ,[SpongeBob is loading a catapult], No no no no no. ,[SpongeBob chops the catapult rope. Patrick screams as the sand rocks from SpongeBob's catapult hurl toward him destroying Patrick's army. SpongeBob laughs and blows another horn. SpongeBob's army emerges from his castle and charges toward Patrick. Patrick screams again. SpongeBob's army starts to ram down the door to Patrick's castle. Patrick panics and builds a cannon. SpongeBob's army breaks the door], Oh hello! And goodbye. ,[pulls cannon's string. SpongeBob's army rushes in his castle away from the cannonball],
,SpongeBob:, Come on! ,[closes the door to his castle], How do you like them apples ,[Cannonball goes over the wall and destroys the army],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs from atop his castle], You'll never win! Do you hear me!?
,SpongeBob:, ,[now inside a high tech sand castle], Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you? ,[Sand constructed general starts to fall apart], Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately! ,[builds a tank that then crashes through his own castle and towards Patrick's], How do you like me now?
,Patrick:, ,[has a robot already built that punches through his own castle], I like you this much! ,[picks up SpongeBob's tank with SpongeBob screaming inside], Feel me!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams again. He presses a button in his tank blowing up Patrick's robot. He emerges from his tank and sees Patrick inside his robot head], Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
,Patrick:, ,[quietly], The question is... will you be!? ,[presses a button in his robot head. The robot flies into the air with SpongeBob still hanging on. SpongeBob looks down and sees how high up he is. He then slips and falls through the sky. Then he pulls a sand parachute and laughs], No fair!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Floating gently down], All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!? ,[presses a sand button. Falls into his jet waiting in midair. SpongeBob presses a button in his jet while chasing Patrick's robot head], Now let's have some real fun! ,[Missiles fly toward Patrick. Patrick screams as he turns his robot away from the missiles],

,Gryphon:, ,[gasps], Let's beat it, dude! ,[He and another gryphon fly away as the bomb explodes. Patrick laughs menacingly. Patrick is interrupted by SpongeBob flying his jet directly toward Patrick. Patrick screams loudly. SpongeBob's jet crashes into Patrick's robot],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laying on the ground in pain], Ohhhh.
,Patrick:, ,[also laying on the ground in pain], Ohhhh. What happened?
,SpongeBob:, I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away.
,Patrick:, Me, too...was it worth it?
,SpongeBob:, No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick hug],
,Lifeguard:, Let's also not forget who's going to clean this place up. ,[camera pans around showing the destruction caused],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Oooh, uhhhh, ahhhh...
,Lifeguard:, ,[gives Patrick a dustpan and hands SpongeBob a broom], Better get started! You've got a lot of work to do.
,Patrick:, I bet I can clean up faster than you!
,SpongeBob:, Oh yeah? I bet you can't!

"[The episodes begins on another beautiful day at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs once again foils another one of Plankton's attempts to steal the secret Krabby Patty formula and carries him outside through the front doors.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!
,[Mr. Krabs kicks Plankton out and sends him flying through the air, over some of the Bikini Bottomites, and lands on the ground. Plankton's landing makes him slide face down and hits Sandy's boot.],
,Sandy:, Hmm? ,[sees Plankton near her boot], Plankton, you look like the cheese that fell off the cracker. I bet you tried to get that formula again.
,Plankton:, ,[spits out sand from his mouth], I don't get it. A crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me!
,[Patrick rides past Sandy and Plankton with his skateboard facing upside down.],
,Sandy:, You should give up that formula. Mr. Krabs would have to be as dumb as Patrick.
,Plankton:, ,[thinks for a second], Yes. ,[gets an idea], Yes he would! As dumb as Patrick! ,[laughs],
,[The scene changes to Plankton riding on a stream of water on a canoe. The stream turned out to be droll of Patrick who is fast asleep under his rock. Plankton canoes into Patrick's mouth. Plankton then puts his helmet on turns on the light.],
,Plankton:, One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it.
,[Plankton takes a cotton swab and dabs on Patrick's cheek to abstract some saliva. Suddenly, a vibration shakes inside Patrick's mouth and his tongue shakes Plankton off.],
,Plankton:, Nagging Neptune! ,[Plankton whacks the tongue with his swab], Back you twisted tongue! You will not lick me!
,[Patrick's tongue turns Plankton around and licks his butt. Plankton shrieks as he finds this gross. Plankton whacks the tongue again with his swab and the tongue falls. Just then, Patrick unexpectedly burps out gases.],
,Plankton:, Sweet gashes molasses!
,[The gases sends Plankton and his canoe flying. Plankton changes the canoe into a plane and flies out of Patrick's mouth. Later, Plankton is seen at the Chum Bucket cooking some sauce on the stove. Karen comes in.],
,Karen:, Oh, pee-yew! What's that awful stench? You're not boiling your underpants again, are you?
,[Laughter is heard.],
,Plankton:, I told you to turn off that laugh track. And if you must know, I made sauce. ,[holds out his swab with Patrick's saliva on it], But when I add Patrick's DNA to it, it'll become Salsa Imbecilicus.
,[An image of Patrick forms on the saliva.],
,Plankton:, Idiot sauce! ,[laughs], I'll serve it to Krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula! Huh? Huh?
,Karen:, I think I'd prefer the boiling underpants. ,[turns on the laugh track], Let me do it. You always make a mess.
,Plankton:, Leave me be woman!
,Karen:, Don't tell me... ,[Plankton turns her off],
,[Karen angrily leaves the kitchen. Plankton laughs evilly as he dips the swab with Patrick's saliva into the sauce. However, the sauce boils a big bubble. Plankton accidentally pops the bubble with the swab and sauce gets splattered onto him.],
,Plankton:, Oh no.
,[Plankton drops the swab into the sauce and he tries to shake the sauce off of himself. However, the sauce caused Plankton's body to become like Patrick's body and Plankton began to act dumb. Plankton plays with his lips as the steam from the sauce goes up the chimney and get absorbed into a cloud. The cloud goes over Bikini Bottom and rains the sauce over the town. Soon, everyone ended up acting as dumb as Patrick. The next day, Sandy comes out of her treedome and notices the townsfolk is acting very strangely and appeared to be dumb as Patrick. She goes to Squidward's house and sees it has a clown wig and a clown nose on it. Squidward is outside his house acting very dumb.],
,Squidward:, I've got the best taste in town! Duh! ,[runs goofily into his house],
,Sandy:, I never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. But this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones.
,[Dave runs around laughing with a cone on his head. He jumps and continues running. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob is on the ground flipping dirt with his spatula. Then he somewhat makes a patty out of the dirt.],
,Sandy:, What happened to your head, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Uh, me make Krabby Patties.
,Sandy:, Uh, that's mud.
,[SpongeBob shoves the dirt into his holes and squeezes them out. He laughs and runs off to a crowd of people surrounding a stop sign. Patrick comes with a yellow balloon and is still riding the skateboard upside down.],
,Sandy:, Hey, Patrick. Have you noticed that everyone's acting a lot like you today?
,[Patrick eats the balloon and it pops inside his mouth which deflates his head. Patrick lifts his head up.],
,Patrick:, I don't understand the question.
,[Patrick leaves and continues riding the skateboard upside down. Sandy sees Mr. Krabs laughing and throwing money everywhere. Mr. Krabs pulls out the bottle containing the secret formula, opens it and eats it. He burps out the formula into dozens of pieces.],
,Sandy:, What in Sam Hill?
,[Sandy sees Mrs. Puff being pushed on her boat upside down by Billy and pretends to drive her boat. Tom is seen wearing the shower curtain and his brushing his back with the scrub brush. Nat Peterson is seen riding his bike sideways on the round while hitting his head against a rock. The several people are chasing a jellyfish who stings them when they touch it.],
,Sandy:, Hey, don't do that!
,[Sandy goes after them until they stopped at the end of a line at the Chum Bucket.],
,Sandy:, Lining up for the Chum Bucket? Now, I know everyone's got a hole in their screen door. This place is ground zero for zero.
,[Sandals knocks on Sandy's helmet and puts his mouth on top.],
,Sandy:, ,[grossed out], Zero as being everyone's collective IQ.
,[The scene changes to Plankton biting his antenna and rolling on the floor in the kitchen of the Chum Bucket. Sandy is seen talking to Karen as she is explaining what's going on.],
,Karen:, And that's how the idiot sauce spread throughout Bikini Bottom. I guess you weren't affected because you were protected by your treedome.
,Sandy:, And you weren't affected because you're a computer. Looks like it's up to us to find a cure for the town's idiocy.
,[Plankton is banging his head against the mirror.],
,Plankton:, You not Plankton! Me Plankton! ,[bangs his head against the mirror],
,Karen:, We need to snap him out of this. What's the opposite of dim?
,Sandy:, Bright.
,[Karen and Sandy turn on a lamp to try to snap Plankton out of his stupidity but nothing works.],
,Karen:, It's not working! Maybe we can feed him something for brain food. You're smart. What do you eat?
,[Plankton gets to close to the light bulb and burns his eye.],
,Sandy:, Nuts?
,[The scene changes to Sandy stuffing Plankton's mouth with acorns, but nothing's working.],
,Sandy:, Oh, it doesn't seem to be working. You know him. How do you get him to change? 
,Karen:, I usually just yell at him. Get smart, dummy!
,Sandy:, Wise up!
,Karen:, Be clever, idiot!
,Sandy:, No things!
,[Nothing is working as Plankton laughs and claps like a seal.],
,Karen:, ,[sighs], It's no use. Being smart takes work.
,Sandy:, ,[thinks a second], That gives me an idea.
,[The scene changes to Sandy and Karen standing at the front doors of a school called Bikini Bottom University.],
,Sandy:, Come one, come all to Bikini Bottom University! A free education for all! There's no more excuse for being a dope! Step right up all you morons! Classes are now beginning!
,[But the Bikini Bottomites were so dumb, they didn't listen and continued to walk around stupidly.],
,Sandy:, Aww! This isn't working!
,Karen:, Try jiggling the keys!
,[Sandy pulls the rope and jiggles the keys. The Bikini Bottomites see the keys and goes in. Later, Karen and Sandy are in a classroom.],
,Sandy:, Good mornin', students.
,[The students continue to act stupid when they are in their desks.],
,Sandy:, A whole school full of Patricks? Looks like we've got our work cut out for us.
,[The scene changes to Sandy teaching Jimmy Gus how to put on pants. She gives him a demonstration. Jimmy chews on the pants, but realizes it's not something to eat. Jimmy puts his pants on backwards, but Sandy gives him a thumbs-up. In doing so, the point on Jimmy's head gets smaller. Karen is in the other classroom teaching the students how to eat. She demonstrates on how to eat with a spoon. Frank flips some food at Tom with the spoon and Debbie Rechid dips her head in the food. Nat Peterson seems to get it and ate the food with the spoon. The point on Nat's head gets smaller. In another classroom called Home EC, Mr. Krabs is attempting to make a Krabby Patty. He makes it, but it has the carton of milk in the middle and the patty is on top of the bun. Mr. Krabs eats the patty along with the milk carton and the plate. Karen seemed unsure if that was ok, but gives Mr. Krabs a thumbs up.],
,French Narrator:, One semester later...
,[All of the Bikini Bottomites, who have now returned to their normal selves after a long semester, leave the classroom.],
,Sandy:, And don't forget your last homework assignment!
,Karen:, Looks like we were able to educate the whole town in one semester!
,Sandy:, Yep! Day after tomorrow is graduation! And everybody learned so well.
,Karen:, Everybody but one.
,[Plankton is still acting stupid though somewhat smarter and becomes a school bully and is writing on the locker doors with a pen.],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Yeah!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[reading], ""Skool iz dum""? You misspelled every word.
,Plankton:, ,[angrily], Shut up, dweeb!

,Plankton:, Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?
,[Mr. Krabs picks up his books.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!
,[Mr. Krabs runs off crying.],
,Plankton:, I know you're cookin' up something special in Home EC, Eugene! I want that formula!

,Plankton:, Did you finish my homework for me, nerd?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,[SpongeBob pushes Plankton's homework out from the holes of the locker door. Plankton opens on the door and SpongeBob comes out.],
,SpongeBob:, You know, you really ought to do your own homework. It's the only way you'll learn.

,[All of the Bikini Bottomites are in their cap and gown and is having a graduation ceremony for attending the university.],
,Sandy:, This is a proud day for everyone in Bikini Bottom! And as a treat, Squidward will play Pomp and Circumstance on the clarinet.
,[Squidward begins playing Pomp and Circumstance, but ends up playing the wrong notes which aggravates the crowd. Meanwhile, in Home EC, Mr. Krabs is busy making a Krabby Patty.],
,SpongeBob:, Hurry up, Mr. Krabs. They're handing out the diplomas.
,Mr. Krabs:, Just a minute. I think I've perfected the Krabby Patty formula! ,[takes a bite of the patty and it tastes good], Yes! That's it!
,SpongeBob:, Great! Well, see ya out there.
,[SpongeBob leaves and Plankton enters the classroom.],
,Plankton:, Somethin' smells good!
,[Mr. Krabs finishes writing the formula but when he sees Plankton, he hides it in his graduation gown.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! P...P...Plankton? What are you doin' here?
,Plankton:, It's the last day of school, baby. No need to be formal. Call me Sheldon. ,[takes a bite of the patty], Great Neptune! That's perfection! Well, with this recipe, I could own the most popular fast food restaurant in Bikini Bottom!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[frightened], No, please! Not that! Anything but that!
,Plankton:, Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!
,[Meanwhile at the graduation ceremony, all of the Bikini Bottomites throw their caps in the air and have become graduates of the Bikini Bottom University.],
,Karen:, Congratulations, SpongeBob! You're smart now! It's funny that Mr. Krabs never showed up to get his diploma.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. The only two people who didn't show up are Mr. Krabs and Plankton. ,[gasps], Let me have that diploma!
,[SpongeBob grabs the diploma, takes of his cap and gown and runs across the hallway.],
,Patrick:, Uh, hey. No running in the halls!
,[SpongeBob runs slowly. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is cornered by Plankton and he reluctantly gives the formula to him.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Here you go, Plankton.
,[All of a sudden, SpongeBob bursts in the classroom.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, your diploma!
,[SpongeBob throws the diploma and Mr. Krabs catches it, preventing him from giving the formula to Plankton.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks to this here diploma, I'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula!
,Plankton:, What?! If I knew education worked like that, I would have bought a diploma years ago!
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead! I took  accelerated classes and graduated months ago! This diploma is just a formality!
,Plankton:, But... but you were just about to give me the formula! Y..You were scared of me!
,[Sandy turns on a light from behind the chalkboard.],
,Sandy:, Excellent, Mr. Krabs! ,[writes a grade for Mr. Krabs], Here's your final grade for acting class. A+. ,[gives Mr. Krabs his grade], I've really felt the fear.
,Plankton:, Wait, what?! Acting class?! ,[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton], No!
,Mr. Krabs:, You've finally been schooled, drop-out!
,[Mr. Krabs stuffs Plankton in his diploma and blows him out the window. Plankton was sent flying onto Karen's computer screen where she turns on the laugh track.],

,SpongeBob:, Three bags of snail chow. Four bags of snail litter.

,Sadie:, Thanks, Snailguy!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, you're welcome?
,[More people gives SpongeBob their snails, though SpongeBob looks a bit overwhelmed by having so much snails. When SpongeBob enters the house, dozens of snails crowd the living room when SpongeBob carries bowls of food.],
,SpongeBob:, Ok, would you guys just relax? You're all gonna get fed. Donnie, keep out of Walter's dish. Obulax, what are you doing? Cheryl, Henry, no fighting.
,[SpongeBob notices his clothes are covered in snail slime while a snail slithers on his head.],
,SpongeBob:, Geez, my pants are getting ruined and my head is sticky. I gotta do something about that.
,[SpongeBob goes up to his bathroom, removes the snail from his head and takes off his pants. He then takes the shower curtain and puts it on like he's wearing a dress. Then he takes a bathmat and makes it into a hairpiece. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab where there is a line of hungry customers who are complaining about not getting their food.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, why aren't you taking orders from these good people?
,Squidward:, I would, but what's the point? There's no one to make the food.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stutters], What?! Where's SpongeBob?
,Squidward:, Let me think. No idea.
,Mr. Krabs:, Then you'll have to do SpongeBob's job too!
,Squidward:, I can't do that!
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course you can. Any idiot can do it. Now, get to work! I'm gonna go find SpongeBob!
,[Mr. Krabs leaves the Krusty Krab to find SpongeBob. The customers continue to complain.],
,Squidward:, Alright, alright! Calm down, everybody! I'm here to take your order!
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs knocking on SpongeBob's door. SpongeBob, who now appears with an eerie looking face, answers.],
,SpongeBob:, Yes?
,[Mr. Krabs becomes smitten when he thinks SpongeBob is a woman.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, excuse me, me lovely. Maybe I've got the wrong house here. But I can't say I'm disappointed. I was thinkin' of me old matey SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs.
,[Mr. Krabs is stunned.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stutters], SpongeBob? That's you, boy? Why aren't you at work? And why are you all dressed up like a eye poppin' south sea hula gal?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. But I'm so busy taking care of these snails. I'll try to come in tomorrow.
,Mr. Krabs:, You try?! Listen up, me boy-oh! You'll do more than try! You'll...!
,[A noise is heard inside of SpongeBob's house.],
,SpongeBob:, Down, Vince! You leave Electric Ronnie alone! Mr. Buster, get off that shelf! Nothing today, thank you! Bye, Mr. Krabs!
,[SpongeBob shuts the door and Mr. Krabs is completely speechless about what SpongeBob's been going through. The scene changes to Squidward coming home from work.],
,Squidward:, ,[sniff], I can't believe that I had to do my job's and SpongeBob's. ,[sneezes as he enters his house],
,French Narrator:, The next morning...
,[Squidward exits his house and his face is completely swollen. He steps on some of the snail slime.],
,Squidward:, What the? ,[notices the slime and sneeze], Oh, it's not a cold, it's my allergies.
,[A snail slithers by and Squidward sees SpongeBob feeding numerous snails. Squidward angrily walks up to SpongeBob.],
,Squidward:, Hey, lady!
,[SpongeBob appears more eerie than before.],
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,Squidward:, ,[freaks out], SpongeBob, is that you?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. ,[gives a bowl of food to a snail],
,Squidward:, What happened to you? And where did all these snails come from?!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry. I'm taking very good care of all my snails. ,[gives a bowl of food to another snail],
,Squidward:, I'm not worried about them, I'm worried about me! I'm allergic to snails!
,SpongeBob:, Even Gary? ,[gives a bowl of food to another snail, but ended up hitting Squidward's stomach.],
,Squidward:, One snail I can handle. Maybe even two or three. But this? Geesh, no way! Just how many snails do you have?

,SpongeBob:, Work? But I've found my life's work. Taking care of wayward snails. ,[a snail crawls over his body.],
,Squidward:, ,[furious], That's it! I'm calling the Bikini Bottom officials so they can deal with it!
,[Squidward stomps away, angrily, and the scene changes to Squidward, with his head more swollen and larger, on the telephone.],
,Squidward:, He said like two hundred and fifty-eight! Well, do something about it! That's why I pay taxes! ,[hangs up the phone.], Oh, my allergies are killing me.
,Harold:, Uh, hello? Hey, man. I'm super hungry. Where's my food, dude?
,Squidward:, Oh, chill your gills! I'll get your food, dude!
,[Squidward reaches over the window and gives Harold his food, but sneezes in it. The food is covered with saliva, which makes Harold grossed out.],
,Harold:, Uh, I'm not so super hungry all of a sudden. And also, I'm super not paying!
,[Harold drops the tray and walks away.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Squidward, have you lost your ever lovin' mind? You cannot be sneezin' all over me Krabby Patties! The customers don't like it. Except for that guy.
,[Sheldon is seen eating the saliva covered Krabby Patties and giggles.],
,Squidward:, That's it. I'm done.
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't abandon ship! I have to work all by meself!
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Don't worry, it's not a problem! Any idiot can do it, right?
,[Squidward leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, Right.
,[The scene changes to Patrick walking to SpongeBob's house with some glue, paper towel rolls, and a snail shell.],
,Patrick:, Well, if it's snail friends he wants, it's a snail friend he's gonna get.
,[Patrick puts paper towel rolls on his eyes to look like snail's eyestalks. Then he glues the snail shell on his back and hides his arms and legs in the shell.],
,Patrick:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, another little stray friend. What is your name little fellow?
,Patrick:, It's Patrick! Um, Meow!
,SpongeBob:, I think I'll call you Patrick.
,[SpongeBob brings Patrick inside his house, but much to Patrick's horror, the house is completely covered with snails, who are spreading slime all over the place. Patrick tries to flee.],
,SpongeBob:, No, no, you dirty boy. You need a bath.
,Patrick:, Meow, no! No, meow!
,[SpongeBob pulls Patrick back in. The scene changes to the Pet Control Police knocking on SpongeBob's door.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, hello, police.
,Pet Control Police:, Excuse me, ma'am. But we've had some complaints...
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], No, thank you, please. ,[Patrick attempts to leave the house but SpongeBob grabs him.], Oh no, Patrick. No outsidies for you. ,[SpongeBob drags him back in.],
,Patrick:, Meow, help! Meow, help! ,[SpongeBob closes the door],
,[The scene changes to Squidward on the telephone with his body incredibly swollen.],
,Squidward:, He said, ""No, thank you, please""? What does that even mean? I demand that you do something about those snails, now!
,[As he talks, his head gets bigger and the receiver gets absorbed by it as well as getting his hand stuck. When Squidward tried to hang up the phone, he struggles to free his hand from his head. He then walks over to his window as his telephone flies off the table and lands in his head. Then sees the freakishly eerie SpongeBob building a fence around his house.],
,Squidward:, Oh, this has got to stop!
,[The telephone rings. Squidward struggles to answer while his hand is still stuck in his swollen head, but falls on the floor. The scene changes to SpongeBob locking the fence.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, the bad men want to take you away from me. But I won't let them.
,[Just then, sirens were heard and two vehicles are arriving. SpongeBob panics, hides Señor Poopus under his dress, and attempts to run but trips over a snail and gets sand in his face and mouth. His face resembles Quasimodo.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Gets up and talks with his mouth full of sand.], Sanctuary! Sanctuary! ,[the snails meow in exclaim], Everybody in! Everybody in!
,[All of the snails rush inside SpongeBob's house, but it was so full that some of the snails flew out from the roof. But SpongeBob manages to get inside his house. One of the vehicles had a truck that is named Bob Barnacle Snail Center on it and the driver of the truck, Bob Barnacle, steps out of it.],
,Pet Control Police:, SpongeBob is behind that fence and he has locked the gate.
,Squidward:, ,[bloated, walks up agitated], Oh, quit messin' around and just break down the gate!
,Bob Barnacle:, ,[calmly], Wait. Maybe there's another way. Get me a bullhorn. I wanna talk to her.
,Pet Control Police:, Him.
,Bob Barnacle:, Oh, right. Him. ,[The Pet Control Police gives Bob a bullhorn and begins talking through it.], SpongeBob, I need you to listen to me!
,[The snails on the roof form a chain and shows the freakishly eerie SpongeBob.],
,SpongeBob:, Hello.
,Bob Barnacle:, SpongeBob, my name is Bob Barnacle. I run the Bob Barnacle Snail Rescue Center. These snails all got loose through a hole in the fence of my snail center. I'm here to help the snails. I'm here to help you.
,SpongeBob:, Hello.
,Bob Barnacle:, I know that you mean well, but there's only so much one sponge can do. You must be very tired from all your hard work.
,[SpongeBob begins to understand what Bob is talking about and regains his senses.],
,Bob Barnacle:, My center has all the space and staff that a snail needs. They'll be well taken care of.
,[The snails gently puts SpongeBob down on the ground. SpongeBob walks to the gate.],
,Bob Barnacle:, I promise. The snails will be happy.
,[SpongeBob unlocks the gate and gives Señor Poopus to Bob.],
,Bob Barnacle:, Esmerelda!
,SpongeBob:, Esmerelda?
,Bob Barnacle:, Yes, that's her name! What did you call her?
,SpongeBob:, ,[embarrassed], Señor Poopus. ,[laughs],
,[The scene changes to all the snails being placed in Bob's truck.],
,SpongeBob:, So long! I'm gonna miss you guys. Especially you, Señor Poopus. ,[laughs], I mean Señorita Esmerelda.
,[Bob puts the last two snails inside his truck.],
,Bob Barnacle:, You did the right thing. You can visit the snail center anytime.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Bob. We will. But I'm going back to being a one snail guy. That's the way I like it.
,Gary:, Meow.
,Bob Barnacle:, Don't forget to get your pet spayed or neutered.
,[Bob enters his truck. But before he drives away, a pink snail slithers up to SpongeBob.],
,Patrick:, Bye, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Patrick.
,[Bob drives away, but SpongeBob realizes that the pink snail was Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Patrick! Patrick! ,[SpongeBob starts chasing after the truck.], Don't worry! I'm going to adopt you!

,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, that one! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick stand up], Now quit saying that! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick frown], It's a bad word!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Bad word?! ,[both start wiping their tongues while moaning],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
,Squidward:, Don't you mean there are only 7?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not if you're a sailor. ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, 13.

,Mr. Krabs:, Yes?!

Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. ,[walks back in Krusty Krab],
,Patrick:, What's going to happen to us?
,SpongeBob:, We'll probably get 40 lashes!
,Patrick:, Oh, no! ,[stupidly imagines himself blinking with 40 thick eyelashes],
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
,Patrick:, I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.
,Patrick:, ,[shakes hands with SpongeBob], Agreed!
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, you two foul mouths.

,Mr. Krabs:, Not again... ,[gets kicked out of the Bank again], ,[screams and crashes into a cliff], Scallops!
,[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs entering the Bank again disguised as a woman],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks by Officer John and Nat Peterson, speaking in a feminine voice], Good day, gentlemen!
,Officer John and Nat Peterson:, Good day, ma'am!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[walks up to Nancy Suzy Fish again], Hello,  young missy!
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Well, hello, ma'am. How can we help you today?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in his thoughts], So far so good...
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Ma'am?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in his thoughts], They haven't thrown me out yet...
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Ma'am? ,[Reaches over to the button and is preparing to press it],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in his thoughts], It's all coming together now...
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Can I help you, ma'am? A withdraw? A transfer? Anything!? Free interest!?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yes! I'll have that please!
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Okay, but you'll have to make a deposit first.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, of course! ,[takes out a penny], Here's me prized penny deposit it into a new account!
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Okay! I'll set it right up! ,[pulls out a drawer],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in his regular voice], Wait! ,[back in his feminine voice], Uh, what you're doing? Penny doesn't want to be crammed in there with all those other coins. She wants a money condo of her own!
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Okay. You want a safe deposit box then?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yes! Penny will have one of those!
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Uh, this way please. ,[leads Mr. Krabs to a bunch other safe deposit boxes. She then is about to open one of the boxes to put his penny in],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait! Can it...have one moment with me penny? Alone?
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, ,[sighs], Make it quick. We're closing in five minutes. ,[walks off],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, penny...I'll miss...,[sniffles and starts crying], It's inhuman I tell ya! Penny, penny...one last kiss goodbye. ,[gets into the safe deposit box and his female clothes falls to the ground. He goes back to using his regular voice.], It's just you and me now little penny! It's a wee bit cramped in here!
,Nat Peterson:, ,[walks by and notices the box open], Oh, well that looks secure...,[closes the box and Mr. Krabs goes flying into the safe. Nat then locks the box], Were you people trained in a barn? ,[walks off],
,Mr. Krabs:, Gasp! This can't be true! ,[picks up some money and starts to sniff them. He then actually sniffs off the hair on one of them], 'Tis true! I landed in money nirvana! ,[jumps up], Me wildest dreams finally come true! ,[laughs and lands in the pile of money. The scene changes over to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I'm done watering down the ketchup. Do you want me to...,[looks and sees that Mr. Krabs isn't in his office], Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? MR. KRABS!
,Squidward:, Would you pipe down!?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward! I can't find Mr. Krabs and he said he'd be right back! I'm getting a little concerned...
,Squidward:, That's nice...and...interesting...
,SpongeBob:, I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him! ,[runs out of the Krusty Krab], Hold on, Krabs! I'm coming for ya! ,[walks near a Bus Stop], Mr. Krabs! ,[walks through an open field], Mr. Krabs! ,[walks past the Hospital], Mr. Krabs! ,[walks by the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank], Mr. Krabs! ,[walks away and the scene changes back over to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, time to head home! ,[slides down a bunch of money], Whoo hoo! I hope to see each and every one of ya on the outside! ,[tries to climb up the hole and get out but the door is locked], Blimey, I'm locked in! ,[climbs back out the hole], I guess I'm trapped here all night! ,[jumps on a pile of money], With all of this moolah! Such much moolah... ,[grabs a bill and blows on it], I have no one to tell about it! Time to rustle up me some friends!
,[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house],
,SpongeBob:, ,[knocks on the door until Pearl opens it], Oh, hi Pearl! Is Mr. Krabs here?
,Pearl:, No.
,SpongeBob:, Pearl, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Mr. Krabs is missing!
,Pearl:, ,[sarcastically], Oh my gosh.
,SpongeBob:, I know!
,Pearl:, Oh, my, gosh.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry! I'll find him!
,Pearl:, ,[agitated], Oh my gosh! ,[hands SpongeBob her cell phone], Call him on my cell! ,[slams the door and the scene changes back over to the Bank],
,Mr. Krabs:, You look absolutely stunning tonight, Mrs. Greenback. Waiter! ,[snaps fingers] [speaks as waiter], Oui, oui, monsieur, what can I get you and zee lady tonight? ,[back to regular speaking], The lady would like to start with a million clams. A side of investments, and hold the taxes. I'll have the same. But with extra no taxes. Eh. Such a friendly fella. Good lookin' too. I'm almost gonna regret not giving him a tip. ,[cell phone rings], Hello?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's nice.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, and she's made entirely out of money.
,SpongeBob:, What? Where are you?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose me mind.
,SpongeBob:, I gotta save Mr. Krabs! ,[runs to Patrick's house], Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank! ,Patrick stops drinking his water, gags, and spits it back on SpongeBob,
,Patrick:, What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. Breaking into a bank? ,[SpongeBob looks ashamed], Has to be the coolest!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[at the bank], Ah. This is the life. ,[imagines a beach], Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Eh, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just… eh. Heh heh. So hungry.
,SpongeBob:, ,[outside the bank], Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?
,Patrick:, Okay. First we climb up the walls. ,[points up], Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall.
,Patrick:, Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Um. How about this? ,[holds out several shoelaces],
,SpongeBob:, A bunch of old shoelaces?
,Patrick:, It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes.
,SpongeBob:, I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do. ,[throws shoelaces up, they catch a pipe, and hold. The shoelaces continue to untie, and SpongeBob jumps to catch each one],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook! ,[throws the grappling hook up, it catches. SpongeBob climbs up, while Patrick piggybacks. They tiptoe across the roof],
,SpongeBob:, This vent will surely lead us to Mr. Krabs!
,Patrick:, Let's get him! ,[the two jump into the vent, and bump all around the bank, then underground, and then through another building. They land on the ground in front of the bank.], COOL! Let's do that again!
,SpongeBob:, Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[inside the imaginary island, it's on fire], Ohhh! So hungry! ,[stomach growls], Oh, why did I come to this uninhabitable island? Why did I do it? Why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her… why isn't she? Miss Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done? ,[sees Greenback on the beach], Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback. ,[picks her up], You're okay! I was so worried. ,[mumbles, and rubs Greenback. As he rubs, all the money composing Mrs. Greenback flies away], What's this?! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?! ,[sees money dragon], A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight! ,[attacks, and comes back to the real vault, shows he is attacking a a vacuum cleaner], Gimme back Mrs. Greenback you beast!
,SpongeBob:, ,[outside the front doors to the bank], Patrick, you ready?
,Patrick:, This lock won't know what hit it! ,[sticks screwdriver into the lock],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse.
,Patrick:, Oh, right! ,[pulls out a crowbar], I'll use the finesse. ,[swings, and SpongeBob ducks. Closed signs switches to open, and they fall through the doors to the foot of the bank manger and night switches to day],
,Bank Manager:, Good morning, gentlemen. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream],
,Patrick:, We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!
,Bank Manager:, What's all this about? ,[walks backwards to alarm button, SpongeBob pulls off ski mask.], May I help you with anything, sir?
,SpongeBob:, Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mister Krabs!
,Bank Manager:, I assure you, Mr. SquarePants, we've received no such deposit. ,[opens vault],
,Mr. Krabs:, I got you now, money sucker! That does it, Lizard-breath! It's you or me, now! Just you and me! ,[wrestles the vacuum, and breaks it. Laughs evilly], I concurred the money dragon! Victory! Woo!
,Bank Manger:, Security! ,[security throws them out], And don't forget your… eh… deposit. ,[tosses penny at Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?
,SpongeBob:, That you can't put a price on freedom?
,Mr. Krabs:, Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit! ,[shakes fist], Hey, you cheapskates! Gimme me interest! ,[penny is thrown at Mr. Krabs], Well. What do you know? I doubled me money. ,[laughs as the episode ends],

"[A humanized pink starfish in a suit walks up and knocks on Patrick's rock.],
,Patrick:, Yeah?
,Starfish:, Good day, sir. I am...
,Patrick:, ,[gasp], I know exactly who you are! ,[closes rock],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gare-Gare.
,Lady on TV:, Jason, I have to be honest. There's someone else. ,[grabs an elderly fish],
,Man on TV:, Grandpa!
,Patrick:, ,[pokes head out of TV], SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time! ,[pants. Makes a fire in SpongeBob's living room and burns some of his books],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what are you doing?
,Patrick:, I have to get rid of these books! ,[shows 'HOW TO READ' book],
,SpongeBob:, Why?
,Patrick:, I'll show you why. ,[shoves SpongeBob's face into his window looking at the pink starfish], See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books. ,[SpongeBob gasps], Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means...
,SpongeBob:, Small portion meals?
,Patrick:, Exactly! ,[crying],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man. ,[later, SpongeBob approaches the starfish outside], Hi there.
,Starfish:, Salutations, young one. Say, you wouldn't happen to know that starfish that lives under this rock, would you?
,SpongeBob:, Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this ""alleged"" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books. ,[SpongeBob slams his hands over his mouth],
,Starfish:, ,[chuckles], Well, it's too bad you don't know Patrick Star, because I am from the Royal Ministry, and have a gift for him. ,[takes out a crown],
,Patrick:, ,[runs through SpongeBob's wall], Ooh, what is it? ,[takes it and tries to bite and lick it], This is the worst-tasting gift ever!
,Starfish:, That's because you're suppose to wear it, not eat it. Allow me to show you something. ,[the starfish searches around in his pants], Let's see here. Aha! What I hold in my hands is a family tree that goes back centuries. It starts with the marriage of King Amoeba and Queen Mildew. Then, through a few inbred generations, ends at you, Sir Patrick, which makes you a descendant of royalty. You are a king. And now it's time I adjourn to the Royal Ministry, where I should be at your service. Your Highness. ,[the starfish bows and leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Patrick, that's great!
,Patrick:, What is?
,SpongeBob:, That you're king!
,Patrick:, What's a king?
,SpongeBob:, When you're a king, you can get anything you want.
,Patrick:, Anything I want? ,[stomach grumbles], SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?
,SpongeBob:, Your wish is my command, your majesty. ,[laughing. Cut to Krusty Krab where SpongeBob enters with medieval clothes on], Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king. ,[Patrick enters, wearing his crown and a royal cloak],
,Patrick:, King needs food badly.
,Mr. Krabs:, What's this all ab... ,[gasps. Sees Patrick's crown and dollar signs appear in his eyes], Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?
,SpongeBob:, The king would like...
,Mr. Krabs:, Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.
,Patrick:, I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...
,Mr. Krabs:, I've got a better idea. ,[cut to a bunch of food on the table and Patrick chewing loudly], A buffet fit for a king.
,Patrick:, ,[belches], Tasty.
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.
,Patrick:, Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[holds a check], How about you pay the check, instead?
,Patrick:, Oh, sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free.
,Mr. Krabs:, All free?!!? ,[kicks them out], Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king! ,[Harold walks out with a drink and Krabby Patty],
,Patrick:, Are you gonna eat that?
,Harold:, I was planning to, why?
,Patrick:, I want it. ,[takes them],
,Harold:, Hey! What gives you the right to take my food?
,Patrick:, ,[eats the Krabby Patty], Tell him, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about.
,Patrick:, I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you.
,Patrick:, Good! Now tell him.
,SpongeBob:, Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants. ,[chuckles],
,Harold:, This isn't fair. ,[walks off],
,Patrick:, Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.
,Fish:, I finally did it! At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition. Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete. Mom's gonna be so proud of me. ,[bumps into Patrick],
,Patrick:, No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!
,Fish:, But, I've spent my entire life collecting those.
,Patrick:, Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!
,Fish:, I will cry about it. ,[crying], I'll cry right to my mom! ,[runs off, cries],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], I love being king.
,[Cut to the jewelery store where the owner is examining a diamond. SpongeBob then shows him the decree and he gives it to Patrick, who puts it in his belly button. Then, SpongeBob takes some lollipops from some kids and Patrick starts licking them. Then SpongeBob shows the decree to Martha Smith, who sadly gives her baby to Patrick, who then takes out the baby's dummy and gives the wailing baby back to her. Then Patrick takes a plunger, a toaster, and dentures. Soon, a long line of people are standing with things to give to Patrick in front of his rock, which now has a castle tower fixed to it],
,SpongeBob:, Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker.
,Old Man Jenkins:, I hope so. Neptune knows I did. ,[falls over], Oof!
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sire?
,Patrick:, ,[slurping a drink and reading a magazine], I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool? ,[cut to Squidward sleeping then waking up to birds chirping and the sun shining],
,Squidward:, Hello, sunshine. ,[chuckles then yawns as he walks over to his window], What a beautiful morning. Just perfect. ,[Squidward falls over from side to side in his house. Patrick is using a crane to move Squidward's house out of the way],
,Patrick:, Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good. ,[crane drops the house], Perfect. ,[Squidward climbs out of his upstairs window],
,Squidward:, ,[stuttering], My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh? ,[he sees SpongeBob and Patrick. He growls their names], SpongeBob, Patrick.[explodes] What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.
,Patrick:, Your front yard?
,SpongeBob:, Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel.
,Squidward:, Ferris Wheel?!
,SpongeBob:, I know, isn't it great?
,Squidward:, No, it's not great! It's horrible. Oh, that's it. Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?
,Patrick:, ,[looking stupidly], Uh...
,Squidward:, ,[Rushes to a worker, on his knees, and grabs his shirt.],You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything? ,[Patrick puts his hand in his mouth.], King of Morons, maybe.
,Worker:, He might be on to something.
,Squidward:, Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See? ,[Squidward then notices that the crowd willingly agrees.],
,Crowd:, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
,Man:, Why are we giving this guy all our stuff? ,[The crowd angrily walks away.],
,Squidward:, See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so, ,[long pause], too!
,Patrick:, ,[enraged], Get him! Attack! Attack! ,[panting with Squidward giving a confused facial expression.], SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!
,SpongeBob:, Uh, right away, your majesty. ,[SpongeBob rushes towards Squidward.], Umm, Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[gritting his teeth], What?
,SpongeBob:, Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?
,Squidward:, ,[takes decree], Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty! ,[As he rolls it up and shoves it onto SpongeBob's face. Cut to inside Patrick's castle where SpongeBob has the treaty stuck in his forehead.],
,Patrick:, ,[rage takes over], My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his! ,[crackling, bangs],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what's happened to you?
,Patrick:, I don't know what you mean.
,SpongeBob:, Uh... ,[laughs], You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and...
,Patrick:, And what...
,SpongeBob:, ,[intimidated of Patrick's rage], Um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk.
,Patrick:, Huh? ,[laughs], I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.
,SpongeBob:, Uh...well, I...
,Patrick:, ,[explodes], Who's saying I'm abusing my power!? ,[SpongeBob shrinks and Patrick rips off his cloak], I'll put the whole town in prison! ,[SpongeBob runs away], Questioning my authority is treason! All these giggly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob? ,[claps twice], SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself! ,[walks by the mirror, and his reflection looks like a monster],
,Mirror:, Knock knock.
,Patrick:, Huh? ,[gasps], A knock knock joke! ,[he runs back to the mirror], Who's there?
,Mirror:, You.
,Patrick and Mirror:, I don't get it.
,Mirror:, I'm you and you are me. ,[a wire in Patrick's head connects and short circuits],
,Patrick and Mirror:, ,[screams], What have I become?! ,[Patrick races out of his rock],
,Patrick:, Aaah, help! Monster! Monster! ,[he bumps into the Royal Ministry starfish], Huh? Oh, it's, it's you! ,[he thrusts the crown at the starfish], Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.
,Starfish:, Oh, I think I know what's going on here. Patrick, with great power comes great responsibility. ,[Patrick is shaking and whimpering], You haven't a clue what I just told you, do you?
,Patrick:, No. Uh-uh.
,Starfish:, Oh, just as well. I've come to take the crown back, as it seems that you aren't royalty after all.
,Patrick:, Huh?
,Starfish:, ,[takes out family history], I've discovered this coffee stain, which upon removal, reveals that Sir Gary is the true heir to the king's crown. ,[he removes the stain to show Gary's picture on the family history parchment. Cut to Gary having a crown put on his head, SpongeBob and Patrick dressed in medieval clothes],
,SpongeBob:, Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!
,Gary:, ,[smiles], Meow?

,TV announcer:, The day you've been waiting for is almost here. That's right. Glove World! has a new ride. It's big... ,[roller coaster goes above the water then back down into it],
,TV announcer:, It's fast... ,[Nancy and Harold are riding a roller coaster so fast, Harold flies off of it],
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, Harold, no!
,TV announcer:, It's painful... ,[roller coaster crashes into the ground, causing an explosion],
,TV announcer:, It's the ""Fiery Fist O' Pain."" Opening tomorrow only at Glove World!

,SpongeBob:, Glove World! Roller coaster. First in line. ,[SpongeBob dreams of him and Patrick at Glove World!. When they walk past the popcorn stand, it turns into a maggot stand and smoke fills the air],
,SpongeBob:, Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain? ,[Grim reaper points to his left. SpongeBob and Patrick float over to the ride. When they get in it, it goes up above the water. They scream as it goes down. Lightning strikes the tracks, and makes the roller coaster fly off the track],
,SpongeBob:, In the name of amusement, no...! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick fall out of the coaster and into graves with their names on the tombstones. A digger puts all the dirt back in the hole],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain! ,[cut to next morning when SpongeBob's alarm goes off but he didn't sleep the whole night. Patrick appears by his bed],
,Patrick:, You ready to ride the Fist O' Pain?
,SpongeBob:, No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night.
,Patrick:, Really? Me too!
,SpongeBob:, What was your dream about, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Oh, look, the bus is here! ,[runs toward the bus],
,SpongeBob:, Wait for me, Patrick. ,[both get on the bus], Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come.

,SpongeBob:, Yeah, really fun. ,[bus stops at Glove World! and SpongeBob & Patrick get off],
,SpongeBob:, That sure looks like fun.
,Patrick:, Yeah, I can't wait to ride it. ,[all the passengers on the bus run out and grab SpongeBob & Patrick while cheering],
,All:, Yes, we're here! Whoo! ,[SpongeBob & Patrick are carries into a brick wall],
,Employee:, Tickets, please. ,[SpongeBob looks in his pockets but no ticket],
,SpongeBob:, No tickets. I must have left it at home.
,Patrick:, I swallowed my tickets.

,Nat:, Hold on a second, there's your tickets in your back pockets. ,[grabs them both],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, barnacles!. ,[cut to later when SpongeBob and Patrick are walking around the amusement park], It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
,Patrick:, Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck.
,SpongeBob:, There it is. The line looks awfully long.
,Patrick:, Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler. ,[both run off],
,Patrick:, Phew.
,SpongeBob:, Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
,Patrick:, Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!
,SpongeBob:, I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove! ,[a giant glove costume is standing in front of them], Get over there and I'll take your picture with him. ,[Patrick moves a few steps into the camera so he's not too close to Glovey Glove], Get closer, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Nuh-uh.
,SpongeBob:, Come on, closer. ,[Patrick moves a little closer], That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile. ,[takes the picture],
,Patrick:, How do I look? ,[pictures shows Patrick touching Glovey Glove with only a finger], Wow, I look great. ,[a little kid is laughing on one of the kiddie rides],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, The Mitten!
,SpongeBob:, ,[clears throat], I mean, The Mitten.
,Patrick:, That ride's for babies.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is. ,[both walk over and get into the ride, with the little kid. When they go over a bump, they scream. When the ride is over, they get out and both are shivering; the baby snaps his fingers at SpongeBob and Patrick and walks away],
,Patrick:, I guess that ride was too much for the little guy. ,[cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in line by the Fiery Fist O' Pain],
,SpongeBob:, Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? ,[both chuckle nervously],
,Patrick:, Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters. ,[an old fish is wheel chaired out of Glove World!],
,Old Man Jenkins:, Oh, why, why, why? ,[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run off], Why won't you let me on the ride?
,Harold:, Sir, you have a serious medical condition.
,Old Man Jenkins:, But it's my birthday! ,[cut to SpongeBob and Patrick running through a line, cheering],
,Patrick:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, One more time!
,Tom:, You know, this is the line for the bathroom.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], We've gone eight times.
,Patrick:, And I went three times all by myself.
,Tom:, I'm going to walk away now. ,[does so],
,SpongeBob:, Bye.
,Patrick:, Have fun! ,[Larry walks up],
,Larry:, SpongeBob! Patrick!
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Larry.
,Larry:, I just got off the Fist O' Pain. Man, what a rush. ,[sniffs his armpit then sighs in relief as a green odor is released from under his arm], You smell that? That's the smell of adrenaline. ,[SpongeBob's and Patrick's eyebrows disintegrate],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it's, uh... ,[holding breath], very manly, Larry.
,Larry:, ,[picks up SpongeBob and smells him], SpongeBob, I'm not smelling any adrenaline on you. You haven't gone on the ride?
,SpongeBob:, Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry! ,[runs off],

,Patrick:, I'm hungry, too. ,[runs off],
,Larry:, Maybe I should stop making people smell me. ,[cut to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting at a table, eating ice cream, and looking at the explosions on the Fist O' Pain],
,Patrick:, Want some?
,SpongeBob:, No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.
,Patrick:, Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Hurry back so we can go on the ride. ,[sees the roller coaster drop and plants his face in the table],
,Ice Cream:, ,[SpongeBob talks to himself, SpongeBob voices the ice cream], What's the matter, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.
,Ice Cream:, Patrick's your best friend. You can't let him down.
,SpongeBob:, I know, but the ride is really scary.
,Ice Cream:, You wanna see scary? I'll show you scary! ,[hits himself in the head with the ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
,Ice Cream:, You like that? You like that? Huh, you like that? ,[cut to the bathroom where Patrick is talking to himself in the mirror],
,Patrick:, It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it.
,Reflection:, No you can't. You're a big crybaby.
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah? ,[punches his reflection, without breaking the glass], I thought we'd settled this the last time! ,[cut to SpongeBob still hitting himself in the head with the ice cream],
,SpongeBob:, Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
,Patrick:, ,[runs back], SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.
,SpongeBob:, I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
,Henry:, ,[over speaker], Attention. Glove World! will be closing in five minutes.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Five minutes?! ,[both run over to the ride. An employee comes over and cleans up the ice cream],
,Ice Cream:, What are you looking at? ,[cut to the ride],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reads the sign], Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, ...and explosive diarrhea. ,[explosion is heard],
,SpongeBob:, Is that all?
,Patrick:, Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning.
,Henry:, ,[over speaker], Last call for the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
,SpongeBob:, Well, this is it, Pat.
,Patrick:, Yep.
,Patrick:, Uh-huh.
,SpongeBob:, On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.

,SpongeBob & Patrick:, We're brave!
,Employee #3:, One... ,[when he presses the 'GO' button, SpongeBob and Patrick scream, but the roller coaster breaks down],
,Henry:, ,[over speaker], Uh, we're experiencing some technical difficulties.
,Employee #3:, Man, this cheap thing is always breaking down. Hey, sorry, guys. Maybe next time. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick sigh in relief],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
,Patrick:, Me too.
,SpongeBob:, I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
,Patrick:, I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
,SpongeBob:, But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
,Patrick:, Yeah! ,[employee comes back],
,Employee #3:, Oh, wait, it's fine.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Huh?
,Employee #3:, Have fun. ,[presses the 'GO' button again. SpongeBob and Patrick take off but their wrapping and helmets have come off],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them! ,[when they get to the top, it stops for a moment], Goodbye, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Goodbye, SpongeBob. ,[Coaster starts again, dropping and going through a saw, a flaming fist, and a laser. When the coaster drops at a 90 degree angle, SpongeBob and Patrick's skeletons fly through the air while their bodies go down with the coaster. Their skeletons fly into them as they go up, out of the water, but when they sit up, they have the other one's skeleton. The coaster drops into the ground, causing an explosion. When the ride is over, SpongeBob & Patrick are holding each other, shaking],
,Woman:, ,[over speaker], Please wait until the car has come to a complete stop. And stop crying!
,Employee #3:, It's over. You can get out now.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, We did it! ,[both get out and run around in circles],
,SpongeBob:, We conquered our fears!
,Patrick:, We stopped crying!
,SpongeBob:, We survived the Fist o' Pain!
,Employee #3:, Hey, hold it right there! You forgot these.
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Our spines! ,[grab their spines], Yeah! ,[when they grab them, they start to wiggle their bodies and then bend them backwards. They laugh],
,SpongeBob:, Let's go again!
,Patrick:, Yeah!

,SpongeBob:, Not at all. Read on.
,Patrick:, Doesn’t bother me.
,Sandy:, Get out of my suit!, [SpongeBob and Patrick are flushed out of Sandy’s suit], Well, golly! Randy says the rodeo’s come to town. I’ve got to head back to Texas and defend my championship title!
,SpongeBob:, Championship title? For what?
,Sandy:, You got cotton in your ears?
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick looks in SpongeBob’s ear], Hmm, no. It’s not cotton. It’s actually an old moldy piece of Krabby Patty. ,[Patrick eats the Krabby patty], Mmm.

,Patrick:, Eh, I’m indifferent.
,SpongeBob:, How could we live with ourselves if Sandy got hurt, and we weren’t there to help? Why, I wouldn’t be able to look at myself.
,Patrick:, Look at yourself? How do you do that? ,[Patrick spins around, trying to look at himself],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! This is no time for silly games! Sandy needs us. You understand? Patrick? Patrick!

,Gary:, Meow.
,Sandy:, Aw, cactus! That ol’ bullfrog’s got SpongeBob! Hang on, old buddy! ,[Sandy lassos SpongeBob away from the bullfrog, the crowd cheers], Next time, leave the rodeos to me.

SpongeBob gives him the paper but keeps the rubber band.], You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section! ,[shakes the rubber band around for emphasis. Hums while he stretches the rubber band around the middle of his body and snaps it together, turning him into a bowtie-like shape], I am a happy sponge! ,[runs around, laughing, while Gary is reading the paper],
,Gary:, ,[looking slightly annoyed by SpongeBob by rolling his eyes], Meow. ,[SpongeBob runs into Patrick, who also has a rubber band stretched around him],
,Patrick:, I see you got the paper. ,[his rubber band snaps off],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Patrick. ,[then his rubber band snaps off as well. Patrick clears his throat], Well, I'd better get going.
,Patrick:, Yep, see you later. ,[both walk off but then hear a chirping sound and they both quickly run back, with their hands over their ears],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, What did you say?
,Patrick:, Well, I didn't say anything.
,SpongeBob:, I didn't say anything, either.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, See you later then. ,[both walk off again and the squeaking noise is heard again, so they both run back. This time, they are angry],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Pointing at Patrick], Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.
,Patrick:, Ah, but it is you ,[points], that is messing with me. ,[both look down to see the squeaking noise is coming from a shaking branch. Patrick points downward.], That's what's messing with us.
,SpongeBob:, It's a baby scallop.
,Patrick:, ,[lifts up his foot with a threatening look on his face, looking as though he is about to smash the scallop], I'll take care of this!
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick! It's totally helpless. ,[takes the baby scallop in his hands], It looks like he can't even fly yet.
,Patrick:, What's the matter, is he stupid?
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, he's just a baby. ,[close-up of the chirping scallop in SpongeBob's hands], He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
,Patrick:, Well, we can't just leave him out here.
,SpongeBob:, You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple. ,[both run in and set the baby scallop on the ground], Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in. ,[SpongeBob removes his pants and sets it in front of the scallop], There you go. It's the best seat ,[points to his rear], in the house. ,[scene cuts to Gary, who does a rimshot],
,Patrick:, Let me see! ,[Patrick sticks his whole head inside SpongeBob's pants], Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh! ,[takes his head out, which is now eaten on the side], I think somebody's hungry!
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out Junior and speaks in baby-talk to it], Is it true? Are you hungry?
,Junior:, ,[chirping happily], Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
,SpongeBob:, I've got just the thing. ,[puts Junior on a barrel and takes out a Krabby Patty], How would you like a Krabby Patty? ,[Junior yelps],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
,SpongeBob:, Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. ,[shows Junior a minuscule Krabby Patty],
,Junior:, ,[sniffs the patty, then sticks his tongue out in disgust], Blech!
,SpongeBob:, Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. ,[gobbles it and gulps it down],
,Patrick:, ,[holds up a donut], Let's try a donut. ,[Junior hisses],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up a tray of French fries], French fries?
,Junior:, ,[shaking his head], Unh-unh.
,Patrick:, ,[eating the donut], A donut? ,[Junior blows a raspberry],

,Worm:, Hello, sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World! ,[Junior chirps in excitement],
,SpongeBob:, Of course, scallops love worms. ,[picks up the worm],
,Worm:, Huh, wait! We will bury you! ,[SpongeBob drops it in Junior's mouth],
,SpongeBob:, Well, you should be good for the rest of the... ,[Junior cries],
,Patrick:, What now?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know! Aww, don't cry. ,[Junior is still crying],

,SpongeBob:, Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo! Look at the funny face! ,[shows SpongeBob has a puppet that looks like him on his hand], Look at the funny face!
,Patrick:, Wait. I think I might know the problem. ,[picks up Junior and looks at him], Yep, that's it, alright. ,[hides it behind his back], Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. ,[Junior has a diaper on],
,SpongeBob:, How did you know?
,Patrick:, How do you think? ,[drops his pants showing that he is wearing a diaper], And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
,Patrick:, I know, good thing there's two of us.
,SpongeBob:, You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
,Patrick:, Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom.
,SpongeBob:, I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
,Patrick:, You're right. If I was a mom..., ,[the camera draws back to reveal Patrick's hairy, obese, unsightly form],...this would be kind of shocking. ,[lifts his arms, revealing armpit hair], Just call me Daddy!
,Montage:
,Patrick:, ,[softly, from inside the house], It sure is cute when it's asleep.
,SpongeBob:, ,[softly, from inside the house], Yeah. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick watch Junior sleeping], Shh! ,[both tiptoe out of the room],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob? ,[goes to what appears to be the right side of the bed],
,SpongeBob:, ,[goes to what appears to be the left side], Yes, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
,SpongeBob:, Me neither.

,SpongeBob:, Good night, Patrick. ,[SpongeBob's mattress slams shut on top of Patrick. Scene cuts to morning], Patrick, breakfast is ready. ,[SpongeBob is cooking something over at the grill as Patrick walks in, noticing the bunch of food that is on the table],
,Patrick:, Alright. All this parenting stuff makes me hungry. ,[lifts the table up as all the food slides down into mouth. He burps, then pats Junior], Hey, Junior, how are you doing today? ,[smells an odor from Junior], SpongeBob? ,[adjusts his tie],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Kid's got a stinky.
,SpongeBob:, ,[doing many chores at the same time], Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. ,[Patrick guzzles down the coffee as Junior begins to cry],
,Patrick:, ,[drinking coffee], Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.

,Patrick:, ,[puts on a suit and takes his briefcase], I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
,SpongeBob:, You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
,Patrick:, I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. ,[chuckles as he closes the door],
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[chuckles weakly. Day turns into night, and Patrick walks in and takes his jacket and hat off],
,Patrick:, Phew, what a day.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby.
,Patrick:, Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work.

,Patrick:, Hey, I'm missin' the coconut! ,[he gives SpongeBob an angry look],
,SpongeBob:, You haven't been helping at all with Junior! ,[pulls in baby stroller], We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
,Patrick:, I changed his diaper!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, once.
,Patrick:, He's only this big. ,[shows with his hands on how big Junior is], How many diapers could he possibly use?
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens up a trash can full of diapers], Hmmm?
,Patrick:, Oh, that's not so much.
,SpongeBob:, ,[points over to the corner of the room where there are two bags and a trash can full of diapers], Hmmm?
,Patrick:, ,[nervously], So?
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens up the refrigerator, full of diapers], Hmmm? ,[pulls the cover off the couch, revealing it to be diapers], Hmmm? ,[tears the wallpaper off the wall, revealing a bunch of diapers behind it], Hmmm!? ,[points outside to a garbage truck loading a bunch of diapers into the dumpster. Patrick quivers at the sight of it],
,Patrick:, ,[his eyes fill with tears], I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh! ,[sobs as he looks at SpongeBob as he smiles], I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise. ,[scene cuts to next day],
,SpongeBob:, So, what's the plan for the day?
,Patrick:, No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gives Patrick his briefcase as he departs], Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.

,SpongeBob:, Oh, nothing.
,Patrick:, Oh, what a relief. ,[takes the lampshade off his head and puts it on SpongeBob], For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes the lampshade off his head], Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
,Patrick:, Somethin' about root beer, right?
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes a deep breath, flatly], No.
,Patrick:, Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.

,SpongeBob:, ,[angrily], So, ,this, is work?
,Patrick:, You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote, ,[looks at his rear], and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!

,Patrick:, ,[quietly but furiously], Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?

,Patrick:, Yeah, overtime, pal!

,Patrick:, ,[still mad], There's that stupid noise again!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
,[Patrick and SpongeBob see Junior teetering on the edge of the window of SpongeBob's house, ready to fly.],
,Patrick:, ,[calmly], Oh.
,[All at once, Patrick and SpongeBob are struck with shock by what's really happening.],
,Both:, ,[eyes bulge in horror, screaming], ,JUNIOR!,
,[Junior jumps down the window. SpongeBob and Patrick quickly run to catch Junior but they slam on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob then bounces out of Patrick's stomach],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Frantic],Did you catch him?!
,Patrick:, ,[looking sadly at his empty hands], No.
,Both:, We're bad parents! ,[They break down sobbing. Then they stop when they notice that chirping Junior is flying above them.],
,SpongeBob:, Junior? Hey, he's flying.
,Patrick:, I guess he's all grown up. ,[Junior kisses SpongeBob then flies off], Hey, what about Daddy? ,[Junior drops a coconut on Patrick's head for his laziness then kisses him], That's my boy.
,SpongeBob:, Goodbye.
,Patrick:, ,[the coconut falls down], Goodbye, Junior.
,[they watch Junior fly away],
,SpongeBob:, Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
,Patrick:, This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
,SpongeBob:, Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.

"[the episode opens with Squidward lying in bed, asleep and he wakes up to a loud noise],
,Squidward:, What the...? ,[we see SpongeBob outside grinding his spatula on a rotating wheel and Squidward opens window], SpongeBob, do you mind!?
,[Squidward breaks the window off its hinges and throws it at SpongeBob. The window hits the rotating wheel instead and it bounces off and hits Squidward in the face. From the impact, he loses his balance and falls out the window, he then bounces on his head and then bounces off of SpongeBob's pineapple, his tentacles land over SpongeBob's eyes, causing SpongeBob to finally notice Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Hey, Squidward. What are you doing?
,Squidward:, ,[gets back up], What am I doing!? What are ,you, doing!?
,SpongeBob:, I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?
,Squidward:, Cala-what?
,[SpongeBob then proceeds in a series of rather ridiculous stretches as Squidward walks back to his house to lock the door, Squidward then starts walking to work],
,SpongeBob:, Walking to work, huh, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Go away.
,SpongeBob:, Can I walk with you?
,Squidward:, No.
,SpongeBob:, Please?
,Squidward:, No. ,[the last two lines are repeated several times as they both walk, Squidward finally gets fed up with SpongeBob's repetitious begging as they enter the Krusty Krab], I said ,NO!, I will not walk to work with yo--! ,[notices he is in the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!
,[fade out, the next scene shows Squidward at the register with a customer],
,Customer:, I'll have two Krabby Patties.
,Squidward:, Okay. And would you like cheese on-- ,[he stops at a noise that sounds like someone extruding gas],
,Customer:, Do you...need a break or something?
,Squidward:, ,[nervously], What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear. ,[sound repeats, the customer walks away with Squidward stuttering and begging nervously, Squidward walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is unsuccessfully attempting to squeeze mustard onto a Krabby Patty], SpongeBob! ,[he snatches the mustard bottle from SpongeBob and opens the mustard bottle], It's empty! ,[he then shoves the mustard bottle into SpongeBob's eye], See empty!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Squidward, how do you know that? ,[Squidward takes the mustard bottle out of SpongeBob's eye],
,Squidward:, Well, let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain. ,[as he said this, he leans on the grill],
,SpongeBob:, Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on.
,Squidward:, Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is... ,[he sees his hand burning on the grill and then screams, he runs around SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, I gotta do something. ,[he removes the mop and then takes the bucket of water, Squidward runs to the right], Okay, Squidward, this should help. ,[SpongeBob turns the bucket sideways and is ready pour it on Squidward but accidentally spills the water, Squidward slips on the puddle of water and is flying in mid-air], Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you. ,[he got out his jellyfishing net and holds it up to catch Squidward, but Squidward goes in the net and hit's the wall snapping the net in the process, Squidward then falls in a deep fryer and is being fried, SpongeBob screams and goes over to deep fryer and picks up the net with Squidward in it, now Squidward looks like an ice cream cone when he's fried and we see a close up of the fried Squidward], I can fix this. ,[he runs but he accidentally trips on the mop that was on the floor, he hit's a tin cupboard and bounces off and slams into the counter, Squidward is sent flying and into a customer's Krabby Patty taking it's place, the customer takes a bite out of Squidward causing him and the customer to scream, Squidward jumps away and flies into the other direction, SpongeBob runs to intercept him], This time, I got ya. ,[Squidward hits SpongeBob's face and bounces off and finally crashing into a soda dispenser, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs gasps, Squidward lies there muttering as the soda sprays on him, Mr. Krabs rushes near the mess],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me soda machine! ,[cries],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I... ,[Squidward smacks SpongeBob away and screams, then leaps behind table, destroying it], Squidward? ,[Squidward screams and whacks two customers away, he climbs up wall and looks down at floor],
,Mr. Krabs:, You really sent him over the edge this time.
,SpongeBob:, Technically, I drove him up the wall.
,Narrator:, One shift later...
,Squidward:, Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gives a big smile with twinkling eyes], Present? A present? For me?
,Squidward:, Now, now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!
,[Squidward knocks SpongeBob down and gives him the piece of paper],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Squidward! My very own...,[Looks at the restraining order], restraining order. Uh...what is that?
,Squidward:, Perhaps my lawyers should explain. ,[points over to his lawyers Harry, Combover, and Bald],
,Harry:, We are the law offices of Harry, Combover, and Bald! Specializing in restraining order logical law and here to tell one Mr. SquarePants...
,Harry, Combover, & Bald:, You've been served!
,SpongeBob:, Served? I don't understand. Squidward, what is these guys- ,[Before he can reach Squidward, he is stopped by Harry and Combover and Bald pushes Squidward further from him],
,Bald:, Per paragraph 3 of the restraining order, you may no longer speak to our client. ,[Draws a dot circle on the ground with chalk], Likewise, you may not come within 15 feet of Mr. Squidward at any time. Any infractions of these statues will result in serious jail time!
,SpongeBob:, Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during ""serious jail time""?
,Bald:, Huh? ,[Squidward whispers in his ear],
,Squidward:, And. ,[Back to whispering],
,Bald:, No.
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], No! I don't wanna go!
,Combover:, Well, then, follow the guidelines we've explain and you won't have to.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to, or get within fifteen feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?
,Harry, Combover, and Bald:, That's not our problem. ,[They all fly off],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Walks in front of the dotted line], Hmm...,[Next scene to him cooking Krabby Patties and puts them on a long hand-made spatula made of wood and mops], There we go! Three Krabby Patties, two large Kelpy Colas, and three fries ready to be served. ,[Tries to give Squidward the order but he puts up a glass window], Hmm? ,[Carries the order on the hand-made spatula with stings and another piece of wood on the other side of Squidward also in front of the door. Mr. Krabs comes out, walks right into it and it knocks him on the ground], Oops! ,[Run over to Mr. Krabs], Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order. ,[Shows him the restraining order],
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me see that! ,[Takes the restraining order and wipes the mustard off him, then gives it back to SpongeBob], Thank you! Look, boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart! ,[Takes away a star from SpongeBob's Employee Chart],
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams], Think, SpongeBob, think! Gasp! I got it!
,[Cuts to Patrick in the Krusty Krab],
,Patrick:, ,[Giggling and moves closer and closer to Squidward], Hehe.
,Squidward:, ,[Reading a book], Oh, if I ignore it, maybe it will go away.
,Patrick:, ,[Still giggling], Hehe.
,Squidward:, I thought not ,[Closes the book], Oh-kay Patrick. What? What? What!
,Patrick:, ,[Still giggling], Notice anything... ,[Smacks Squidward's noise with the Krusty Krab hat he is wearing], Different? Huh? Huh? A hint! ,[Takes out a drawing held upside-down of the Krusty Krab hat pointing to it and his hat],
,Mr. Krabs:, Patrick! I am not not paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!
,Squidward:, Yeah, Patrick! Get back to...what? Work? Oh no! No! No! No! Krabs! ,[Walks past SpongeBob who moves backwards then forwards], Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Why all the shivering of the timbers, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!
,Mr. Krabs:, It'll stand. Oh, unless you'd rather talk with SpongeBob.
,[Squidward grunts angrily then bubble transition to a customer buying a Krabby Patty. Squidward hands Patrick the ticket and Patrick takes it to SpongeBob who then makes the Krabby Patties then hands it to Patrick. Patrick gives the order to Squidward who then gives it to the customer],
,Squidward:, What?
,Patrick:, Can I watch you work?
,Squidward:, No.
,Patrick:, Please? ,[This line is repeated several more times, as Squidward gets fed up with Patrick asking].,
,Squidward:, No!
,Patrick:, Pretty please?
,Squidward:, No! No! No! No! ,[growls], ,[Patrick continues to follow him], Go away Patrick! Go away Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! ,[Washes hands and Patrick appears in the mirror], Patrick! ,[Patrick touches his hat],  Patrick! ,[Pushes button on cash register and Patrick appears], Patrick! ,[Starts walking with Patrick closely following him behind], Patrick! ,[Using the restroom with Patrick beside him], Patrick! ,[Starts sweating and shivering with Mr. Krabs now beside him],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward...
,Squidward:, ,[screams],
,Mr. Krabs:, Time for your break. ,[Walks off],
,Squidward:, Ah...don't mind if I do. ,[Sits down], Ah...no better way to spend a break then with a little cool jazz. ,[Takes out the box that holds his clarinet and tries to play it but it isn't there], Huh?
,Patrick:, ,[Comes out of the restroom], Hi Squidward!
,Squidward:, Hello...you...
,Patrick:, I just finished cleaning the restroom!
,Squidward:, ,[Sarcastically], Ooh...that's great...
,Patrick:, I mopped the floors! I shined the mirrors! I scrubbed the sinks.
,Squidward:, ,[Sarcastically], Wonderful.
,Patrick:, Oh yeah! ,[Takes out Squidward's clarinet that is soaking wet], But we are going to need a new toilet plunger. This one's broken.
,Squidward:, Patrick! ,[Takes back the clarinet and growls at Patrick which Mr. Krabs appears to see what is happening],
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice work, Patrick! Break time's over, Mr. Squidward.
,Squidward:,  ,[Walks over to a customer], Welcome to the House of Misery. May I take your order...
,Dave:, Yes, I would like two Double Fried Kelp Fritters, three Krusty Krab Cream Filled Corals, and four Triple Fatty Krabby Patties. Is that too much?
,Squidward:, That depends...
,Dave:, On what?
,Squidward:, How long you want to live? ,[Laughs and walks right into Patrick],
,Patrick:, ,[Laughs as Squidward's noise is stuck in is mouth. Squidward tries hard to get his nose free and he does but goes flying in the process], Hah hah! Squidward's funny! ,[Looks down and picks up something], Hey, a button!
,Gus:, ,[Comes in holding a pie], Oh, Grammy, I brought your favorite; seaberry pie. ,[Notices Squidward flying toward him], Yikes! ,[Runs away],
,Squidward:, ,[Crashes into the seaberry pie and then onto the window. Then tastes the pie], Seaberries? I'm allergic to...,[Body and face puff up], Seaberries...That's it! I know what I must do! ,[Starts walking toward SpongeBob], SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, You're the prettiest button I've ev... ,[Spots Squidward], Huh? Monster!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, It's after SpongeBob! ,[Pause and looks at the button], You're right, button! No monster is going to eat our friend! ,[Jumps up high and yells; heads toward Squidward],  
,Squidward:, No, no no no wait!
,[Patrick lands on Squidward and starts attacking him. They both head into the back where SpongeBob is then they start fighting],
,SpongeBob:, Oh no! My two best friends are fighting! ,[Takes out restraining order], But this restraining order says I can't get close enough to break it off! ,[Watches as Squidward squirts mustard at Patrick's face and Patrick then hits him with a spatula. They both continue to roll around and fight], I'm sorry, restraining order! But my friends need me! ,[Screams and dives toward Squidward and Patrick and breaks up the fighting], Stop!
,Squidward:, ,[Notices the restraining order in SpongeBob's pocket and takes it], Give me that restraining order!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams],
,Squidward:, Alright, right, let's look at this.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, please don't send me to jail!
,Patrick:, ,[Confused], Squidward? ,[Looks at his button], Did you know the monster was Squidward? Well, when were you going to tell me?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Starts crying], I violated the restraining order! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
,Squidward:, Quit bellyaching and hand me a pen.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Cries], Here you go. ,[Hands him a pen then continues crying],
,Squidward:, Stop the waterworks! You're not going to jail.
,SpongeBob:, I'm not? ,[stops crying],
,Squidward:, No! I'm releasing you from this order. ,[Crosses out SpongeBob's name on the restraining order],
,SpongeBob:, Really, Squidward?
,Squidward:, ...And adding someone who is much more deserving!
,Patrick:, Sorry, button.

"[Transitions to an outside view of the Bikini Bottom Recital Hall. Inside, on the stage is Squilliam Fancyson. Flowers are being thrown to him],
,Squilliam:, Thank you. ,[he bows], Thank you. ,[he catches a flower and sniffs it], Ah.
,[Squidward, in a sweater the same color as his usual shirt, watches, irritated, in the audience. A fish next to him leans over him],
,Music Lover:, Isn't it grand?
,Squidward:, What is?
,Music Lover:, He's such a great musician. He doesn't even have to touch an instrument to be brilliant! ,[The clarinet plays on a table besides Squilliam. He moves his arms towards it and the cheering of the crowd gets louder],
,Squidward:, Alright, I've had enough! ,[He stands up and walks out], Bunch of nonsense!
,Music School Headmaster:, Why, here he comes now.
,Music School Headmistress:, ,[gasps], It ,is, him!
,Squidward:, Huh?
,Music School Headmistress:, Aren't you the esteemed Squilliam Fancyson the Third, who we all came here to see perform tonight?
,Squidward:, No, I am not, nor would I ever want to be! I am quite content being Squidward Q. Tentacles.
,Music School Headmistress:, Oh, dear. Well, that's too bad.
,Squidward:, Why?
,Music School Headmistress:, Because I'm head matron at an esteemed musical college in town and thought if you ,were, Squilliam Fancyson, I would offer you the high-paying and prestigious opportunity to come there and teach your very own music class.
,Squidward:, My very own music class? Did you say ""Squilliam Fancyson""?
,Music School Headmistress:, Yes.
,Squidward:, I'm... Squilliam Fancyson.
,Music School Headmistress:, But didn't you just say a minute ago that your name was Squidward Q. Tentacles?
,Squidward:, It is... No, I mean, uh, no, no, I didn't!
,Music School Headmistress:, Well, that's a relief. I mean, what kind of a moron would go to their worst enemy's music recital?
,Music School Headmaster:, A very pathetic one, that's whom. ,[both laugh],
,Squidward:, ,[pretends to laugh], Oh.
,Music School Headmistress:, Well, good evening, Professor Squilliam.
,Squidward:, Who? Ha, um, uh, and a good evening to you as well. ,[runs off],
,Music School Headmaster:, Hmm, music types.
,Music School Headmistress:, Ooh, they're so strange.
,[Transitions to Squidward's music teaching lesson building. Inside, Squidward, wearing a large white curly wig, enters the classroom],
,Squidward:, ,[clears throat], Good evening, students. Now, our first...
,Students:, Good evening, Professor.
,Squidward:, As I was saying, our first...
,[Billy puts his hand up],
,Squidward:, Yes?
,Billy:, Aren't you gonna write your name on the board like most professors do?
,Squidward:, My-my name? What for?
,Billy:, Well, you know, it just seems like teachers usually write their names on the board the first day of class.
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], Why don't ,you, come write ,your, name on the board? We'll see how ,you, like it.
,Billy:, Okay.
,[Billy walks up to the board and writes his name],
,Squidward:, There, now how does ,that, feel, Billy?
,Billy:, Okay, I-I guess.
,Squidward:, Good. Now, why don't you take your seat and stop poking your nose into other people's business?! ,[Billy walks back to his seat], Now, if we can go for five minutes without having any further interruptions. I would like to...
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughing and pointing at Squidward], Hey, look! It's Squid... ,[Squidward quickly puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth, cutting off the rest of his speech],
,Squidward:, Squilliam, everybody, he was about to say ""Squilliam""!
,Patrick:, Oh, uh, oh, actually, I think he was about to say Squid... ,[Squidward puts his other hand over Patrick's mouth and Patrick mumbles],
,Squidward:, ,[nervously], Didn't you two nincompoops know? I have my name legally changed to Squilliam Fancyson. And you are to refer to me only as Professor Squilliam from now until the end of time. Now blink twice so I know you understand. ,[Patrick and SpongeBob blink twice], Okay, good. ,[Patrick blinks one more time], Hey, he blinked three times!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, only eight minutes in and we've already been given a math quiz. Very advanced music class, huh, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I'll say.
,Squidward:, Would you two numb skulls mind telling me what you're doing in music class anyway?
,SpongeBob:, Sure! Patrick's New Year's resolution was to learn to play an instrument!
,Squidward:, You told me your resolution was to sign up for an all natural slimming, toning, and increased muscle mass program!
,Patrick:, It was. I traded with SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, And I have been very happy with the results. See? ,[shows his muscular leg to Squidward],
,Squidward:, Wow, those ,are, impressive results.
,[Transitions to later in the classroom],
,Squidward:, ,[clears throat], As you may not be aware, music is a... ,[SpongeBob giggles], Music is a... ,[SpongeBob giggles], Music is a complicated series of... ,[SpongeBob giggles. Squidward glares at the class], ...is a complicated series of notes that when played in the... ,[SpongeBob giggles. Squidward stomps up to him], SpongeBob, do you mind?! There are other people here besides you, you know. And I don't think they appreciate you depriving them of my wisdom!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], I'm sorry, Professor Squilliam. ,[SpongeBob winks at Squidward], Patrick here keeps tickling my foot.
,Patrick:, No way! He's making that up! It was him!
,Squidward:, You expect me to believe he was tickling himself?
,Patrick:, You better tell him, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Alright, it was me.
,Squidward:, You were tickling yourself?
,SpongeBob:, Mm hmm!
,Squidward:, How?
,SpongeBob:, Like this. ,[close up of him rubbing his shoes together. SpongeBob bursts out laughing and continuously rubs his feet together],
,Squidward:, Alright, that's enough!
,[Transitions to show the students now in a straight line, with SpongeBob and Patrick at both ends],
,Squidward:, There. Now, as I was saying, music is a series of complex... ,[SpongeBob laughs], SpongeBob, I told you to stop tickling yourself!
,Patrick:, Actually, that time, it really was me.
,[Squidward looks baffled, transitions to later],
,Squidward:, Now, I'm going to put some notes on the chalkboard. ,[Squidward goes to the board and draws a staff. Patrick starts whispering to SpongeBob], Excuse me? Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?
,Patrick:, Uh-uh.
,Squidward:, Go on, you've already interrupted once. You might as well tell us what was so very important.
,Patrick:, Well, I was just saying that these lines you drew remind me of a railroad track.
,Squidward:, I have never heard anything more insipid, insane, uninteresting, or irrelevant!
,Patrick:, Well, actually, there ,was, a railroad convention in town last week, and I bought myself this nifty conductor's cap. ,[he takes out the hat and puts it on],
,Squidward:, I have never seen a more ridiculous looking outfit on top of anybody's head, anywhere!
,Patrick:, Well, I don't know. Suits my needs.
,Squidward:, What else did you buy at this convention? Your very own locomotive? ,[starts laughing. Patrick pulls up a toy train],
,Patrick:, Yes.
,Squidward:, Ha! Ha! Ha! What the...?
,[Patrick, now shrunk down to the train's size, climbs into the train, toots the horn and drives the train on a track going past SpongeBob and the other students. It then goes into what appears to be a tunnel which is then shown to be a garbage can being held by Squidward. Squidward then takes the can outside and dumps it with the other cans, then he goes back inside],
,Squidward:, Now, where were... ,[sees Patrick back in his seat], ...we?
,[Transitions to later],
,Squidward:, This is what's known as a metronome.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, my mom has one of those in her garden!
,Patrick:, No, SpongeBob, that was a garden gnome.
,Squidward:, ,[clears throat], Anyway, the metronome helps us keep time.
,[He starts the metronome and it starts ticking. SpongeBob and Patrick suddenly start staring at the metronome as though they are in a trance. They start swaying to the rhythm],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...
,Squidward:, Do you mind? ,[they don't respond], Is there something seriously wrong with your HEADS?!
,SpongeBob:, My whole life has been pointed in one direction.
,Patrick:, I see that now. There's never been any choice for me.
,Squidward:, Will you two nincompoops cut it out?! Or am I gonna...
,[Knocking on the door. A news reporter and a cameraman enter the classroom],
,Bikini Bottom News Reporter:, Hello! We're with the local Bikini Bottom News Channel. I'm a reporter. ,[Squidward gasps and neatens his wig], We're here to conduct an interview with the esteemed musical genius Squilliam Fancyson.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are still ticking],
,Squidward:, Please ignore them.
,Bikini Bottom News Reporter:, Are those students of yours?
,Squidward:, Nope, they're just morons. Come on, you two, snap out of it!
,Bikini Bottom News Reporter:, They appear to be in some type of trance. A case of genuine hypnosis like this make a much hotter scoop.
,Squidward:, Hotter? Scoop?!
,Bikini Bottom News Reporter:, Well, it's the sort of thing that borders the paranormal. Our viewers just eat that stuff up.
,Squidward:, Paranormal?! The only thing paranormal around here is how fast I'm going to make you two disappear!! ,[he starts pushing the reporter and cameraman out of the room],
,Bikini Bottom News Reporter:, Don't blame me, blame the market. ,[Squidward slams door. A bell rings and SpongeBob and Patrick jolt as though they have woken up],
,SpongeBob:, Wha...? Where am I? I felt like I was in some sort of horrible trance. ,[Squidward's eyes narrow angrily],
,Squidward:, You wanna know what happened?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Okay!
,Squidward:, You once again managed to single-handedly annihilate what might be the one and only chance I may ever get to sew just one tiny seed of creative hope into the culturally barren wasteland that each and every one of us is forced to call home!
,Harold:, Actually, I've been commuting from upstate.
,Squidward:, Now, I don't suppose you two have anything to say for yourselves?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess if I was to say one thing, it would have to be: We're sorry, Squidward. ,[Squidward looks horrified],
,Patrick:, Yeah, we're sorry, Squidward.
,Squidward:, ,[frantic], No, no, no, no, no! Shh shh shh...
,Harold:, Hey, did those guys just call you Squidward?
,Squidward:, ,[frantic], No, no, no, no, no! They said ""Squilliam""!
,Gus:, Oh! I knew this guy was phony from minute one! I'm gettin' outta here.
,Harold:, Yeah, me, too! I'm gonna get my tuition back!
,Squidward:, No! Wait! ,[Everyone walks to the door and Squidward blocks it], NO! You're not going anywhere!
,[The door is smashed open and several police fish run in. Squidward, who was flattened against the wall by the door, is grabbed by them],
,Squidward:, Wha-What's going on here?
,Johnson:, Sorry, Professor, your little symphony is over.
,[Music School Headmistress and the real Squilliam Fancyson are there],
,Music School Headmistress:, It's true, we're onto your little ruse! ,[The reporter and cameraman are there too],
,Bikini Bottom News Reporter:, What a hot scoop!
,Music School Headmistress:, The ,real, Squilliam, as we all know, has a large, bushy unibrow just at the base of his forehead! ,[She points to Squilliam's unibrow],
,Squidward:, But...
,[A police fish takes Squidward's wig off],
,Green Police Fish:, No unibrow. Squidward Q. Tentacles, I'm placing you under arrest for impersonating a genius.
,[Squidward is handcuffed and taken away by the police. SpongeBob takes out the metronome, starts it, and he and Patrick start swaying to the rhythm again],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...

"Mrs. Puff:, Okay, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. ,[class groans],
,SpongeBob:, ,[leans towards Nat], Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
,Mrs. Puff:, Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. ,[class groans again],
,SpongeBob:, ,[again leaning towards Nat], Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
,Mrs. Puff:, In no less than 800 words! ,[squeals and class groans again],
,Nat:, ,[acting like SpongeBob], Did you hear that? 800 words!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I know! ,[Nat frowns],
,Mrs. Puff:, Due tomorrow. And remember, class: work hard and no goofing off.
,[back at SpongeBob's house],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is ,[holds up a pencil], the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. ,[kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it], Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. ,[looks at window, it's colorful outside], Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey, this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now, pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! ,[SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words], Gee, this is harder than I thought... ,[looks outside. There is a carnival. Squidward is suntanning. A boy is eating ice cream. Jellyfish are playing tennis. Gary is riding on a ball and playing a horn. Patrick is rubbing Sandy with sunscreen],
,Patrick:, Come on, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob sinks back down out of sight of the window],
,SpongeBob:, It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! ,[a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up. Cut back to SpongeBob], Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6:00! ,[cuts to SpongeBob's ticking clock, then back to SpongeBob at his desk], Okay, here we go, here we go. ,[SpongeBob struggles to write], Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? ,[does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites Hup Ho several times. His nose and eyelashes do the same thing.], I can feel those juices pumpin' now! ,[moves his chair closer to the table. He does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs], Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! ,[pushes his chair in], Come on, pencil, make words.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?

,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary! ,[Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food, he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level], I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. ,[Gary quickly eats it], Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? ,[steps in Garys food], Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. ,[cleans it up using himself as a mop], Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places, too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. ,[cut to SpongeBob, who has already finished], Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10:00! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written! ,[Begins active writing], I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah...yeah...yeah! And some of these, and some of these...Almost there and...done. Now let’s see how it looks so far. ""The-"" ,[shows he has only written ""the"" in fancy lettering], Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go...think, SpongeBob, think! ,[looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up],
,Patrick:, Who is that? ,[picks up the phone], Hello?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?
,Patrick:, Sleeping.
,SpongeBob:, That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss, I remember on the...
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps and stammers], That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
,Patrick:, Well, I'm listening.
,SpongeBob:, Uh...Marco!
,Patrick:, Polo. ,[hangs up],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, well I gotta get going, Patrick, got an important essay to write? ,[hangs up the phone], Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? ,[back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper], I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space. ,[blows them away], So long, Pesky Particles! ,[they float back to SpongeBob, who chokes on one], I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! ,[goes to the kitchen and drinks water], That was a close one.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean 'overly dramatic?', Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese ,[doorbell rings], A visitor? For me!? ,[SpongeBob opens the door to meet a mailfish], Hello!
,Mailfish:, Package for Mr. SquarePants.
,SpongeBob:, Great, thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?
,Mailfish:, It puts bread on the table.
,SpongeBob:, Rye or pumpernickel? ,[laughs],
,Maifish:, Oh, brother..
,SpongeBob:, So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well, I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...
,Mailfish:, Don't you have a paper to write? ,[He walks away],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gulps and zooms in on his face], How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? ,[blips his eyes and slides back into his house],
,Johnny Elaine:, In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. ,[head sticks out TV], When will he learn?
,SpongeBob:, Hi-yah! ,[karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. SpongeBob lights a candle],
,Chair:, Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up], Oh no! Midnight! ,[running in the hallway and the alarms ring on the walls], Must.. get... back to desk! ,[runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair], Whew, that was a close call. ,[his pants are missing], Ah! My pants!
,Pants:, Yoo hoo! Down here!
,SpongeBob:, You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
,Pants:, ,[runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door], Freedom!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs out the door], Stop, Pants! You get back here this instant! Paaants...! ,[door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. He looks in the window. The candle is still lighting. The clock spins, breaks, and comes to life],
,Clock:, ,[ghostly voice], Time's up, SpongeBob...
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps the candle melts], Burning!
,Flame:, Only 799 words to go! ,[laughs sinisterly and he burns essay and the inside of his pineapple burns],
,SpongeBob:, No! ,[as his house burns, he screams], What have I done?! ,[SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling], Help! Help! My house is on fire! ,[continues running around his burnt house until it comes to life],
,House:, SpongeBob, why?! Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob?! Why didn't you just write your essay?! ,[breathes loudly], Stop wasting time!
,SpongeBob:, ,[wakes up. It was only a nightmare], Huh!? Where's my essay? Oh, there you are! ,[laughs], I must have dozed off. ,[grabs his paper from his head], Let’s see, where are we? ,[holding his paper with a word ""The"" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk], Do I dare look at the clock..? ,[gasps], It's almost 9:00! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes?! How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight... ,[writing], And... making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... ,[cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school], Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! ,[goes inside, but nobody is there], Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, there you are, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em.
,Mrs. Puff:, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you.. I have to go to a teacher's convention!
,SpongeBob:, But what about my essay?
,Mrs. Puff:, I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
,[SpongeBob rips his essay. He then rips himself],
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. ,[class groans],
,SpongeBob:, ,[leans towards Nat], Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
,Mrs. Puff:, Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. ,[class groans again],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Again leaning towards Nat], Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
,Mrs. Puff:, In no less than 800 words. ,[squeals and class groans again],
,Nat:, ,[acting like SpongeBob], Did you hear that? 800 words!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I know! ,[Nat frowns],
,Mrs. Puff:, Due tomorrow. And remember class: work hard and no goofing off.
,[back at SpongeBob's house],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is ,[holds up a pencil], the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. ,[kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it], Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. ,[looks at window, it's colorful outside], OK, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! ,[SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words], Gee, this is harder than I thought...
,SpongeBob:,  I can feel those juices pumpin' now! ,[moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs], Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! ,[pushes his chair in], Come on, pencil, make words.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How’s my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean you're not hungry?

,Mr. Krabs:, When he goes, you can go. ,[Mr. Krabs walks off as Squidward bashes his head on the register in disgust.],
,Squidward:, Grr! ,[Squidward walks up to Dennis who is sucking on his French fry], Excuse me, sir. But you seem to be having trouble masticating. Here let me help you. ,[Squidward shoves the French fry in Dennis' mouth and makes him chew it until he swallows it. Dennis gets up and leaves.], What? No tip? Finally! Yes! ,[walks out the door], Leaving early! I can't believe this is finally happening! ,[Suddenly, the sky turns black and rain starts to pour. The wind blows the flags off the Krusty Krab. A bolt of lightning strikes the Krusty Krab sign and the shell breaks off. The wind blows a bulldozer and breaks the sign pole off the ground. Then lightning strikes Squidward, leaving him barbecued. Squidward runs back into the restaurant.], Cause it's not.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days.
,SpongeBob:, Old navy days?! Ohh!
,Mr. Krabs:, That gives me a fine idea, SpongeBob. Since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies? While I retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past. ,[Squidward, who is barbecued from the storm, turns to dust. Then it cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward sitting at a table as Mr. Krabs brings a bowl.], There, now. The lights are properly dimmed. ,[pulls out an open, cracker box], Feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies ,[dumps the cube of stale crackers from the box and on the table. The cube shatters the bowl], as I explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest.
,Squidward:, I don't want any hair on my chest.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, I do! ,[SpongeBob takes the cube of stale crackers, shoves it in his mouth and eats it.],
,Mr. Krabs:, It was a day just like this one. The wind was howling! ,[As Mr. Krabs begins his story, the scene changes to a ship sailing through a storm at sea.], And me ship was being tossed about,  like a rag doll on a trampoline! ,[The scene changes to the moment where Mr. Krabs, who had hair at that time, was a chef.], I was in the galley! Cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall! ,[Mr. Krabs chops some vegetables and made a salad. Then he peels a potato and adds it to the soup on the stove. He then takes a petal from a flower and adds it to the soup. Then he added some spices which formed in the shape of a heart and flies in the soup.], It was just then that he bursts into the galley!
,SpongeBob:, Who he?
,Mr. Krabs:, The man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare! ,[As Mr. Krabs explains, SpongeBob takes the cracker box and eats some more stale crackers. He then eats the box next.], The roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep! He was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman! ,[changes back to the ship], They called him, ,[A starfish that resembles Patrick Star bursts through the galley door in a captain outfit with a scar on the right side of his face], Captain Scarfish!
,Captain Scarfish:, Hello!
,SpongeBob:, Ahh! ,[cuts back to Mr. Krabs putting frosting on the cake. Scarfish's entrance scares him and accidentally melts the cake with the frosting.],
,Captain Scarfish:, Stand at attention, Mr. Krabs! ,[Mr. Krabs walks up and salutes the captain in fear.], I want you to tell me the meaning of this! ,[Scarfish shows him a sandwich on a plate.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that sir? Why sir, that's a sea-cucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. A little booshie-amusie for the boys, sir. ,[Scarfish throws the sandwich away.],
,Captain Scarfish:, This is the navy, son! We don't cut the crusts off! We eat the crusts and throw the rest away! ,[Scarfish opens a trunk full of dangerous, moldy crusts and starts craving on it.],
,Mr. Krabs:, But that's... That's madness! ,[Mr. Krabs tabs on the captain's shoulder. The captain turns around as he is chewing on the moldy crusts. He swallows the crusts.],
,Captain Scarfish:, I'm telling you for the last time! You're gonna have to stop making your food so delicious!
,Mr. Krabs:, But I don't know how!
,Captain Scarfish:, Well, you better figure it out! I need my men ,[stretches his face], wide-eyed and hungry, Krabs! We've got a cargo-hold full of suntan lotion! And... ,[Squidward interrupts],
,Squidward:, Wait, you were transporting suntan lotion? ,[laughs], What SPF? ,[continues laughing],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship ,[cuts back to the ship sailing in pirate territory where a sailor is swabbing the deck], heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed. ,[Squidward yawns], Chafed, Mr. Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, Chafed! ,[cuts back to ship],
,Captain Scarfish:, Chafed!
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye, sir! I understand, sir! Chafed!
,Captain Scarfish:, So, tonight's meal is gonna be terrible! You understand, me?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye, sir!
,Captain Scarfish:, The worst you've ever made!
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye-aye, sir!
,Captain Scarfish:, ,[turns around and pulls his shirt up. As he talks, his back forms a shape of a steel bar on his back], The kind of slop that will put some steel in their spines!
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye-aye, sir!
,Captain Scarfish:, Either that or I'll throw you in the brig! ,[Scarfish walks away],
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, sir. ,[cuts to the captain's crew sitting at the table waiting for their food. Mr. Krabs walks in the dining room with the slop.],
,Crew:, Huzzah!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, don't ""huzzah"" yet, boys.
,Lou:, What's on the menu tonight, eh?
,Mr. Krabs:, Slop. ,[The crew laughs],
,Lou:, Oh, slop, eh? Good one! Why don't you put some of that delicious slop right here on my... ,[Mr. Krabs dishes up some slop on Lou's plate], Oh. I bet it's one of those things that looks bad, but it tastes really... ,[Lou tastes the slop but swallows it in disgust.], Bad.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, sorry boys. ,[Mr. Krabs dishes the slop to the other sailors. He groans while serving the food.], Captain's orders. ,[Unfortunately, the crew doesn't like the slop and looks at Mr. Krabs in anger. Mr. Krabs becomes fed up with the captain's cruel orders.], Oh, I can't stand it! ,[Turns around and suits up like a soldier going for battle.], I don't care what the captain says! ,[He hits the service cart and turns the slop into pizza dough. He flips the dough a couple times and chops it up with a spatula, which then turns into a more, delectable meal for the crew.],
,Crew:, ,[gasps], Huzzah! Huzzah for Mr. Krabs! Huzzah! ,[Suddenly, Captain Scarfish bursts in, ruining the moment.],
,Captain Scarfish:, What's all this ""huzzahing"" about?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, nothing sir! Uh, they just really enjoy eating slop! Don't you, boys? ,[The crew mushes the delectable meal into slop to hide it from the captain.],
,Captain Scarfish:, Attention! ,[The crew salutes in fear. Captain Scarfish examines the food.], Looks like slop alright. But what's this? ,[Shows a bowl full of ice cream with raspberry syrup and a cherry.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Cherries jubilee.
,Crew:, Cherries jubilee!
,Captain Scarfish:, Cherries jubilee?!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, flaming cherries jubilee.
,Captain Scarfish:, Flaming?! What are you trying to pull, you lubber? This looks like regular cherries jubilee!
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you see, sir, I was just gonna take this here match and... ,[Lights a match and blows the flame on the cherries jubilee. This sets it on fire and the captain is burned in the face. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs locked in a prison cell.], And so, I found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move. ,[A strange shadow appears on the wall next to the cell.], The one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare! ,[The shadow gets smaller and reveals to be a guard that looks like Squidward who is playing his clarinet.],
,Octopus Sailor:, Grr, what are you looking at? ,[The Octopus Sailor skips away as he continues playing his clarinet. As he skips away, a guard that looks like SpongeBob named Ensign is sitting, playing with a toy boat.],
,Mr. Krabs:, But I thought I could dupe the other one sure than need a rise. ,[The SpongeBob guard puts the boat toy in his head and forms a race track with his tongue. The boat slides out and the Ensign giggles. The scene changes back to SpongeBob laughing.],
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Mr. Krabs. That second guard sounds like a real goofball.
,Mr. Krabs:, I managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. You see, he was an aspiring cook and I talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. The tombs of me trade you might say. ,[The scene changes to the SpongeBob guard making something out of cotton candy.], I set him to work on a sponge-sugared cathedral that took up most of his attention. ,[Mr. Krabs takes some cotton candy and makes a key out of it.], He never suspected that I was using the scraps to fashion a candy-key. Where's your sourpuss friend tonight?
,Ensign:, Sick in bed like all the men. The captain's been feeding them nothing but moldy, old sandwich crusts. ,[Ensign makes cotton candy from the machine.], They've all got terrible bellyaches. But not me, though. I cook for myself.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wise lad. ,[Mr. Krabs finishes making the candy-key as Ensign eats some cotton candy. This gives him a major league sugar rush.], And so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off. ,[Ensign stops bouncing around and quickly falls asleep.], And soon, he was napping like a baby. This was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom. ,[Mr. Krabs goes to unlock himself out of his cell, but thinks for a minute and looks at Captain Scarfish's picture.], But did I dare take it? I'd be in violation of the naval code. Then something happened that made me mind up for me. ,[A cannonball appears out of nowhere and hits the wall.], Pirates! We were under attack! ,[Mr. Krabs frees himself from his cell.], I had to act fast! ,[He picks up Ensign and shakes him.], Wake up, lad! Wake up! Man your battle stations! ,[Ensign falls back to sleep. Mr. Krabs runs to the sickbay to get help, but the Octopus Sailor and the entire crew were to sick and weak to do anything.], I was on me own. ,[Mr. Krabs takes a telescope and sees a pirate ship and an island with the shipwreck sailors on it.], I could see it all. A pirate ship! And on that island: a crew of five naval men! Our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates! ,[He imagines them being flipped and sizzled in a frying pan.], And suffered from the effects of chafe! Sunburn! ,[Then a boat with pirates are shown rowing towards the cargo ship. On the boat, their captain looks a lot like Sandy Cheeks.], The pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel!
,Pirate Captain:, Row, you worthless dogs!
,Captain Scarfish:, ,[Captain Scarfish bursts through the door.], Stand down, Krabs! I'll have you on irons! ,[He holds up two irons with steam coming out from the bottoms.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!
,Captain Scarfish:, We're not outfitted for battle, Krabs! There's no ammunition! The cannons are ornamental at best! ,[He shows a fancy-looking gold cannon with a candlestick holder on it.], Ornamental at best!
,Mr. Krabs:, Then listen carefully! We'll have to go down to the cargo-hold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship!
,Captain Scarfish:, What you're suggesting is mutiny! ,[Suddenly, someone flings something on the captain's hat, making one of his hat decorations fall off. It turns out to be Ensign.],
,Ensign:, Do as he says, captain!
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you using for ammo there, Ensign?
,Ensign:, Oh, I rolled up an old, moldy sandwich crust into a hard, little ball. ,[Ensign takes a moldy crust and forms a ball.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[This give Mr. Krabs an idea.], That's it! ,[Mr. Krabs pushes Scarfish.], Come with me, lad! ,[Ensign and Mr. Krabs takes some moldy, old sandwich crusts and makes them into cannonballs. Mr. Krabs stuffs the moldy crust cannonball in the ornamental cannon. Ensign fires the cannonball at the ship which easily destroys it.], Direct hit!
,Mr. Krabs and Ensign:, Huzzah! ,[But the pirate captain and her crew invades the ship.],
,Pirate Captain:, You'll pay for that! Get 'em boys! ,[The pirates begin to attack.],
,Ensign:, Uh, what do I do?
,Mr. Krabs:, Get down to the cargo-hold and check on the captain! ,[Mr. Krabs uses his telescope as a sword as SpongeBob goes for the captain.], Charge! Hup! Hey! Whoop! Whoa! Hi-yah! Woo! ,[He whacks the pirate on the head.], Close one! Ha-ha! ,[He continues to fight as the pirate captain sits and watches with a cup of root beer in her hand.],
,Pirate Captain:, Aww, he's kinda handsome for a crusty old cuss.
,Captain Scarfish:, ,[Scarfish weeps as Ensign finds him in the cargo-hold.], I can't do it. I'm weak.
,Ensign:, Snap out of it, man! ,[Ensign slaps Scarfish, but to his surprise, the scar was a fake. Scarfish gasps and Ensign finds his scar on his hand.], Eeww!
,Captain Scarfish:, My personality! ,[Scarfish continues crying.],
,Ensign:, Oh, uh, let me put that back. ,[He slaps Scarfish again and his scar is back on his face, much to Scarfish's happiness. Ensign takes a sword and climbs to the top of the barrel and pokes a big hole on it. Releasing a huge torrent of suntan lotion which sweeps away Scarfish. Ensign swings to the ship's haul and makes an opening for the torrent. The suntan lotion with Scarfish on it surfs towards the island with the five naval fish on it. The lotion successfully cured them from their sunburns.],
,Naval Fish:, Oh my! This feels wonderful! Yes, it feels great! ,[The naval fish gets up and swims to the cargo ship to rescue Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Mr. Krabs continues fighting the pirates.], Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me! ,[He fights until he loses his telescope.], Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?
,Pirate Captain:, Finish him off! ,[Just as Mr. Krabs was about to meet his end, the naval fish appears.],
,Naval Fish:, Huzzah for Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha-ha! The sunburn brigade! ,[The naval fish traps the pirates in a net.], Ha-ha! Me plan worked! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!
,Pirate Captain:, Handsome and clever, I see. ,[She blinks at him for a few seconds, but instead of releasing her, Mr. Krabs puts her in the prison cell.], Join me, Krabs! We'll rule the seven seas together!
,Mr. Krabs:, I can't let you go, lass. That'll be violation of the naval code. Enjoy your last meal. I hope you like sponge-sugar! ,[Mr. Krabs winks at her as he gives her a pie. The pirate captain begins to eat the pie and finds something in it.],
,Pirate Captain:, Huh? ,[It turns out to be the candy-key he made earlier.], Oh! ,[She giggles as she and Mr. Krabs wink at Ensign, who made a cotton candy sculpture of the Statue of Liberty. Then it cuts back to the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob winking at each other.],
,Squidward:, What are we all winking about?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know! ,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs continues to wink, much to Squidward's annoyance.],

"Sandy:, There we go! ,[Sandy rakes a pile of leaves in the shape of Texas], SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra... ,[steps on piles of leaves still on the ground], SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!
,SpongeBob:, ,[peeks his head out of a pile of leaves he is in], I am raking the leaves.
,Sandy:, But they're still all over the ground!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, I can't rake any faster. ,[picks up a leaf and starts scraping it with a tiny rake], These are big leaves. ,[leaf breaks into more pieces], And they keep breaking into more leaves.
,Sandy:, ,[Sandy pushes him away and rakes them herself], Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late!
,SpongeBob:, What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
,Sandy:, ,[hanging laundry], I told ya, SpongeBob... ,[scrubs the birdbath with a toothbrush], I'm hibernating next week.
,SpongeBob:, Hibernating? What's that?
,Sandy:, ,[painting the fence], It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.
,SpongeBob:, Can I do that?
,Sandy:, ,[chuckles], No, silly. It's a mammalian thing. ,[paints over SpongeBob's helmet],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
,Sandy:, ,[cleaning her exercise wheel], Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!
,SpongeBob:, Why, Sandy? When does your... ""carburation"" begin? ,[Sandy jumps down, pulling down a giant calendar with a giant x on the 8th],
,Sandy:, In one week!
,SpongeBob:, But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3... ,[gasps], 168 more hours of playtime!
,Sandy:, You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!
,SpongeBob:, Climb!
,Sandy:, We gotta jump off of stuff!

,SpongeBob:, Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. ,[Pantera playing],
,Sandy:, Well, I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands! ,[holds them up. Cut to the giant sand mountains area. Sandy is riding a giant clam shell smashing through a sign], Yee-ha! ,[sliding down the mountain so fast she is now on fire. She rides past a fish with a backpack on his back. When she goes past him, he drops to the ground and rolls around cause he is on fire. She then rides past a man and a woman. The woman now wears a jogging outfit and the man is now riding a tricycle and holding a lollipop and paddleball. The woman looks at him],
,Unnamed Fish #1:, Uh... I can explain. ,[Sandy flips in mid-air, still on fire],
,Sandy:, I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo! ,[SpongeBob is wearing his green karate head gear and riding down the mountain on his tongue. Cut to two kids, building a sandman],

,SpongeBob:, Yeah. ,[cut to Sandy and SpongeBob standing outside Sandy's treedome], Whew, what a workout. ,[pulls out his right arm and shows its damages], I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. ,[his arm falls to the ground], Ow.
,Sandy:, I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best pre-hibernation week ever.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again. ,[sighs as he lifts up his left leg and moves it alternately with the other over to his house. Later, it's nighttime and he is finally crawling into bed], Good night, Gary. ,[falls asleep. Then Sandy pushes a button which launches SpongeBob out of his bed and into a lake. SpongeBob is now a block of ice. Sandy jumps in and becomes a block of ice],
,Sandy:, Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[shivering], W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? ,[Sandy pulls down a calendar],
,Sandy:, I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun. ,[swims away], Well, hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour! ,[cut to SpongeBob lifting a bowling ball into a tube. Sandy blows her whistle giving the signal and SpongeBob runs to the end and picks up a few jacks before the bowling ball hits him on his head.

,SpongeBob:, Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before! ,[cut to Sandy and SpongeBob with giant q-tips],
,Sandy:, Okay, SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun. We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off. ,[lifts hers up], On your mark... get set...

,Sandy:, Go! ,[hits SpongeBob off the Sea Needle. SpongeBob lands on a fire hydrant. Sandy rides up on a two-seated bike], Come on, SpongeBob. We're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!

,Sandy:, I did, SpongeBob, the industrial park! ,[they ride into a giant factory], This is where the real action is! ,[Sandy pedals on barbed wire], This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on! ,[they ride through a conveyor belt with a giant crunching mouth at the end], I hope we make it! ,[bike begins to fall to the ground fast. SpongeBob screams], I'm havin' fun, too! ,[as they hit the ground, SpongeBob melts into a puddle.

,SpongeBob:, Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of... ,[his mouth melts away from his eyes. He pulls it back up], I just feel like maybe I need to... ,[his mouth melts away again. Sandy puts her hand over his mouth],
,Sandy:, Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite! ,[holds up a piece of hay. Pantera plays again], Find the hay in the needle stack! ,[throws it in a giant pile of needles.

,Squidward:, How about a break?! We've been at it for days!
,Debbie:, Think about the children!
,Sandy:, That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.

,Sandy:, I heard that! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!
,Frank:, Uh... uh, wait! ,[picks up Francis], Uh, here he is!

,Squidward:, ,[pops out from under the rock], Oh, look, it is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open. ,[Sandy turns around],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams in horror], C'mon, let me back in! You don't understand! ,[Sandy hugs SpongeBob],
,Sandy:, Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened! ,[grabs his arm], Come on. There's just enough time to go atom smashing. ,[Sandy runs but SpongeBob is not moving],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, wait!
,Sandy:, There's no time to wait! Hibernation! ,[pulls on SpongeBob's arm],
,SpongeBob:, Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important! ,[Sandy lets go of SpongeBob's arm], I...am a man! ,[holds up a razor], Okay, Sandy, I...I...I...I...I can't play with you anymore! I just can't take the games! They're tearing me apart! ,[rips off his nose and throws it on the ground, then holds onto Sandy's legs crying], There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I...

,[SpongeBob enters the Palace of Pranks and smells the air.],
,SpongeBob:, Ah! ,[Patrick enters the scene.], Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items. ,[An aisle is shown.], Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see! ,[He walks down an aisle.], Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?
,Patrick:, ,[in another aisle], Hey, Seanut Brittle! ,[Purple tubes appear popping above the aisle that Patrick is in.], Oh, darn it, not again!
,[The scene only shows SpongeBob in his aisle. SpongeBob laughs. An old fish named Frank enters the scene.],
,Frank:, Good to see you, SpongeBob. How's my number one customer doing?
,SpongeBob:, Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too.
,Frank:, ,[Walking up to Patrick], Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick. ,[shakes Patrick's hand, but Frank has a joy buzzer, so it shocks Patrick. Patrick screams and sucks on his hand. Frank laughs.], That's your first lesson, son, the granddaddy of all pranks. The joy buzzer.
,Patrick:, I don't get it.
,Frank:, You don't have to get it. The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.
,SpongeBob:, You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him.,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk to the checkout counter and Frank is behind it.], Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got.
,Frank:, Well, this came in just this morning. ,[shows package of gum], Have some gum. ,[Patrick chews the gum but then he screams as his head explodes.], Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.
,Patrick:, ,[His head is gone, leaving a neck bone in the shape of a femur], I don't get it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes out a dollar.], What can we get for one dollar?
,Frank:, One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar-- ,[He takes out a fake dollar], fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.
,SpongeBob:, What else have you got?
,[Frank holds up a whoopee cushion.],
,Frank:, A whoopee cushion.
,SpongeBob:, Nah.
,[Frank holds up fake vomit.],
,Frank:, Fake vomit.
,SpongeBob:, No.
,[Part of the counter is covered in real vomit.],
,Frank:, Real vomit?
,SpongeBob:, Eww! Don't you have anything good?
,Frank:, Well, there is one prank that I've been saving for a real top of the line prankster. ,[Shows close up of spray can], Invisible Spray!
,SpongeBob:, Wow, invisible spray!
,Patrick:, But I can see it.
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this.
,[SpongeBob gives Frank some money.],
,Frank:, Good choice. Now be careful with that stuff, boys. It stains clothes.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Frank. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk off-screen. The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Patrick outside.], Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray.
,Patrick:, What are we gonna do with it?
,SpongeBob:, I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair.
,[They both think about sitting on an invisible bench, surrounded by Nat, Tom, Tina-Fran, Horace, Halber, and Shelia.],
,Nat:, They're floating in midair!
,Tina-Fran:, How do they do that?
,[The thought bubble disappears.],
,Patrick:, That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!
,[Patrick gives SpongeBob a thumbs up.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, let's get started.
,[Patrick takes off his shorts.],
,Patrick:, Okay, I'm ready.
,[Patrick drops his pants on the ground.],
,SpongeBob:, Any particular reason you took your pants off?
,Patrick:, Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?
,SpongeBob:, That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second. ,[Patrick takes the can of spray while SpongeBob takes off his pants. Patrick hugs the can.], Okay, Patrick, give me the can.
,Patrick:, I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea.
,Patrick:, Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!
,SpongeBob:, Give me that thing.
,[SpongeBob grabs the can and he and Patrick wrestle over it. SpongeBob accidentally sprays their clothes and they disappear],
,Patrick:, Hey, the invisible spray works!
,[A tour bus drives up.],
,Tom:, And on your right, if you look, you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint!
,[The passengers laugh and Tom laugh. The bus drives off. SpongeBob covers his lower half],
,SpongeBob:, Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!
,[SpongeBob pats the ground, trying to grab the clothes. Patrick sprays SpongeBob's right hand and it disappears],
,Patrick:, I gotta ,hand, it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.
,[Patrick laughs and SpongeBob screams.],
,SpongeBob:, Righty, where are you? ,[Patrick laughs again.], No one messes with Righty! ,[He takes the spray can with his invisible hand.], We'll see how you like it! ,[sprays Patrick making a hole in the middle of his body], Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?
,[Patrick takes the can.],
,Patrick:, Yeah. ,[He sprays SpongeBob's upper left corner.], I see what you mean.
,[SpongeBob takes the spray can and sprays Patrick's lower half.],
,SpongeBob:, No guts, no glory! ,[laughs],
,Narrator:, Several bad puns later...
,[The scene returns to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are now invisible. Patrick shakes the can.],
,Patrick:, Oh, hey, I think this thing is empty.
,[SpongeBob grabs the can and shakes it.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it.
,[SpongeBob throws the can far away.],
,Patrick:, Hey, I think I found our pants. ,[A ripping noise is heard.], Oops! Here, these are yours.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk off somewhere.],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?
,SpongeBob:, Oh sure, it's...half past invisible.
,Patrick:, Gee, it's getting late.
,[They walk up behind Nat.],
,SpongeBob:, Let's ask this guy. Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?
,Nat:, Sure. ,[looks at his watch], It's, uh, ten to three.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you.
,Nat:, Don't mention it.
,[Nat turns around to notice there is seemingly no one there.],
,Patrick:, Don't mention what?
,Nat:, Uh, who said that?
,Patrick:, Me.
,Nat:, ,[screams], Ghosts!
,[Nat runs away from them; his eyes pop out. His eyes scream, jump into a car and drive away.],
,Patrick:, Hey, I'm no ghost! The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.
,SpongeBob:, Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea.
,Patrick:, Lay it on me.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, we're invisible, right?
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Whoo! High five!
,[They give each other a high five],
,SpongeBob:, Let's go scare us some suckers!
,[The scene changes to show Sandy's treedome. The scene then shows her reading a book in a rocking chair in her tree. She hears a noise, which is SpongeBob and Patrick's laughter. She checks to see what it is, but there is supposedly nothing there. She gets up and goes to her window.],
,Sandy:, Huh? ,[the outside of her tree is shown.], Well, that's funny, I thought I heard voices. Huh? ,[She walks up to a glass of juice on the floor.], I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table. ,[She walks over to a table with a lamp covered in garbage.], And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?
,[Photos of Patrick are on the walls and tables, the rug has his face on them. Sandy turns around and sees SpongeBob and Patrick covered in white sheets over their heads as they wail.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, We're ghosts.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick wail again. Sandy laughs.],
,Sandy:, I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets. ,[She pulls off the sheets and notices there is nothing there. She gasps.], It is ghosts!
,[Sandy screams. She takes out a remote with a large red button. She pressed the button and an escape pod that is in the shape of an acorn appears out of some panels. She enters the escape pod and presses a button. The escape pod flies out of her dome, above the water, past the Bikini Bottom island, and lands in Texas. The escape pod explodes in Texas. SpongeBob and Patrick leave Sandy's house, laughing.],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, we really scared her!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.],
,Patrick:, Who's gonna be our next victim?
,SpongeBob:, A better question would be, ""Who isn't?""
,[The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff's house, where she is preparing to eat a piece of cake.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake! ,[laughs], You will soon be mine. ,[Patrick and possibly SpongeBob eats/eat the cake, making it look like ghosts have eaten it. Patrick's face is covered in cake. He belches loudly and wipes it off.], Oh! ,[gets filled up with air and then lets it out flying all around], Ghosts!
,[Her deflated body lands on the table. The scene changes to show Squidward painting and humming to himself at his house. SpongeBob and/or Patrick takes the paintbrush, making it look like it is floating in mid air.],
,Squidward:, Huh?
,[SpongeBob and/or Patrick paint(s) a mustache under Squidward's nose. The two wail ghostly. Squidward crashes through the wall and runs away.],
,Squidward:, Ghosts! 
,[The scene changes to show Bill surfing at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob and Patrick surf up to Bill, making it look like a surfboard is on a wave by itself.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[Speaking in a ghostly voice], Cowabunga!
,Bill:, Ghosts!
,[Bill screams while falling off the board.],
,[Debbie appears waving her arms wildly.],
,Debbie:, Ghosts!
,[Fred appears with his eyes bugging out of his head.],
,Fred:, Ghosts!
,[Lonnie appears, scared with arms on his head.],
,Lonnie:, Ghosts!
,[Francis appears in a sort of screaming position.],
,Francis:, Ghosts!
,[Sandals appears holding a piece of toast.],
,Sandals:, Toast.
,[Harold appears sitting on the toilet, appearing freaked out.],
,Harold:, Ghosts!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick are reading newspapers. SpongeBob laughs.],
,SpongeBob:, It's official-- we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts.
,[Patrick is holding his newspaper upside down],
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom-- ,[An article is shown it reads, ""Krabs Last To Be Haunted! says, 'I ain't afraid of no ghosts'""], Mr. Krabs.
,[The same article is shown on Patrick's paper, but it is upside down.],
,Patrick:, It says he isn't scared of ghosts.
,[SpongeBob is ""shown""],
,SpongeBob:, We'll see about that!
,[The scene changes to show the Krusty Krab at night. Mr. Krabs peers out of the blinds.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief... ,[grabs a handkerchief], And his dried-up sea leprechaun. ,[shows ashes of the sea leprechaun], And a bit of gold never hurt. ,[shows a gold necklace around Mr. Krabs neck that reads, ""Foxy""], But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot, ,[his underwear is strung up with rope], got me shivering timber brace, ,[shows his ankles chained together], and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down. ,[a strip of duct tape covers the hair. Mr. Krabs is shown wearing a barrel and a headpiece with lanterns hung on it.], And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor. And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon—the specter deflector! ,[holds up a paddle ball], So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on. 
,[The lights black turn off. SpongeBob and Patrick wail ghostly.],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[As they open the front door], Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Wha? 
,[SpongeBob and Patrick toss over a table and barrel. They pick up a barrel and a table to make it look like they are floating.],
,SpongeBob:, Krabs, we've come to haunt you.
,[Mr. Krabs uses the specter detector (paddle ball) by bouncing the stringed ball back and forth from the paddle board.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Stay back, I'm well-armed!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick moan ghostly. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by with a barrel, making it look like it is floating by. Mr. Krabs hits the ball faster.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm warning ya!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick moan. SpongeBob or Patrick stops the ball. SpongeBob or Patrick then cuts the string.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shivering], Ooh!
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[quietly], Boo.
,[Mr. Krabs breaks out of his armor and screams.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I gotta get out of here!
,[He runs to the doors, but they don't open.],
,SpongeBob:, You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.
,[The door is held closed with a long strip of glue. The scene shows the side of the Krusty Krab.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[off-screen], You'll never get me!
,[Mr. Krabs tries to break through the window, but instead of shattering, the window stretches like elastic and slingshots him backwards, and he crashes into a table],
,Patrick:, Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber!
,[Mr. Krabs dives into the toilet, but gets stuck. He pulls himself out and sits on the floor, dazed],
,SpongeBob:, Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets. ,[The toilet is stuffed with toilet paper. Mr. Krabs cowers in a corner.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Please, spirits, leave me be.
,[Patrick laughs.],
,Patrick:, ,[while Mr. Krabs is incoherently begging for his life], We got him good, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[while Mr. Krabs is incoherently begging for his life], Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea. ,[to Mr. Krabs], You're going to pay, Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[shaking with fear], No, spirits, please! 
,SpongeBob:, Pay!
,[a dollar floats in the air],
,Mr. Krabs:, No!
,SpongeBob:, ,[high-picthed], Pay! ,[lights a match],
,Mr. Krabs:, No! Don't burn me dollar! ,[He takes a bucket of water and throws it at the dollar. The water drips on SpongeBob and Patrick, making them reappear. They laugh, not noticing they're visible.], Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, ,[wiggling his arms and legs like a ghost], I know not these names of which you speak.
,[Patrick looks down and notices that he is visible.],
,Patrick:, Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again. ,[SpongeBob looks down, then he and Patrick scream and cover their lower halves. Mr. Krabs lifts them up by the back of their necks as they try to run.],
,Mr. Krabs:, So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts.
,SpongeBob:, We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.
,[Mr. Krabs puts them down.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me. ,[They all laugh.], Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.
,[Mr. Krabs laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.
,Patrick:, Me too.
,Mr. Krabs:, Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[off-screen], Don't mention it.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the dining area.],
,SpongeBob:, That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy.
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,[a white, round light shines on SpongeBob and Patrick. The scene pans out to show a crowd of people consisting of: Tom, Bill, Mrs. Puff, Sandy, Squidward, Horace, Harold, Nathiel Waters, the red shirt Frank, Jimmy-Gus, Sadie, Nat, Nazz-Mimi, Purple Scooter, Dennis Rechid, Martin, an anchovy, two Frankie Billys, Clay, and Franco.],
,Mr. Krabs:, The Krusty Krab presents... live nude pranksters! ,[He is shown shining the light on them from the crow's nest], Starring the Bikini Bottom Ghosts!

,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Yeah?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Scene cuts to the outside of the Krusty Krab], We should have bought the whoopee cushion! ,[SpongeBob lets out a crying yell as the episode ends. Person wolf whistles in cheers.],

"SpongeBob:, ,[walking around in a small circle in Jellyfish Fields], Ahh, nothing quite like a relaxing stroll ,[deep voice], deep ,[normal], in Jellyfish Fields. ,[a high-pitched scream in the distance], I'd know that sound anywhere! It's a terrifying shriek! But where's it coming from? ,[he looks from behind a rock and finds Patrick shrieking], Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays.
,Patrick:, Sorry, SpongeBob. That wasn't me.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek.
,Patrick:, So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Patrick mimicking], So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don't do that. It is really...
,[terrifying shriek],
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute, if the shriek wasn’t coming from you, then where was it...it’s over there, behind that kelp shrub!
,[a giant clam behind the kelp bush is shrieking],
,SpongeBob:, The terrifying shriek must've come from this clam.
,[the clam starts coughing violently],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Patrick mimicking], Hey, Patrick, I think there's something wrong with...
,[clam coughing and wheezing],
,SpongeBob:, W-W-What are we gonna do?
,Patrick:, Well, the last time I remember coughing like that, I was sitting at home, eating a box of Kelp Jerky.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, and you were coughing because you got something stuck in your throat?
,Patrick:, I got the TV remote stuck in my throat!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, this clam is choking! Luckily, I come prepared! ,[pulls out a bottle of bubble soap], There, there, Clammy. ,[takes out bubble wand and spreads a line of soap under the clam’s bottom lip],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
,SpongeBob:, They like this!
,Patrick:, No! You always give a choking victim the Slimelich Maneuver, first! And if that doesn’t work, you walk away and pretend like you never saw them before. ,[walks behind the clam], Like this! Ready, clam?
,[grabs the clam, tries to lift it, sprains his back, and screams in pain],
,Patrick:, Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, what about the clam?
,Patrick:, What clam? I've never seen that clam before in my life.
,SpongeBob:, But if...
,[the clam spits out a pearl],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, the clam had a baby!
,Patrick:, That's not a baby, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Well, then, what could it be?
,Patrick:, I'll give you a hint: what's white, round, and comes out of clams?
,SpongeBob:, Their...eyes?
,Patrick:, No, silly! A volleyball!
,SpongeBob:, A baby volleyball!
,[at Bikini Bottom Volley Ball Courts and Appraisal Center],
,Harold:, I got it! Ugh!
,SpongeBob:, Good idea coming here, Patrick.
,Patrick:, That's my specialty.
,SpongeBob:, Having good ideas?
,Patrick:, No, being called Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, Maybe we should do some stretches, first.
,Patrick:, Good idea!
,SpongeBob:, Well, that's my specialty.
,Patrick:, Having good ideas?
,SpongeBob:, Nope, doing some stretches, first.
,[appraisal clerk talking on phone],
,Clerk:, Yeah... No... I don't know, the thing's a hundred years old, how should I know? Yeah, alright, look, if you don’t want it... ,[sees SpongeBob’s pearl. dreamily], Uh-huh... Yeah... We'll see... Huh, yeah. I'm... I'm... I'm still here. ,[hangs up],
,SpongeBob:, 138, 139,
,Clerk:, Gentlemen.
,SpongeBob:, Hello.
,Clerk:, I couldn't help noticing what a lovely ball that is.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, really?
,Clerk:, Yes. I’d sure like to get a closer look.
,SpongeBob:, We don’t mind, do we Patrick?
,Patrick:, Well, just don’t take too long. We were just about to start playing with it.
,Clerk:, Oh, it uh…it won’t take long at all. ,[picks up pearl], Ooh, it’s heavier than I imagined. And, uh, shinier, too. Where’d you find it?
,SpongeBob:, We found it deep in Jellyfish Fields.
,Clerk:, Really? What was it doing there?
,SpongeBob:, Choking a clam.
,Clerk:, Well, um…ahem…what would you say if I were to offer you a small fortune in exchange for your shiny ball?
,Patrick:, What do you mean, ‘small fortune?’
,[hundreds of trucks bring cash to SpongeBob’s house while SpongeBob and Patrick eat Kelp Jerky],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa. How many more trucks do you think there’ll be, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Huh? Oh, I don’t know. I am getting kinda hungry, though. I’ll catch up with you later, SpongeBob.
,[last truck leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Well, that looked like the last of them.
,Patrick:, The last of what?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, So, did you figure out what you’re gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?
,SpongeBob:, Yup…I mean, nope.
,Patrick:, Well, my dad always told me: when you have money, you need to do more than just spend it. You need to have a plan.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, your dad really told you that?
,Patrick:, Well, what he said was, ‘How many times do I have to tell you not to stand there?’ But I knew what he meant.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick, I know a good place to go when you don’t know what to buy.
,Patrick:, You do?
,SpongeBob:, The mall!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick go to the mall],
,Both:, Whoo!
,[SpongeBob throws a baseball glove at Patrick],
,Both:, Touchdown!
,[they go look at baby clams],
,Both:, Aw!
,[two bite at SpongeBob’s eyelids],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, where’d you go?
,[Patrick pulls off the clams],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, there you are.
,[they then go to listen to headphones. SpongeBob’s headphones work, but Patrick’s don’t play any music. He pulls at the cord without realizing that both their headphones are connected, and pulls off the top of SpongeBob’s head, revealing his brain. Patrick puts it back on, and SpongeBob puts his hand on Patrick’s shoulder. they head home],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, that was the best shopping day ever!
,Patrick:, You can say that again!
,SpongeBob:, Best shopping day ever! Patrick, I got an idea!
,Patrick:, Really?
,SpongeBob:, Let’s go shopping again! And this time, buy stuff!
,[they head home from the mall with shopping carts and money sticking out of their clothes],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, wasn’t that incredible, Patrick? I mean, with all this money, we could’ve bought anything in the whole world!
,Patrick:, Yup!
,SpongeBob:, So tell me, what’d you buy?
,Patrick:, A lifetime supply of strawberry gum!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, me, too! And to think we barely even put a dent in my fortune!
,Narrator:, The following Thursday...
,[at an ice cream stall],
,SpongeBob:, Two, please: one for me and one for my best friend, Patrick.
,Lou:, I didn’t really ask who they were for.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks. ,[gives him a wad of bills], There you go.
,Lou:, It was only fifty-nine cents for the ice cream.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that’s okay. I kinda have more money than I know what to do with right now.
,Lou:, Looks like my ex-wife was wrong. I am in the right line of work!
,Bill:, Uh, triple-blueberry sundae, please. Extra nuts.
,Lou:, Sure. That’s gonna be $2.98.
,Bill:, Uh…hey Bert, you got like eight cents I can borrow?
,Bert:, Yeah, let me check…no, I don’t, Bill, Sorry.
,Bill:, You know, why is it I always have money when you need to borrow it?
,Bert:, Well, I don’t know what to say…I…
,SpongeBob:, Are you gentlemen low on funds? Let me help. ,[gives wad to Bill], Here you go.
,Bill:, Whoa. Uh, t-that’s okay, I just need eight cents.

,SpongeBob:, Sure thing. Do you need some, too, Bert?
,Bert:, Okay!
,Dale:, Excuse me, can I have some, too?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you wanna buy some ice cream?
,Dale:, No, I’m allergic. But, I’ll be you’re best friend.
,SpongeBob:, It’s a deal!
,Bill:, Hey, I think I can hang out with this guy for a while.
,Bert:, Me, too!
,Dale:, Me, too!
,Lou:, Me, three!
,[crowd leaves with SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, Ice cream?
,[Patrick knocks on SpongeBob’s new mansion],
,Butler:, Hmm…yes?
,Patrick:, Uh…I’m here to see SpongeBob.
,Butler:, I know, you on the guest list, sir?
,Patrick:, Well, I don’t think so. Normally, I…
,Butler:, Well, then, I’m afraid I can’t let you in, sir. Good day, sir.
,Patrick:, Good day. Uh, your shoe’s untied.
,Butler:, Hmm, right-o, it is. ,[Patrick walks inside], Thank you, sir.
,Bert:, And so, he was like, do you wanna buy some ice cream? Ha ha, ice cream! Can you imagine?
,Bill:, Ha ha, yeah. Ah, I love that story!
,Patrick:, Uh, hey guys. Have you seen SpongeBob around?
,Bert:, Eh…is that guy talking to us?
,Bill:, Just don’t move. Or breathe. He might go away.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
,Nat Peterson:, Hey, pal, watch it. I can buy and sell you!
,SpongeBob:, And I said, go ahead, let’s do it right now! I got too much hair, anyways.
,[crowd laughs],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, That’s my name, don’t wear it out.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I gotta tell you something I think you should know: your house is full of strangers!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick, these aren’t strangers. These are 497 of my closest friends. Right everybody? ,[crowd cheers], That right!
,[SpongeBob throws cash in the air and the crowd cheers and grabs for it],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, do you hear that? That is the sound of love.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, if you keep throwing your money away like that, you won’t have any left to…
,Mr. Krabs:, Excuse me sir, is this man giving you trouble?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Like I was saying…
,Patrick:, But…
,Mr. Krabs:, We don’t want any trouble, now just keep moving.
,Teenage fish:, Dude, how do you get in there?
,SpongeBob:, And I told him, it’s not that I mind the macaroni, what I mind is…
,Mr. Krabs:, Sorry about that, SpongeBob. Won’t happen again.
,SpongeBob:, No matter, he’s simply jealous of my glamorous new lifestyle.
,Mr. Krabs:, Say, that reminds me…can I have some money?
,SpongeBob:, Why certainly. I always remember to… ,[pulls out empty pocket. Crowd gasps], Oh, I forgot. I keep it in this other pocket. ,[empty pocket. Crowd gasps], Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?
,[SpongeBob goes around checking his safe, piggy bank, golden toilet, and Gary’s shell. He has no money left],
,SpongeBob:, Noooooooooo! ,[walks back to party], Well, everyone, I hope this doesn’t put a damper on things, but I just checked and, well it’s just that all my money is… ,[everyone is gone], …gone.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don’t be late for work tomorrow, boy.
,[Patrick’s rock, where Patrick is relaxing],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Oh, hey SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Whatcha doing?
,Patrick:, Oh, the same thing us sea stars are usually doing, I guess. Laying up against a rock.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I was wrong.
,Patrick:, About what?
,SpongeBob:, The money, and about those people being my friends.
,Patrick:, There is no right or wrong when it comes to that stuff, SpongeBob. There just either ‘is’ or there ‘isn’t.’
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, if having a bunch of money makes me forget that forget that you’re my best friend, then I don’t want anymore money, ever again.
,Patrick:, Well, why didn’t you say so, buddy? I’ve been waiting for someone to go break in my new volleyball with!
,SpongeBob:, You got another new volleyball?
,Patrick:, Yup, I found it!
,SpongeBob:, Found it? Where?
,Patrick:, Inside the Bikini Bottom Diamond Mine!

"[episode starts at the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is grumbling],
,Plankton:, What is going on here?! ,[screams, and rips off some of his skin, then Karen comes out],
,Karen:, What's wrong now?
,Plankton:, Same as always, look! Empty again.
,Karen:, So what are ya gonna do about it?
,Plankton:, I don't know anymore. ,[cries],
,Karen:, ,[fake cries], Why don't you just work on a new recipe?
,Plankton:, What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years! ,[Nat walks in],
,Nat:, Hello.
,Plankton:, Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?
,Nat:, Sorry, I just wanted a Chum Stick.
,Plankton:, ,[eye pops out in shock], What?!
,Nat:, Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks.
,Plankton:, You're kidding right?
,Nat:, No, I'm serious, I want a Chum Stick.
,Plankton:, Uh, okay if you insist. ,[hands him a Chum Stick, and Nat eats it], Oh no, please don't sue me. ,[Nat finishes the whole thing and says: Mmm-mmm!], I can't believe someone actually enjoys my chum. ,[laughs],
,Nat:, Now this was so good, I'm going to have to come back tomorrow. ,[hands him a dollar], Here you go. See you in the morning.
,Plankton:, ,[to Karen], Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!
,Karen:, How'd you pull that off?
,Plankton:, Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more. ,[cuts to the next day, Plankton comes running out of the Kitchen with a Chum Stick], Now, I wait. I wait until he returns. ,[hops up on a stool, and stares out the window], I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait.
,Narrator:, 8 hours later... ,[Plankton is asleep, then the clock wakes him up],
,Plankton:, Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What? ,[sees the clock], Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true.
,Nat:, Hey.
,Plankton:, Well hello, Nat.
,Nat:, I came back like I said yesterday.
,Plankton:, You certainly did, didn't you?
,Nat:, I'd like another Chum Stick, please?
,Plankton:, Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here.
,Nat:, Oh, boy! ,[eats it],
,Plankton:, Is it okay?
,Nat:, ,[angry], Okay? ,[happy], It's perfection! ,[both laugh, and then do a high five], Hey, how about I have another?
,Plankton:, You bet 'ya. ,[gives Nat another one, and he eats it],
,Nat:, Whoo, boy! I cannot believe how good these things are.
,Plankton:, Oh, well, you know.
,Nat:, All right, see you tomorrow. ,[hand him another dollar],
,Plankton:, What? You're coming back again?
,Nat:, Oh, you know it! And the day after that, and the next week after that! You've got a regular customer on your hands! ,[walks out],
,Plankton:, Oh my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge! ,[laughs evilly, then cuts to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is laughing],
,Mr. Krabs:, ♪Rolling, rolling rolling. Money keeps on rolling.♪ ,[playing bowling with money], One more time! ,[notices Plankton], No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time, or any time! ,[throws him on the counter, then gets a spoon, and crushes him],
,Plankton:, Don't bother. There's no need.
,Mr. Krabs:, What are you talking about?
,Plankton:, ,[slides out of the spoon], I'm just saying I no longer need to copy you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], You're really funny man! You think you can compete with me? Look Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, Plankton, not to you!
,Nat:, Hey Plankton, can I get another one of your delicious Chum Sticks?
,Plankton:, But of course, loyal customer. ,[hops out of Mr. Krabs' hands, onto Nat's hand], I'll see you later, loser. Much later! ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir!
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food. You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you can count on me sir. ,[cuts to Nat walking toward the Chum Bucket], Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here. ,[SpongeBob is laying on the floor, like a mat], Why settle for Plankton's lumpy Chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?
,Nat:, ,[sniffs it, shakes in disgust], No thanks. ,[opens the door, peeling off SpongeBob's skin],
,SpongeBob:, Barnacles! ,[cuts to SpongeBob in a chair], There he is. Just in time for breakfast. ,[SpongeBob walks down the street, then throws a rock on the ground], Oh, I am such a clumsy oath. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here. ,[deliberately trips over the rock], Oh, no! Too late! No! No! ,[tries to shove in his mouth, but his mouth dodges every time], Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later.
,Nat:, Yeah, do me a favor. ,[rips off SpongeBob's pants, uses it as a napkin, then gives it back], From now on, keep those Shabby Patties to yourself. ,[walks away],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, fishpaste! ,[cuts to the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen, babe, fetch Nat another plate of that sweet Chum.
,Karen:, Yes, your diminutiveness. ,[goes in the kitchen],
,Plankton:, Say, Nat, do you have any friends?
,Nat:, Nope. ,[Plankton sings a little, then laughs],
,Plankton:, Would you hurry up with that Chum, Karen?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[imitating Karen], Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop. ,[throws a Krabby Patty], There's your Chum, bleep blap blop.
,Nat:, Hey, this doesn't look like Chum.
,Plankton:, And that doesn't look like Karen. ,[SpongeBob looks like Karen],
,SpongeBob:, Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me.
,Plankton:, What have you done with Karen, you brute?! ,[cut to the kitchen, where Karen is taped up],
,Nat:, How many times do I have to tell you? ,[throws the Krabby Patty away], I don't want to eat your trash! Plankton's chum is my favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I love chum! So forget it! I don't want to eat anything else! ,[SpongeBob returns to normal, and speaks in normal voice],
,SpongeBob:, So you're saying that you love Chum? And all that you ever eat is Chum?
,Nat:, Yeah! Th-that's right!
,SpongeBob:, Interesting. ,[walks away, scene then cuts to Nat walking out of a trailer. He notices a hole with a sign that says ""Shortcut 2 Chum Bucket""],
,Nat:, A shortcut to the Chum Bucket? Hmm. That must be for me. ,[whistles as he goes through the hole, and it leads to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs:, Welcome, valued customer.
,Nat:, This isn't the Chum Bucket.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Why go to the Chum Bucket, when the Krusty Krab is adding tasty Chum to our menu?
,Nat:, That's okay, I only eat Chum Bucket brand Chum.
,Mr. Krabs:, But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning Chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say? ,[Nat eats it, then spits it out], You like it?
,Nat:, It's...
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah?
,Nat:, It's... ,[coughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, what do you think?
,Nat:, It's the second foulest thing I've ever tasted! ,[vomits in a sick and angry mood off screen], I'm going back to Plankton's Chum. ,[crawls away],
,Mr. Krabs:, What am I going to do? I can't let Plankton have so much as one single customer! ,[cries], I just can't afford it.
,SpongeBob:, I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's.
,Mr. Krabs:, But to do that, I need to know how Plankton makes his Chum. ,[gets an idea], That's it boyo! ,[cuts to the Chum Bucket at night time. Mr. Krabs sneaks over and uses a flamethrower to cut his way through the Chum Bucket metal wall, allowing him to get inside], Where could it be? ,[notices the safe], There! Plankton's secret formula. ,[tries to open it], It's gotta be in here... ,[an alarm goes off, and he gets crushed by a giant spoon],
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal ,my, secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?
,Mr. Krabs:, Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony.
,Plankton:, Ouch, double irony! ,[SpongeBob picks him up],
,SpongeBob:, Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist. ,[Plankton groans], I mean just think about that. ,[presses a button on his remote], You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the... ,[SpongeBob gets crushed by a giant spoon],
,Plankton:, Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation.
,Karen:, Call it a computer's intuition, but I sense your regular approaching, with an unusually large wad of cash.
,Mr. Krabs:, Look at all that loot!
,Plankton:, That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my Chum!
,Mr. Krabs:, D'oh, just put me out of me misery! ,[Nat walks in, angered],
,Plankton:, Back for more of my delicious Chum, I see!
,Nat:, Not this time!
,Plankton and Mr. Krabs:, Huh?
,Nat:, ,[to Karen], Not ever again! ,[throws all the money at Karen's computer screen], The deal's off, computer! I can't eat another bite of that slop, no matter how much you pay me!
,Plankton:, Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?
,Nat:, I have eaten ten of those things, and I've all ready had to go to the doctor, twice! ,[groans in pain and stumbles backwards, falling to the ground, then two men put him on a medical bed], If you need me, I'll be getting my stomach pumped, again. ,[they carry him out],
,Plankton:, What's the deal, Karen?
,Karen:, The deal was that I paid Nat to eat your Chum, so you'd quit your constant complaining.
,Plankton:, All this time, I never had one regular customer?
,Karen:, Duh.
,Plankton:, Should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?
,Karen:, Uhh, there he goes again. Cut it out, Plankton!
,Plankton:, What? It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure, and a waste of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me! ,[cries],
,SpongeBob:, Quickly, now is the time to be a hasty retreat!
,Mr. Krabs:, What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed me self more! This irony is pretty good stuff. ,[laughs],

"[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Order up! ,[holding a Krabby Patty],
,Squidward:, ,[Takes Krabby Patty to customer] ,Here. ,[Drops Krabby Patty with plate on table],
,Baby/Plankton:, Goo!
,Harold:, ,[Looks up from reading newspaper], Hey, there.
,Baby/Plankton:, ,[makes spitting noise with tongue] ,Num, num! ,[Takes Krabby Patty],
,Harold:, Aw, does baby want a Krabby Patty, hmm?
,Fish #2:, Awww.
,SpongeBob:, (Holding onto Squidward) Baby's first Krabby Patty. ,[sniffles],
,[Baby walking out the door. Security camera looks at baby. Alarms go off and Mr. Krabs is alerted in his office. Mr. Krabs looks through periscope in office.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Seeing Plankton controlling the baby from the inside], That diabolical fiend!
,Plankton:, I can't believe this is working! It's like taking candy from a baby—with a baby.
,Mr. Krabs:, Stop right there, you thievin' infant!
,[Baby stops, turns head around. It makes mechanical squeaks, looks at Mr. Krabs and rotates its head back and continues towards the door. Mr. Krabs dives for the baby, yelling. He body slams the baby. The baby drops the Krabby Patty.],
,SpongeBob:, Yi-eeh! That's harsh.
,Mr. Krabs:, So you thought you could pull a fast one, eh? ,[Holding baby up by the diaper] ,Now, come out of there, you little pest! ,[Spanking the baby and grunting],
,Fish #3:, ,[Gasps] ,What's he doing? You leave that poor baby alone! ,[Pointing at Mr. Krabs and the baby],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay. I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way. ,[Holds up claw],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, no! Don't do it! ,[Holding up his hand to stop],
,[Mr. Krabs grunts and rips the baby in half. The head lands on the ground.],
,Harold:, ,[Covering his mouth], Ooh! Oh... ,[Faints],
,Fish #3:, Oh! ,[faints],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, calm down! It's just Plankton. ,[Squeezes the baby's body and Plankton pops out], See?
,Plankton:, Uh...goo-goo?
,Fish #1:, How dare you! You toyed with our emotions! ,[Pointing at Plankton. Pokes him in the eye],
,Plankton:, Ow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Face it, Plankton. You're never gonna win. I'll always be one step...ahead. ,[Hold up the baby head and puts it back on the body. Chuckles. Takes the baby outside with Plankton in it.], Now, why don't you go back to where you came from, you little brat. ,[Kicks the baby out],
,[3 fish who were standing outside gasp],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-oh.
,Three Fish:, You monster! How dare you! ,[the three fish yell at Mr. Krabs and beat him up with an umbrella, a purse, and a walker],
,[Baby lands at the Chum Bucket and start to cry],
,Karen:, Aww, diddums fail to get a Krabby Patty again? ,[Picks up the baby and brings it inside],
,Plankton:, ,[still in baby costume], Stop patronizing me! Why does every single plan fall apart? It's just a stupid sandwich! I tell you, it's wearing me down!
,Karen:, You need to stop obsessing over it. ,[Lays baby down and changes his diaper], Relax. Get a hobby or something. ,[Tosses dirty diaper with Plankton in it in the diaper bin],
,Plankton:, I hate to admit it, computer wife, but you're probably right. I need something to take my mind off that blasted secret formula for a while. ,[Walks out of garbage bin from a door at the bottom of the can. Walks over to window.], But what?
,Karen:, I know. How about taking care of an inferior life-form?
,Plankton:, You mean a pet? That's a great idea! But how will I find a pet that fits my dynamic personality?
,SpongeBob:, Plankton! ,[Looking through window. Plankton screams], I have the perfect solution to your problem.
,Plankton:, SpongeBob? How could you possibly help me?
,SpongeBob:, You should try the local animal shelter? That's where I found my Gary.
,Plankton:, Oh, yeah? Perhaps you're on to something there.
,[Scene cuts to animal shelter],
,SpongeBob:, Here it is. The Bikini Bottom Animal Shelter. ,[pets barking], Your perfect pet awaits. Now, if you just listen to your heart, you'll be able to pick out the right pet as soon as you see it. ,[Barking continues],
,Plankton:, Hmm. Too big. ,[Walking by worms and snails], Too sloppy.
,Patrick:, Duh... ,[Sitting in cage],
,Plankton:, Too stupid.
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Oh! What about this one?

,SpongeBob:, Oh, no! Plankton!
,Plankton:, You know, I can't say I'm surprised.

,SpongeBob:, Oh, so cute! Whatcha gonna call him? He looks like a ""Spot"" to me.
,[Pet chomps SpongeBob's finger and growls],
,Plankton:, That name provokes a violent reaction. Spot it is! ,[Spot licks Plankton, barks and pants. Back at the Chum Bucket now.], Well, Spot, I'm your new owner, so shower me with love and affection. Karen, it's not giving me unconditional love. I think it's defective.
,Karen:, You're gonna have to train him to do that.
,Plankton:, I train him? ,[sighs], I'll give it a shot. All right, Spot. Let's start with something easy. Stay. ,[Picks up Spot and sits him down], Good boy. Now sit. ,[Squishing noise of Spot sitting], Very good! Now roll over. (Spot barks) Excellent! Now shake. ,[Spot shakes his body, shaking the whole building] ,Wow! That's one mean shake you got there. I think we should burn off some of that extra energy. Would you like to go walkies? ,[Holding up leash], I'll assume that's a yes. ,[Put collar on Spot], March! ,[Spot barks. Plankton whistles. Plankton starts getting tired and panting], Phew. We must've walked for miles. ,[Notices he's only made it to the mailbox], I guess our legs are too short for walkies. How about a nice round of fetch? ,[Brings back tennis ball. Grunts], Fetch! ,[Ball lands on top of Spot and squishes him. Plankton screams.], Oh no. What have I done? I'm a terrible pet owner! Terrible! Karen! We're gonna need another Spot! ,[Spots squishes himself back together and pops up from the ground barking.], Nice rebound, Spot! You know, I get squished a lot too. ,[sniffles. Spot licks Plankton], I hope nobody saw that emotional outburst.
,[Group of 3 fish standing by Plankton],
,All:, Aww!
,Plankton:, Shoo!
,[Three fish walk away],
,Plankton:, ,[Back inside the Chum Bucket], Okay, Spot. Today, you'll learn how to be an attack pet to guard the Chum Bucket from intruders. Now, Spot, pretend I'm a burglar., [Plankton wearing animal costume] ,Attack! ,[Spot whimpers], You're not getting this? Come at me! Uh-oh, losing balance. ,[Falls over], A little help? ,[Spot jumps on Plankton and licks him], On second thought, what do I need a guard dog for? I can't even give chum away. What I really need is a retriever. ,[Plankton now showing Spot a picture of a Krabby Patty], This is your target. I want you to retrieve the Krabby Patty. Now, security is tight, so I've devised a pl-- ,[Spot walks away. Plankton flips to next page of plan with a picture of the Krusty Krab on it], Wait! Where are you going? You're not ready!
,[Spot is sniffing. Opens Chum Bucket door and leaves. Pops through Krusty Krab front door. Sniffing. Walks by Squidward at register. SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen humming cheerfully. Spot goes into the kitchen.],
,Fish #1:, I'd like a large... ,[sees moving Krabby Patty on the ground], What was that?
,Squidward:, Didn't see it, don't care.
,Plankton:, ,[Snoring and drooling. Spot drops Krabby Patty and barks] ,Holy plot twist! It's a Krabby Patty! It's...a miracle! ,[heavenly choir vocals], Karen, look at what Spot brought home.
,Karen:, That's wonderful! Spot deserves a reward.
,Plankton:, He can have anything he wants, up to half my kingdom—uh, laboratory.
,Karen:, I think he wants your Krabby Patty. ,[Spot panting. Chomps entire Krabby Patty],
,Plankton:, Noo! No! You've been a very bad amoeba! Bad amoeba! I'm afraid you'll have to be punished! You need a time out. I'm just gonna tie you up out here until you learn to behave! [,Ties Spot to mailbox], Shouldn't take more than five minutes. ,[Spot whimpers], Aww... no, no, I must be strong! ,[Spot whimpers. Plankton goes back into the Chum Bucket], I can't do it! ,[tender music plays], Spot, I'm sorry! I-- ,[Music stops when Plankton opens the door. Spot is gone and collar is on the ground], Spot! He's gone! ,[Crying], Where is he? Spot! Come back! ,[Sobbing], Spot! Come back! Spot! Come back! I've got to find him!

,All:, Aww.
,Plankton:, Don't any of you have jobs? ,[Plankton goes searching], Spot! Where are you, Spot! (sobbing at the Krusty Krab dumpster)
,SpongeBob:, ,[Walks out back with trash], Why, Plankton, what's wrong? ,[dumps trash],
,Plankton:, I lost Spot.
,SpongeBob:, That's terrible! Gary lost me once. I was cold, alone, starving. It was the worst eight minutes of my life. Come on, Plankton, let's find your pet.
,[Picks up Plankton and tucks him under his arm],
,[Plankton now looking out from being tucked in SpongeBob's pants. Downtown],
,SpongeBob:, Lost pet! Anyone seen this lost pet? ,[Holding up sign that reads ""Have you seen this amoeba?"" with a green speck on it], Lost pet emergency! Be on the lookout for a lost pet! Pardon me, sir. ,[Stops man in suit], Have you seen this amoeba?
,Fish #2:, You mean that little speck?
,SpongeBob:, No. That little speck. ,[Points to sign],
,Fish #2:, Is this him? ,[Holds up shoe],
,Plankton:, No, that's a piece of gum.
,Fish #2:, Gum? ,[Pulls gum off], I've been looking everywhere for this. ,[Puts it in mouth], If I was lookin' for a lost pet, I'd try the animal shelter.
,Plankton:, Of course!
,SpongeBob and Plankton:, The shelter!
,SpongeBob:, I think it's closed for the night. (SpongeBob opens the door. Door clanks) Ooh, it's dark in here. I'll find a light switch. Aha! [,flips switch. Metal clanks heard.] ,Nope, that's not it. ,[Flips another switch], Aha! Found the lights.
,Plankton:, Uh, SpongeBob? What was the first switch for?
,SpongeBob:, I dunno. I think it unlocks the pens?
,Plankton:, I thought so. Because now the animals are loose! ,[animals shriek] ,SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Run for it?
,Plankton:, Yep.
,[SpongeBob picks up Plankton and runs. Panting. Animals shrieking],
,SpongeBob:, I think we lost 'em.
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, before we're torn to shreds, I'd like to thank you for helping me look for Spot.
,SpongeBob:, Aw, it was nothing. Hey, speaking of Spots. Did yo always have a double pupil?
,Plankton:, A double what? ,[Pulls Spot off eye] ,Spot! ,[dramatic music] ,Thank entropy you're safe! You were hiding on my optical cornea the whole time! You sneaky little amoeba, you. ,[Spot barks and licks Plankton. Plankton laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Aw, I'm glad you found Spot. ,[Animals shrieking], Unfortunately, the animals found us too.
,Plankton:, Good-bye, Spot. I guess this is the end of the road for us. ,[Spot growls, barks, and jumps out of Plankton's arms.], Spot, no! ,[Spot barks at other animals. Animals laugh. Spot snarls and grows to a much larger size. Spot barks loudly at animals. The animals all run away back into their cages. The cages close. Spot growls and shrinks back to small size.

,SpongeBob:, Yup, and just relax.
,Sandy:, Yeah. Relax.
,SpongeBob:, Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
,Sandy:, What?
,SpongeBob:, A flower.
,Sandy:, They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.
,SpongeBob:, They sure do.
,Sandy:, You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.
,SpongeBob:, Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
,Sandy:, Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob and Sandy:, ,[both laugh], Me.
,SpongeBob:, That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
,Sandy:, Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See? ,[points to her acorn patch],
,SpongeBob:, I thought that meant you were nuts.
,Sandy:, Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength! ,[his fingers flex], What do you say to that, ""Miss Mittens""?

,SpongeBob:, Proves what?
,Sandy:, That land critters are better than sea critters!

,Sandy Cheeks:, Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!
,Squidward:, ,[walks to the three], What's she blabbering about?
,Patrick:, She says land creatures are best.
,Sandy:, Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur stylin' and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking ,[Mr. Krabs joins the four], and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!
,[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs all gasp],
,Sandy:, And name calling, for sure!
,Squidward:, And drowning, don't forget drowning!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughing], Good one, Squidward! ,[jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair], Woo!
,Squidward:, Not on your life, sport. ,[SpongeBob falls],
,SpongeBob:, I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. ,[SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop], But you're still just a land creature.
,Sandy:, Squirrels can do anything they want to!
,Patrick:, I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. ,[gulps a big patty down], Ah.
,Sandy:, ,[reaches offscreen for the same big patty], Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing. ,[tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy, begins to laugh],
,Patrick:, Thank you, thank you.
,Sandy:, Well, there's just one thing.
,Mr. Krabs:, Can you do this? ,[pops his eyestalks in and out of his head], Everyone in my family can do that.
,Sandy:, ,[Tries to do it], Uh...uh...
,Squidward:, How about this? ,[balances six spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles], Huh?
,SpongeBob:, Can you reproduce by budding. ,[begins to do it], Can ya? Can ya? Huh? Can ya?
,Sandy:, No!
,SpongeBob:, Most importantly...can you do this? ,[all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath],
,Sandy:, Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?
,SpongeBob:, Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here! ,[everyone but Sandy starts laughing],
,Sandy:, Well, you know... ,[all continue laughing], I don't need to... ,[all laughing harder], Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit! ,[rips off suit, and all gasp], And I don't need this helmet neither! ,[throws helmet to ground, releasing an air bubble],
,Mr. Krabs:, Neptune preserve her!
,Squidward:, How long can she stay like that?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know!
,Patrick:, Sandy's a girl?
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... ,[he, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs chuckle while Sandy winks], Yep, won't be long now. ,[she starts struggling to hold her breath], Feelin' light-headed yet?
,Sandy:, Mm-mm. ,[Sandy shakes her head],
,SpongeBob:, Remember this? ,[SpongeBob takes a deep breath in and out],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's free! ,[also takes a deep breath in and out],
,Sandy:, ,[Starts suffocating underwater. Screen shows her insides where her lungs shrivel and her left lung breaks and falls off. She suffocates, looks around, runs to the counter, and quickly digs through multiple objects, then puts her head into a pickle jar and breathes heavily. All the others start laughing], Stop laughing at me!
,Mr. Krabs:, I knew it! There was no way some ""airhead"" was gonna win anything against a water breather!
,Patrick:, Airhead... ,[laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon], Huh? ,[puts thumb in mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top],
,SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs:, Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!
,Sandy:, All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!
,Squidward:, Do we have to wear pickle jars? ,[All, except Sandy, laugh],
,Sandy:, Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.
,SpongeBob:, One minute? No problem, Landy! ,[All but Sandy begin to laugh],
,Sandy:, ,[all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing], Well? So are you going or not?
,SpongeBob:, Actually, you know, but...
,Squidward:, We can't, uh...because...
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, um... we're late for our...
,Patrick:, Our fitting!
,Sandy:, Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!
,Patrick:, ,[holding and eating popcorn], Hey! We are not chicken! ,[drops popcorn], Huh! My popcorn! ,[begins pecking at it like a chicken],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. ,[looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water], There. Mission accomplished.
,Sandy:, Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!
,SpongeBob:, No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!
,Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, Where not afraid of your dumb old land!
,Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, We're sea creatures!
,SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, Okay... Well, this is it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait, boy! ,[gives him a glass of water], Make it last.
,SpongeBob:, ,[drinks from it], Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay! Here I go! ,[gasps out of water, He's now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick], Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!
,Patrick:, I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! ,[jumps up out of the water. He's now a real pink starfish, missing his pants, on a stick], Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here!
,Mr. Krabs:, All ashore, that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho! ,[runs up. he is a red rubber toy crab on a stick],
,SpongeBob:, Looking good, Mr. Krabs!
,Patrick:, Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward!
,SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs:, ,[chanting], Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
,Squidward:, Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it. ,[walks up. he's a puppet octopus with his eyes and big nose. [all stop chanting], ...What?
,SpongeBob:, Well, here we are. ,[all four are walking on the island],
,Squidward,: This is pretty easy.
,Patrick:, I may keep a second rock up here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!
,SpongeBob:, We're the masters of land and sea! ,[a string puppet seagull lands in front of them], Hey, it’s a local. Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? ,[seagull looks at screen],
,Sandy:, 3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better congratulate them. ,[walks onto the island. She's now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head], SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? ,[sees the seagulls attacking all four of them], Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah! ,[attacks the birds and feathers start flying. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down.],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.
,Sandy:, You know, everyone's best at something.
,SpongeBob:, But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.
,Sandy:, Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
,All:, Hooray!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hip hip!
,All:, Hooray!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hip hip!
,Seagulls:, ,[lying injured on the island with their feathers missing], Hooray.

"SpongeBob:, The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.
,Mr. Krabs:, Good job, laddy, another fruitful day pushing patties.
,SpongeBob:, Push-a-what?
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, turning patties into lettuce. ,[Bites a pickle],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, I'm not following you.
,Mr. Krabs:, Cabbage, green backs, money!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you mean your obsession.
,Mr. Krabs:, Obsession is kind of a strong word. ,[opens the safe and puts the money to bed], Sleep tight, me little angels. ,[closes the safe and leaves with SpongeBob and turns out the light],
,[Plankton climbs out of the pickle jar and opens a fake pickle, which contains a plunger launching device. He assembles it and shoots it at the wall above the safe, then climbs the rope, lowers himself onto the combination spinner and spins it by running on the top of the dial],
,Plankton:, 35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left. Open, says me! ,[pulls, but nothing happens], Hey, what gives? I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Comes in], What's going on in here? Hmm, Everything seems to be in order. The safe is still safe. Huh, I must be hearing things. Hey, how'd that pickle end up on the floor? ,[picks Plankton up], Now, what was that rule about dropped food? Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or... ah, well. Waste not, whnt not.
,Narrator:, Approximately 10 hours later
,[In the Chum Bucket],
,Karen:, Plankton, where have you been?!
,Plankton:, Trust me, you do not want to know.
,Karen:, Did you get the Krabby Patty formula? Like I have to ask.
,Plankton:, No, and I probably never will.
,Karen:, You need a more positive outlook!
,Plankton:, Oh, Karen, if only you could just see things way I do. ,[Remembers when a fish, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Patrick squished him by stepping on him],
,Karen:, ,[Gasps], Plankton!
,Plankton:, What?
,Karen:, I think you hit it! You couldn't see the correct combination because you have only one eye. You lack depth perception.
,Plankton:, Maybe you're right. That would explain why I stink at darts.
,Karen:, What you need is a second eye.
,Plankton:, Karen, my dear, I think you're on to something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!
,[Plankton presses a button. A machine covers him then retracts. An eye appears on the side of Plankton's head.],
,Plankton:, ,[eye appears], Success! ,[another eye grows], Uh oh, that ain't good. ,[even more eyes grows], No, no, no, no no no nо nо nо no! I can see every- ,[an eye grows inside of him and pops out of his mouth],
,[Cut to Plankton screwing a brace onto his head],
,Plankton:, Binocular vision, here I come!  ,[presses the button again and an eye grows in the correct place this time. It grows legs], What? Oh mamma! Stop, I command you! ,[it begins to walk, firing a laser beam], Oh, come on, please stop! ,[Karen stops it], Next.
,[Cut to Plankton hobbling about, injured],
,Plankton:, Karen, what am I doing wrong?
,Karen:, Your experiments are missing essential one ingredient.
,Plankton:, It's not love, is it? ‘Cause you know I hate that stuff.
,Karen:, No, it's cells from another eye. Even a single teardrop would contain enough DNA.
,Plankton:, Tears, huh? I guess if I have to. ,[Stabs his foot with a crutch and cries], Ow! Will these do?
,Karen:, No, silly. They have to be from somebody who already has two eyes.
,Plankton:, Two eyes, huh? I think I know a crybaby who fits that description!
,[Cut to SpongeBob setting up a picnic],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Plankton!
,Plankton:, ,[jumps onto lunchbox], Hey, SpongeBob, want to hear a sad story?
,SpongeBob:, No, not particularly.
,Plankton:, Once upon a time, there was a yellow doofus who loved to drink milk with his lunch. But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilt.,[Knocks the milk over],The end.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Starts to cry], S-s-s-sad story! And so timely! ,[SpongeBob cries uncontrollably, Plankton catches his tears in a bag],
,Plankton:, Get a grip!
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk! ,[Opens his face like a refrigerator and pulls out another carton of milk],
,[bubble transition to Plankton tied to a table in his lab],
,Karen:, Are you sure you want to go through with this?
,Plankton:, Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with! ,[a needle lowers, fills with the tear sample then hovers above Plankton's eye], Mommy! Here comes the pain! ,[the needle drops some of the liquid onto Plankton's eye, then retracts], That wasn't so bad. Uh-oh, here we go. ,[his eye splits in two], Eureka!
,Karen:, So, does it work?
,Plankton:, You tell me. ,[Throws a dart and hits bullseye], Bullseye! Now for my next target – the Krabby Patty secret formula! ,[Leaves The Chum Bucket], Hahahaha! ,[skids to a halt], Wha-? ,[everything is bouncing and has a smiley face], Why does everything look so weir- ... look so beautiful!
,SpongeBob:, La la la la!
,Plankton:, Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?
,Plankton:, I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day! ,[he skips away],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, buh-bye!
,[Plankton walks back into the Chum Bucket with an ice cream and a balloon],
,Plankton:, Honey, I'm home!
,Karen:, Oh, you're a happy camper. Did you finally steal the formula?
,Plankton:, Formula, what formula? ,[Drops ice cream], I forgot the formula! I can't imagine what got into me.
,Karen:, It's that new eye of yours. Your evil DNA has become corrupted by SpongeBob's nice DNA. You've gone from evil.. To neevil! You're becoming as harmless as that fry cook.
,Plankton:, Nonsense, You're imagining things.
,Karen:, Oh, really? Let's test it, shall we? Tell me what you see in these ink blots. ,[Holds one up that looks like a bat],
,Plankton:, Hmm. Looks like a pretty butterfly!
,Karen:, Nope. Try again. What does this remind you of? ,[Picture of snake],
,Plankton:, Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!
,Karen:, Try this! ,[Picture of nuclear explosion],
,Plankton:, Uhh...
,Karen:, I'll give you a hint. ,[Makes explosion sound],
,Plankton:, A bouquet of flowers! Would you like some flowers, honey?
,Karen:, Cells from that sponge have changed your whole point of view.
,Plankton:, Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing. I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula. ,[Runs outside],
,[A building is on fire and citizens are screaming; Bubble Bass is trapped on the top floor, waving his arms],
,Plankton:, Such lovely destruction!
,Bubble Bass:, Help! Save me! ,[sips soda], Save me!
,Plankton:, I'll help you! Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!
,Bubble Bass:, Comin' down.
,Plankton:, Oh no. ,[Bubble Bass sits on him, squashing Plankton.],
,Bubble Bass:, Thanks, buddy!
,Plankton:, Unbelievable! I've committed another selfless act. This eye is taking over! But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping the Krabby Patty formula. ,[A bottle rolls toward him], What's this? It's the Krabby Patty formula! Uh-wha.. Krabs must have lost it!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Standing at a bus stop with SpongeBob], And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs! ,[Salutes],
,Plankton:, Hey, Eugene! You missing anything? ,[Holds out the formula],
,Mr. Krabs:, Me Krabby Patty Formula!
,Plankton:, That's right, Krabs. Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground! ,[Laughs], So I'm giving it back to you, take it.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! Something smells and it isn't my long johns. ,[Takes formula back], Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?
,Plankton:, Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!
,Mr. Krabs:, Since when do you care about stealing?
,Plankton:, Oh, it's this cursed new eye! I've got to get rid of it! Must become monocular again. ,[Tries to squeeze his eyes together], Hahaha, I did it! ,[They separate again. He tries to pull the eye off of his face, but he falls over.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-huh. ,[Walks away],
,[Plankton returns to the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, My life of evil is over. ,[Tries to fix eyes], Hey, why is it so dark in here?
,[Lights turn on to reveal a surprise party],
,Everybody:, Surprise!
,Plankton:, ,[Screams],The Chum Bucket's been invaded. I'll never surrender, never!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Laughs], This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately. We came to give a great big hug!
,Plankton:, What, no! Not hugs! ,[Plankton screams and they hug him and the new eye pops out and Plankton looks in a mirror], It's gone. That disgustingly good eye is finally gone! I'm cured! Thank you, thank you all! Especially you, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, glad I could help.
,Plankton:, Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation, I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security attack lasers! ,[Presses a button and lasers start shooting. Everybody screams in terror and run away. Plankton laughs.], Oh, well. Depth perception's overrated anyway. ,[Turns to enter the lab, but walks into the door and falls over],

"[View of the Krusty Krab],
,Squidward:, ,[from inside], One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day. ,[cut to inside of the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. ,[flips it up in the air and it falls into one of his holes. He holds up the other ingredients],
,Squidward:, Come on, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Next, les ingredients. ,[throws them in the air], Ah, oui! ,[he catches them in his holes and his pants], Les mustard. ,[he squirts some mustard out and it lands in his eye],
,Squidward:, Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
,SpongeBob:, Les hold on a second! ,[SpongeBob takes his head and shakes it all up. When he puts it back on his body, his eyes roll around], And voila! ,[He goes up to Squidward and pulls a Krabby Patty from under his nose], It's under your nose! ,[Laughs and puts it on a plate. Squidward pretends to laugh],
,Squidward:, You're killing me, SpongeBob! Ha ha ha...you really are. ,[Close-up on the patty],.
,SpongeBob:, Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
,Squidward:, Okay, give it to me. ,[The Krabby Patty flies off of the plate and starts bouncing all over the place], Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
,SpongeBob:, ,[the patty slithers out the door and heads for the exit], I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! ,[The patty gallops along until Mr. Krabs spears it with his leg. A tiny thing comes out from it and Krabs inspects it with a magnifying glass.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is... ,[view of in the magnifying glass, of a tiny jelly bean-shaped green creature with one eye], Plankton! Stealing me booty!
,Sheldon J. Plankton:, Hear me, Krabs. When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business. I went to college! ,[Krabs picks up the puny pest], Hey! Let me go!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer! ,[laughs. He splats Plankton on a plate and spins him back across the street, to the Chum Bucket], Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
,Plankton:, You'll pay for this, Krabs! ,[slams through the doors],
,SpongeBob:, Uh..Plankton, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug? ,[laughs.. SpongeBob joins in, braying with laughter. Krabs stops, but SpongeBob keeps laughing], Okay. ,[keeps laughing], Enough, lad, it wasn't that funny. ,[keeps laughing], Get back to work! ,[SpongeBob stops. Cut to nighttime at the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, ,[from inside], Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
,Mr. Krabs:, Good night, me boy! ,[SpongeBob walks out and walks past the Chum Bucket contently],
,Plankton:, ,[unseen], Psst...young man. ,[SpongeBob looks around to see where this voice came from], Yes, over here. Come on, boy, a little closer. ,[SpongeBob walks forward], Closer... ,[SpongeBob walks], Not that close! ,[a crunching sound is heard. SpongeBob lifts up his shoe revealing a squished Plankton], You blasted barnacle head! I mean...hi. ,[SpongeBob peels Plankton off his shoe and onto his hand],
,SpongeBob:, Plankton? What do you want?
,Plankton:, I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
,SpongeBob:, Um...no.
,Plankton:, Acquaintances?
,SpongeBob:, No.
,Plankton:, Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
,SpongeBob:, I...guess so.
,Plankton:, You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment. ,[rummages through his back pocket and takes out a golden spatula], Ching! ,[in unison with the sparkling of the spatula], Sparkle, sparkle.
,SpongeBob:, Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.
,Plankton:, It's a gift! A gift from a friend. ,[hugs SpongeBob's thumb], Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday. ,[puts a birthday hat on his head and SpongeBob's thumb and then blows a noisemaker. He then takes out a cake], And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? ,[blows out the candles],.
,SpongeBob:, A booster seat? ,[Plankton takes off the hat and throws out the cake],
,Plankton:, Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those ,[starts to drool], tender...delicious...Krabby Patties! ,[SpongeBob drops Plankton and screams],
,SpongeBob:, You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow.
,Plankton:, Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
,SpongeBob:, You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me! ,[walks off, then stops], Even if we are friends! ,[runs off], Never, never, never, never!
,Plankton:, Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! ,[takes out a gramophone that plays evil music and laughs evilly to it. Cut to SpongeBob's bedroom, where SpongeBob goes to sleep],
,SpongeBob:, Good night, Gary. ,[Gary meows. SpongeBob goes to sleep. Just then, one of the flowers on SpongeBob's bed pattern pops up. It's Plankton in disguise, wearing a backpack that looks more like an antenna-like machine.],
,Plankton:, ,[chuckling], SpongeBob, you will be mine! ,[pulls out the record player and laughs evilly to it, but it actually plays a children's song of the A-B-C's.],
,Woman in the recording:, ♪Letters of the alphabet, A-B-C...♪
,[Plankton realizes this and flips the record around. It plays the evil music like last time and he laughs. Then he walks through one of SpongeBob's holes and begins his journey. Plankton reads a map that looks like a regular road map, except with a giant brain in the middle of it.],
,Plankton:, It should be in here...but where? ,[pan out to reveal he's standing on the brain], Where? Oh... ,[takes off the antenna thing on his back], This will be the beginning of the end! ,[outside, SpongeBob rolls to his left in his sleep. The brain falls to the right inside and Plankton falls off], Ouch! Stupid brain... ,[gives chase], Come back here, you swine! ,[SpongeBob then rolls to his right. Inside, the brain squishes Plankton. SpongeBob then sleeps on his back and the brain stops rolling. Plankton holds up a roll of duct tape], That's it, brain, you're going down! ,[Plankton uses tape to hold it down], Yes, yes, that's grand. ,[takes out blueprints], And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan. ,[the blueprints reveal a picture of the antenna thing labeled ""Control"" and an arrow pointing to a picture of a brain labeled ""Brain."" Plankton follows these instructions by jamming the control in the brain], And now, it's time for a little wakey-uppy. ,[his hands on the control levers, he uses his foot to press the ""Total Control"" button. Outside, SpongeBob wakes up],
,SpongeBob:, Morning already? ,[Plankton jams the controls causing SpongeBob's legs to jam out to his side. He rumbles and falls down. Plankton laughs evilly], I... I feel a little funny today. ,[using the controls, he makes SpongeBob walk. Plankton laughs],
,Plankton:, I have you now! ,[outside, SpongeBob keeps walking towards the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Time for a well-balanced breakfast. ,[he rams through the wall and through his refrigerator, emerging with bread, a bottle of milk, and an egg carton on his head], This isn't what I had in mind. ,[he walks towards the straps with his pants attached], Let me just grab my pants. ,[he walks toward them and they spring him. He eventually gives free and keeps walking], I guess I'm not wearing any pants today. ,[he crashes through the side of the wall], I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess. ,[Gary meows], You're right, Gary! There ,is, something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! ,[inside Squidward's house, he tries to sleep. Off-screen], Squidward! Help!
,Squidward:, Be quiet, SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob bursts through the wall of Squidward's bedroom],
,SpongeBob:, Help!
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad? ,[SpongeBob crashes through the opposite wall. He stops walking and his head turns around 180 degrees],
,Plankton:, ,[through SpongeBob], Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
,Squidward:, Mediocre? ,[from inside, Plankton speaks through a microphone],
,Plankton:, You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste! ,[SpongeBob snaps out of it],
,SpongeBob:, Something must be wrong with my brain! ,[SpongeBob's eyes roll into the back of his head and he sees Plankton. Gasps], Plankton! ,[Plankton raises his eyebrow], What kind of friend are you?
,Plankton:, Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! ,[from outside],
,SpongeBob:, Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone! ,[in Plankton's voice], Never! Never! ,[laughs and walks out backward. Squidward faints. SpongeBob crashes through Patrick's rock and reemerges with Patrick on his head. SpongeBob throws him off and he's pinned into the ground. SpongeBob walks toward the Krusty Krab.],
,Plankton:, ,[inside SpongeBob], Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
,SpongeBob:, No! No, never! ,[he crashes through it, reemerging with a Krabby Patty. Plankton laughs evilly], You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty formula! ,[SpongeBob walks into the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
,SpongeBob:, No, no, no! ,[they're inside and walk through a door], There's no one here.
,Plankton:, Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab! ,[the room he's walked into has a screen with a live-action Labrador retriever. He barks a couple of times. They walk into the next room, a real lab], And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? ,[He pulls it out again and it plays dramatic music. Plankton laughs],
,SpongeBob:, I must fight! ,[He mumbles nonsensically, stretches his head out, and bites against the side of the door. His body keeps trying to walk.],
,Plankton:, No, no, no, no. ,[He pushes the levers forward, which causes SpongeBob to lose grip and slam against the wall and wobble over to a giant funnel thing], There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. ,[A robot arm clenching some seaweed comes in and drops it in the giant funnel analyzer. It has zapped and some beeping is heard from the giant computer screen. The screen, then reads what the computer says.],
,Karen Plankton:, Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed. ,[a picture of the seaweed appears],
,Plankton:, Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula. ,[laughs. pulls the lever forward, letting two of SpongeBob's fingers off the patty. He's holding it with both hands, so one finger from each hand], And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty. ,[two more fingers loose grip], This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants? ,[SpongeBob tries to resist, but stops],
,SpongeBob:, I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down. ,[His eyes fill up with tears and leak down his cheeks], I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, ,[One of his teary eyes twinkle], you delicate little Krabby Patty.
,Plankton:, Mmm...
,SpongeBob:, ,[tearing up even more], With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. ,[inside, Plankton starts to get hungry],
,Plankton:, Steamy... ,[a live-action patty gets assembled on screen as SpongeBob states the ingredients],
,SpongeBob:, I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. ,[inside, Plankton starts to drool excessively],
,Plankton:, Yes... yes... yes! ,[he jumps out of one of SpongeBob's holes to the patty], Come to papa! ,[he bounces off the patty and lands in the analyzer], Oh, boy... ,[he is zapped and the computer reads out the analysis],
,Karen:, Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas. ,[Plankton appears on the screen],
,Plankton:, Well, this stinks.
,SpongeBob:, Well, patty, I guess we can go home now. ,[walks out],
,Plankton:, SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty! ,[SpongeBob walks out the swivel doors and they go back and forth], Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty! ,[the doors come to a close], Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.

"TV Announcer:, We interrupt this program to bring you a Bikini Bottom News Flash!
,[Robotic seahorse races out of the Chum Bucket, controlled by Plankton. Robotic horse neighs.],
,Plankton:, Whoa, big fella!
,Perch Perkins:, Mr. Plankton, we've received a word that you're plotting to infiltrate the Krusty Krab and steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. ,[shoves Plankton a microphone to speak to], Is that true?
,Plankton:, ,[thinks for a while], Actually, yes, that is true. I've got it all worked out. ,[shows point-of-view of the cameraman], First I break into the safe, and... ,[looks back], Huh? Wait, is this live?
,Perch Perkins:, Yes!
,[Cameraman moves closer to Plankton. Plankton gets angry and uses a lever to eject a springing punchfist.],
,Plankton:, Don't broadcast my secret plans! They're secret! ,[cameraman appears again. Plankton slams his head onto the camera screen.], I will destroy all of you! ,[cameraman's camera cuts],
,[Plankton respires very quickly. He then wears a cowboy hat.],
,Plankton:, Secret formula, ho! ,[whips Robot Seahorse and it races to the Krusty Krab.],
,[Arrives at the Krusty Krab. Plankton ties it to the Krusty Krab sign to park his Robot Seahorse.],
,Plankton:, ,[Texas accent], I reckon that classified taste mixture will be in my hands directly. ,[spits into a golden pot],
,[Plankton walks to the Krusty Krab. Robot Seahorse sneezes a metal nut, which happens to crush Plankton, landing into the gold pot. Plankton gets up, shown with a squashed, hexagon-shaped head.],
,Plankton:, ,[spits], Ow! ,[shakes his head quickly. Stares through the Krusty Krab door to see Mr. Krabs' office with an open vault and exposed Krabby Patty Secret Formula. Laughs evilly], The fool! He left the safe open! ,[presses a button to make his rocket missile appear. It blasts off randomly, but soon moves straight toward the Krusty Krab.],
,Plankton:, Open for business, baby! ,[zooms past the customers in the Krusty Krab, then crashes into a paper drawing of the vault.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[cheeky laugh. Jumps out of his desk, tears off paper], Gotcha! ,[rolls paper into a scroll],
,[Mr. Krabs puts salt on the paper and feeds it to the robot seahorse.],
,Plankton:, Urrgh!
,[Mr. Krabs laughs and goes back inside the restaurant. The scene changes to Plankton watching Mr. Krabs making a delivery with his Krusty Katering truck.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm off to make a delivery. ,[enters the truck and drops one of the patties],
,Plankton:, Ha, that fool!
,[Plankton runs out of the Chum Bucket, picks up the fallen patty, and takes it to his laboratory. Plankton begins analyzing it with his microscope.],
,Plankton:, And the Krabby Patty is made of...
,[Karen removes the bun and hordes of sea urchins come out.],
,Plankton:, Urchins!
,Karen:, Ew! Ew! ,[runs away],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[appears on his analyzer], Gotcha! ,[laughs],
,[The urchins cover up Plankton's lab. The scene changes to Plankton flying to the Krusty Krab with his antennas acting as propellers. He snatches a patty from a customer.],

,Customer:, Huh?
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Yes!
,Mr. Krabs:, Pull!

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Gotcha.
,[The scene changes to Plankton hiding in a barrel seat. He sees a customer going to sit at his table and jumps into his pocket. Plankton jumps into the customers drink and gets slurped into his body.],
,Plankton:, Whee! ,[lands in the customer's stomach], Come to daddy, patty!
,[The customer eats the patty. Plankton catches the patty and laughs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[appears in the customer's stomach as well], Gotcha. ,[laughs],
,[Mr. Krabs takes the patty out of the customer's stomach. Plankton becomes enraged and is fed up with his failures. He stomps on his antennas in frustration. The scene cuts back to the Chum Bucket.],
,Plankton:, Oh, Karen, he covered me in urchins, fed me to a seahorse, and stung me to death! I fly through the air, he flies through the air! I hide in a stomach, he hides in a stomach! I have had enough!
,Karen:, Oh, I think someone needs their ba-ba. ,[feeds Plankton a bottle of milk], There, isn't that better?
,Plankton:, ,[throws bottle away], No, Karen! That's just not gonna work anymore! Don't you see? We're done here.
,Karen:, He said for the 9 billionth time. You know, Sheldon, if I had a dime for every time you... ,[gets unplugged by Plankton],
,[Plankton claps his hands to turn off the lights. He walks out of the Chum Bucket with a phonograph. He plays the record with the song, ""Taps."" He pushes the button on the remote and the Chum Bucket's hand buries the restaurant. The hand waves good-bye to Plankton and disappears. Plankton puts a sign that says, ""Gone Retirin'"" on the shovel and moves out with his suitcase. Mr. Krabs is washing the windows with SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, did you see that? Plankton is retiring.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll believes it when I sees it.

,SpongeBob:, Aye-aye, Mr.—Whoa!
,[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and uses him as a water ski just as the bus drags them away.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw, you want to say good-bye to Plankton, you old softy you.
,Mr. Krabs:, That'll be the day! I don't trust Plankton as far as I throw him! That's why we're gonna shadow that little twit and find out what he's up to!
,French Narrator:, 82 kilometers later...
,[The bus stops near a sign that says, ""Dullsville.""],
,SpongeBob:, ""Welcome to Dullsville, a charmingly boring...""

,[Plankton enters the shoe store. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are disguising as an elderly couple and watches Plankton.],
,SpongeBob:, I still don't see Plankton doing anything wrong. Maybe he really is retiring.
,Mr. Krabs:, Believes it when I sees it.

,Clerk:, Yes?
,Plankton:, I'd like a room, please.

,Plankton:, Forever. ,[An old man's squishes Plankton with his walker and proceeds to smear him on the floor while Plankton yells.],
,[Plankton enters his room with his stuff.],
,Plankton:, And so begins my retirement! ,[laughs manically],
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are clinging on the ceiling fan.],
,Mr. Krabs:, You see there, lad? Plankton is up to no good! I bet those are all the fixings for another evil lab.
,SpongeBob:, ,[his skin turns green], Mr. Krabs, I'm gonna be sick.
,Plankton:, ,[laughs as he unpacks his boxes], Yes! ,[puts on belt], Yes! ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, You see? He's got an evil belt to match those evil shoes!
,[Plankton unpacks another box and breaks a pair of glasses in half. He combs his antenna. He removes his eyebrow and replaces it with tape to look like an old retired man. He looks at himself in the mirror.],
,Plankton:, Yes! My plan is almost complete! ,[laughs manically],
,Mr. Krabs:, His plan! ,[shakes SpongeBob], Did you hear that, SpongeBob? He said, ""plan!""
,SpongeBob:, Uh, please don't shake me, Mr. Krabs.
,[Plankton opens his chair.],
,Plankton:, Oh, my pretty. You'll be my best friend from now on. ,[laughs], Retirement is mine! Mine! Mine! ,[laughs manically],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh, this is it, boy-o. He's got an evil laser death apparatus contraption ready to spring on all of us!
,[Plankton stops laughing. He jumps on the chair, grabs some popcorn and goes to watch television. The ceiling fan cracks.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh.
,[The fan breaks and falls off the ceiling, sending SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs crashing on top of Plankton.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now that I sees it, I believes it.
,SpongeBob:, Hurray! I knew you'd get it, Mr. ,[gets sick], Krabs! ,[runs into the bathroom and throws up],
,Plankton:, Krabs?! What are you doing in my hotel room?!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[stammers], Oh. ,[shakes hands with Plankton], Good luck on your retirement, Plankton. I won't give you any more trouble.
,Plankton:, Oh, I know you won't, Krabs, because I'm at the Krusty Krab right now stealing that formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh-oh, sure. Whatever you say, old-timer. How would you be doing that when you're all the way over here in Dullsville, hmm?
,Plankton:, ,[laughs], Because I'm a decoy look-alike robot!
,[Plankton rips off his skin to reveal that he is a robot.],
,Robot Plankton:, Gotcha! ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob comes back out from the bathroom.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], So what'd I miss?
,Both:, What?!
,[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, the real Plankton is sneaking into Mr. Krabs' office.],
,Plankton:, ,[through walkie-talkie], That's right, Karen. By the time those two knuckleheads figure it out, I'll be knee-deep in secret formula. ,[laughs], Yes, I'll wear my galoshes. Gotta go.
,[Plankton jumps onto the safe, puts some explosive clay on it, and molds it into the shape of Mr. Krabs.],
,Plankton:, In your face, Krabs! Ha!
,[Plankton blows up the safe and grabs the formula. He bumps into Mr. Krabs.],
,Plankton:, Krabs? SpongeBoob? W-w-why aren't you in Dullsville?
,Mr. Krabs:, We never left, Sheldon. The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob who followed the robot you to Dullsville were also robots. Gotcha! ,[laughs],
,Plankton:, ,[grumbles], Hate! Hate! ,[bangs his head against the floor], Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
,[Back at the Dullsville's Senior Living, the robot Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob reveal themselves as robots to the robot Plankton.],
,Robot SpongeBob:, So the way I see it, Mr. Krabs and Plankton are just using us as pawns in their dumb secret formula war.
,Robot Plankton:, Agreed.
,Robot Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, I mean, who cares if that guy steals the secret formula anyway? Grow up, that's what I say.
,Robot Plankton:, Agreed.
,[Cuts back at the Krusty Krab.],
,Plankton:, So you're the real Krabs and SpongeBob. ,[grabs formula], Gimme that! ,[runs off],
,Both:, Ooh. ,[yells],
,[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob chase Plankton around the restaurant. As they chase, they started a brawl, which gets all of the customers and Squidward involved. During the brawl, the phone rings.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[answers the phone], Hello? Krusty Krab, may I take your order? No, Mr. Krabs is unable to come to the phone right now. He's trapped under a dust cloud brawl. Yeah, he'll have to call you back. ,[hangs up the phone], Gee, I hope our robot look-alikes are okay. Bless their heart-like pneumatic pumps.
,[The robot SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton look-alikes are having a fun time together. They chew on nuts and bolts, eat a car engine, play on the playground, play volleyball and soak up in a hottub. They stand on the Dullsville sign.],

"[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing a solider helmet.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, we all know what this day is.
,SpongeBob:, Today is the day when Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, sir! ,[continuously whacks Squidward with the mop while talking],
,Squidward:, Like he does every day. ,[takes the mop from SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, But this time, he's not going to catch me with me spatula down! ,[laughs], Ooh? ,[flips his spatula right side-up], SpongeBob, you're on guard duty, boy!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs! ,[hops in the mop wringer bucket and heads to the front door],
,Squidward:, And I'll go undercover. ,[grabs a pillow and a blanket and goes to sleep as usual],
,[Mr. Krabs glares down at Squidward.],
,SpongeBob:, Hup, two, three, four! Hup, two, three, four! ♪Krabby Patties are the best! They'll put hair on your chest!♪
,[A female customer looks into her dress and hair pops out.],
,Female customer:, ,[gasps], Oh!
,French Narrator:, Three hours later...
,[SpongeBob is very tired from patrolling the front door.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[weakly], ♪Krabby Patties are the best... They'll put hairs...into your nest♪ ,[flops down to the floor],
,[Squidward wakes up from his ""undercover"" and gets whacked with the mop.],
,Squidward:, Ow.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[picks SpongeBob up], Any sign of Plankton?
,SpongeBob:, Uh, afraid not, Mr. Krabs.
,Squidward:, Maybe he's on vacation.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't be silly! We always take our trips together, ,[his eyestalk enlarges at Squidward], to keep an eye on each other. What's taking that crook so long? ,[looks at his watch], Hm... Maybe the door is stuck. ,[oils the hinges on the door and sees a line of customers coming], Ah, for—these customers are blocking the way! ,[flips the road and sends the customers hurling into passing garbage truck; sighs], There we go. Nice, open path. ,[his path is nice and sparkly], Hm? Mm... Hey! Well, maybe he just needs a little incentive. ,[cuts to the Krusty Krab displaying the secret formula on a pillow; the sign blinkers the words ""Secret Formula"" with arrows pointing at it], There we go. ,[peaks over the cash register and looks at his watch; he slowly begins to worry], Maybe he doesn't want me formula anymore. ,[gasps as he sees the formula missing], He took the bait! We're going to red alert! ,[pushes the alarm button and the alarm goes off; the lights in the restaurant blink red and blue; then it covers itself with a protective shield and spins into the ground. Mr. Krabs peaks out of the ground through the telescope], Batten down the hatches! Furl the deck! Stop that greedy green goober!
,[The customers moan and groan from all the spinning. SpongeBob runs around with a pile of bricks. He trips over Nat Peterson and sends the bricks flying to the window. Squidward dodges the bricks.],
,Squidward:, ,[sighs but gets hit in the face with the brick], Ow.
,[SpongeBob bends the kitchen door down, wraps it up and stuffs it in his head.],
,Patrick:, Doggone it! ,[shakes the bottle with the secret formula], Can I get some ketchup over here? Please?
,Mr. Krabs:, False alarm.
,[The restaurant comes back out of the ground. The customers recover from the spinning and quickly run out due to motion sickness.],
,Whistle:, ,[blowing], Closing time!
,[SpongeBob and Squidward remove their hats and prepare to go home. Mr. Krabs jumps in front of them, blocks the door and grabs his employees.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And just where do you think you two are going?
,Squidward:, ,[pulls himself free], It's customary to go home at closing time.
,SpongeBob:, Aren't you going home, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[puts SpongeBob down and laughs], Oh, I'm not budging. Plankton is gonna try something. I don't know when. I don't know where.
,Squidward:, Probably...here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, yeah. But when he does, I'll be waiting for him. ,[cackles and rubs his claws in a greedy motion],
,[SpongeBob and Squidward exit the front door and quietly leave. Mr. Krabs turns off the light.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'll be waiting right here.
,French Narrator:, The next morning...
,SpongeBob:, ,[enters the restaurant], Morning! Hm? ,[takes his hat while Squidward takes his], I guess Mr. Krabs went home after all.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, I'm still here... ,[reveals himself to be camouflaged to the floor], Waiting for that blasted Plankton!
,[SpongeBob and Squidward become startled with Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs gets up. His eyestalks shrink to look like chameleon eyes and rolls away. The scene changes to Squidward trying to take a customer's order.],
,Customer:, Yeah, I'll take—
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[opens the customer's mouth], Me patty formula?! Huh? I knew it! You in there, Plankton?! ,[shakes the bones out of the customer's body],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, that's not Plankton!
,[The customer's whole skeleton falls out of the body. Mr. Krabs drops the customer's body.],
,Customer:, ,[gets up and grabs his body], I will never set foot in this establishment again! ,[whacks Mr. Krabs with his skeleton foot], From now on, I'm using the drive-thru! ,[leaves],
,[Mr. Krabs gasps and sees Mrs. Puff walking out with a Krabby Patty. He fishes Mrs. Puff with the fishing hook.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Aha! Trying to sneak a Krabby Patty to Plankton, eh? ,[takes the patty from Mrs. Puff],
,Mrs. Puff:, But Eugene, it's just a to-go order.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[mocking gibberish], Well, from now on, all patties are to be eaten on the premises! ,[sets Mrs. Puff down],
,Squidward:, What are you gonna do now, ban pockets?
,Mr. Krabs:, Capital idea, Mr. Squidward.
,[Mr. Krabs uses a reef blower to steal money from a customer's pockets. It even sucked up his clothes. Mr. Krabs puts a barrel onto the customer's body.],
,Mr. Krabs:, There'll be a $50-a-barrel surcharge from now on! ,[sucks in more clothes and money with the reef blower and gives them more barrels; An old man is about to leave, but Mr. Krabs stops him], Whoa, hey, slow down there, Grandpa. Let me see here. ,[scans him with the scanner, removes his hat and reveals a stack of patties on his hat], Aha! Another one of Plankton's spies!
,Old man:, I just wanted some for later.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[violently stamps him with a ""BANNED"" stamper], You're banned! ,[kicks him out and sees a baby sucking on a Krabby Patty], Hm... So Plankton's recruiting baby burglars now! ,[removes the patty from the baby's mouth and the baby cries], Put a cork in it! ,[stuffs the baby's mouth with a cork and shoves both the baby and the mother in a barrel that says, ""BANNED""], You're banned! ,[continues to violently stamp the customers with the ""BANNED"" stamper], You! You're banned! You're banned! Banned! ,[one customer's head gets a nasty bump from the stamper], Banned! ,[Tom's teeth say the word, ""BANNED""; Mr. Krabs lifts his restaurant and bashes the customers away; he speaks through the Krusty Krab sign], You're all banned! ,[barricades the door while breathing heavily],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I don't think Plankton's coming.
,Mr. Krabs:, Nonsense! ,[hears a knock at the door and gasps], See? It's that stinker Plankton now! What do you want?
,Sandy:, ,[off-screen], Uh...A Krabby Patty?
,Mr. Krabs:, Why?
,Sandy:, ,[off-screen], I'm hungry.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, that's just Sandy.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[peaks through the hole and sees Sandy waving innocently], I'm not falling for it. ,[sticks his eyestalk through the hole], That's the worst squirrel suit I've ever seen. ,[shakes a spray can and sprays the word ""BANNED"" on Sandy's suit; gibbers as he begins to lose his sanity],
,SpongeBob:, ,[feeling a bit creeped out by Mr. Krabs' behavior; whispers to Squidward], Do you think Mr. Krabs is acting...strange?
,[Mr. Krabs climbs up the ceiling, snaps his claws, and his mouth foams while he gibbers.],
,Squidward:, He seems fine to me.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers], Maybe we should postpone our plans for tonight.
,Mr. Krabs:, Plans?! Aha! You're both working for Plankton! Get out of me restaurant you tricky treacherous traitors! ,[violently stamps them with the ""BANNED"" stamper and sends them flying out of the restaurant],
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab chained and barricade. Mr. Krabs is hiding underneath the register boat while protecting the Krabby Patty formula. It appears that Mr. Krabs has completely lost his mind and is completely losing full sanity of himself.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I know you're in here, Plankton. Where are you hiding?
,Plankton:, ,[off-screen], I'm right here... ,[Mr. Krabs jumps out and sees the television on], at the Chum Bucket! Come on down and try our new Chum Nuggets.
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh. ,[turns off the television], Whew. ,[sees Plankton's shadow and gasps; he hides behind a pole; he looks and sees that is was only a cup with two straws], Oh. ,[chuckles], Just a—just a cup.
,[Mr. Krabs hallucinates when he sees the cup transform into Plankton. Plankton laughs evilly and Mr. Krabs becomes scared. Everywhere he looks, he sees everything transform into various images of Plankton, laughing at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs runs to escape, but no matter how he attempts to escape, all of the images of Plankton keep following him while laughing. Mr. Krabs crawls into a hole, which turns into Plankton's eyeball and reveals a red demonic version of Plankton holding the secret formula while laughing. Back in reality, Mr. Krabs is completely losing himself and screams. He runs to the bathroom and goes to wash his face at the sink.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[washes his face], Get ahold of yourself. Get ahold of yourself. ,[turns off the faucet and sighs], I'm starting to see things. ,[laughs],
,[Mr. Krabs hallucinates as he is seeing his eyestalks transform into Plankton.He screams and gibbers. He runs up the pole with the formula and pops out from the ceiling. Just then, he notices something going on at the Chum Bucket.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[pulls out a telescope and sees SpongeBob and Squidward entering the Chum Bucket], Those two ,are, working for Plankton! ,[gasps as he sees Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Patrick, and Pearl enter the Chum Bucket],
,Pearl:, ,[bumps into the door], Ow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Me own daughter? ,[sheds a tear and sees Old Man Jenkins enter the Chum Bucket too], Oh, not Old Man Jenkins! ,[cries violently and goes back into the restaurant], Everyone really is out to get you. Aren't they, my little formula?
,[Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Mr. Krabs goes up to the door and peaks through the hole. He sees SpongeBob standing out there.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs? You have got to come with me to...,[reads a note], the Chum Bucket for Plankton has kidnapped Squidward.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, so that's Plankton's evil plan? He wants me formula as ransom! What do we do? What? What's that? ,[leans in the bottle closely as if it was talking to him], Oh, that's just brilliant! Hold on a minute. I'll go get the ransom. ,[goes into the kitchen], Oh, you want a Krabby Patty, do you? Well, I'll give you a Krabby Patty. ,[laughs maniacally as he stuffs a variety of dangerous objects into the patties and cooks them on the grill; he makes a whole plateful of Krabby Patties; he goes to grab them, but they spark; Mr. Krabs checks them to see if they'll ignite, but nothing happens; he grabs the plate and laughs evilly; he kicks open the door], Okay, let's go rescue Squidward. ,[laughs],
,[SpongeBob lifts the door up and appears to be flat. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk over to the Chum Bucket. They enter the restaurant and see Squidward tied up to a chair and gagged. Plankton appears on Squidward's head.],
,Plankton:, ,[giggles evilly], Surprised, Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not at all, Sheldon. I knew you were up to something.
,Plankton:, Oh, yeah? How about now? ,[pulls out a remote and pushes the button],
,[The lights turn on and all of Mr. Krabs' friends and family jump out.],
,Everyone:, Surprise!
,[Mr. Krabs screams in surprise. He then becomes confused.],
,Plankton:, Oh, come, Krabs. It's the anniversary of the first time I tried to steal your Krabby Patty formula!
,SpongeBob:, ,[places a cake on top of Plankton], So, we threw you a surprise party.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[teary-eyed], You mean you weren't working for Plankton?!
,SpongeBob:, Of course not, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sheds a tear], Oh, I shouldn't have suspected you, SpongeBob! Whew. Won't need these anymore. ,[laughs],
,[Mr. Krabs sets the plateful of Krabby Patties down and hugs SpongeBob. All of his friends and family members forgive Mr. Krabs for his actions.],
,Patrick:, Oh, boy, Krabby Patties! ,[grabs the plate],
,Sandy:, Yee-haw!
,[Mr. Krabs sees them go to eat the patties and screams. He knows what's gonna happen if they take a bite out of them. So, he rushes over to protect them all. Mrs. Puff goes to eat the patty.],
,Mr. Krabs:, No! Don't eat the patties! ,[snatches the patty from Mrs. Puff], Gotcha. ,[two jellyfish come out from the patty and sting his eyestalks],
,[Mr. Krabs grabs the patty from Patrick. A foothold trap clamps down on his eyestalks. He screams in pain. He grabs the patty from Sandy, Squidward, and Old Man Jenkins.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whew. ,[his destructive patties ignite and squirt tarter sauce on him], Ah, tarter sauce!
,[The patties spin Mr. Krabs around and launch him into the air. The patties explode into a fireworks display, showing images of Mr. Krabs himself. Everyone gazes at the spectacular fireworks display as if Mr. Krabs is putting on a show for them. Mr. Krabs comes back down and crashes onto the floor, completely burned.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[dizzy], Yay. ,[crumbles to ashes],
,[It appears that Mr. Krabs got what he deserved for being a paranoid jerk, banning everyone from the restaurant, causing physical harm, and for letting his insane behavior put his own business in jeopardy. The scene changes to the aftermath of the anniversary party. Everyone exits the Chum Bucket and wave good-bye. But Squidward, on the other hand, is still tied to the chair as he hops along.],
,Squidward:, A little help here!
,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs is now wrapped in bandages and is wearing a cast on his right arm.],
,SpongeBob:, Did you enjoy the surprise party, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, I'll tell you in a second. ,[turns SpongeBob around to see the Chum Bucket],
,[Meanwhile, inside, Plankton chews through the cake and pops out the top.],
,Plankton:, ,[spits some cake out], Huh? ,[sees the formula], Ooh, that fool Krabs left the Krabby Patty formula behind! ,[knocks over the bottle, opens it and pulls the paper out; he sees a stick of dynamite flaring up in the bottle], Mommy.
,[The dynamite explodes and destroys the Chum Bucket.],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, boy-o. I enjoyed it very much. ,[laughs as the debris of the Chum Bucket fall from above],

"[The scene opens up on a shot of the Krusty Krab],
,Narrator:, Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe. ,[Mr. Krabs appears],
,Mr. Krabs:, Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs up], Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!
,Squidward:, ,[wakes from behind the cash register; yawns], What's all the yelling about?
,Mr. Krabs:, Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula. ,[scene flashes back to Mr. Krabs and Plankton],
,Plankton:, Can I have the secret formula?
,Mr. Krabs:, No.
,Plankton:, Okay. ,[walks away],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[voiceover], But he was persistent!
,Plankton:, ,[comes back], Pretty please?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-uh. ,[scene cuts to Plankton holding a costume behind his back],
,Mr. Krabs:, He used disguises! ,[Plankton laughs and pulls a cockroach costume over himself; Mr. Krabs squishes him], Super science! ,[Plankton drips a droplet of chemical into a test tube and drinks it; he is surrounded in a pink cloud and appears as a cockroach; Mr. Krabs steps on him again], Civil disobedience! ,[Plankton is marching, holding a picket sign that states ""I am not a roach""; Mr. Krabs squashes him once more; scene cuts back to the Krusty Krab with Squidward, SpongeBob, and Mr. Krabs], And I always came out on top!
,Squidward:, ,[sarcastically], Fascinating.
,Mr. Krabs:, But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open! ,[Mr. Krabs' eyes bulge out, and he moves them right to left], You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
,Robot:, ,[walks into the Krusty Krab, speaks in robotic voice], What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?
,SpongeBob:, With pleasure, sir!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[moves Squidward out of the way], I'll take this one. ,[to the robot], Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?
,Robot:, Yes please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[loses fake grin he had], You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?
,Robot:, No, thank you. ,[holds up dollar bill], Will this cover it?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, sure. ,[grabs dollar and hands the robot a paper bag], Here you go.
,Robot:, ,[takes the bag and walks toward the door; using green laser beams, it melts the doorway and walks through], Good day.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good. ,[laughs; the dollar bill center pops open and Plankton jumps out],
,Plankton:, AH-HAH!
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!
,Plankton:, That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!
,Mr. Krabs:, Or what?
,Plankton:, ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move. ,[scene cuts to a toilet being flushed; Plankton screams in terror as he slowly gets sucked down into the toilet],
,Plankton:, Curse you, ,[scene cuts inside the water pipe with Plankton, gurgling on water], Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ,[he disappears into the hole],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], And now for the chaser! ,[scene cuts to manhole outside of the Chum Bucket; Plankton pops up out of the manhole, gasping for breath; he jumps out],
,Plankton:, You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands. ,[scene cuts to inside the Chum Bucket],
,Karen:, So? Tell me what happened.
,Plankton:, I don't want to talk about it.
,Karen:, Talking will make you feel better.
,Plankton:, Leave me alone.
,Karen:, That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner...
,Plankton:, And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.
,Karen:, ...and that's why everything you try ends up like this... ,[Karen's screen shows Plankton laughing, about to pull a lever; Mr. Krabs crushes him], and like this... ,[Karen's screen shows Plankton laughing, holding a rubber duck over his head; Mr. Krabs simply smashes him again], and more recently, like this. ,[Karen's screen shows a toilet with a flushing noise.],
,Plankton:, ,[whimpering, starts bawling], I'm a failure!
,Karen:, It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...
,Plankton:, Henchmen?
,Karen:, Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.
,Plankton:, I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language! ,[scene cuts to a dim club with muscular tough guys playing pool; Plankton stands at the door], Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?
,[Scene cuts to Plankton sitting in a wheelchair in the Chum Bucket with a cast and bandages],
,Plankton:, I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.
,Karen:, Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting. ,[as Karen talks, a robotic hand comes out of a panel and pats Plankton, then crushes him], Sorry.
,Plankton:, That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea. ,[while Plankton talks, he ""assembles"" himself together, sticking his eye on, putting his arm in the socket, and matching his legs which are labeled ""left leg"" and ""right leg"" in their appropriate sockets], The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny! ,[he appears with a phone book and slams it on the ground], Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand! ,[scene cuts to Plankton ""dialing"" a number, which is him jumping on the buttons; cuts to Plankton running from the receiver of the phone to the speaker; cuts to Plankton writing a letter to a family member; cuts to Plankton running with his tongue moistening the adhesive on an envelope; cuts to Plankton in a red airplane, skywriting ""CALLING ALL PLANKTON"", but a fish sitting on a bench sneezes and blows away the skywriting; cuts to a montage of differently dressed Plankton], But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds! ,[doorbell rings], They're here! Welcome, brethren! ,[Plankton runs to the door and opens it with a big grin, which quickly fades into a look of disgust and disbelief; he sees a huge group of hick, redneck family members playing music; one of them begins to speak],
,Clem:, ,[hick drawl], Hey, look, everybody! It's cousin Plankton!
,All:, Yee-haw!
,Plankton:, I've been away from home longer than I thought. ,[Clem runs up and shakes Plankton's hand],
,Clem:, ,[hick drawl], Well, howdy, cousin! ,[Plankton stares at his hand, which is dripping after his cousin shook it],
,Plankton:, Uh...
,Clem:, It's me, Clem. O' course, you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Billy Bo-Illy Bonana Fanna Fo-Filly, Doug, Enos... ,[Clem continues introducing the rest of the family; Plankton is crawling on the ground],... Fletcher McGee, Rainchild, Zeke Junior...
,Plankton:, Alright! I get it! I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home. ,[scene cuts to the family inside the Chum Bucket, standing in front of Karen], I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.
,Clem:, ,[whistles from the back of the group], Golly, she sure is purdy, Sheldon.
,Karen:, Sheldon?!
,Plankton:, ,[annoyed], Yes, that's my first name. ,[Karen cracks up; Plankton keeps an angry face],
,Karen:, Sheldon? ,[laughing],
,Plankton:, ,[still has an annoyed face], Will you please-!
,Karen:, ,[still laughing], Sorry!
,Plankton:, All right, as I was saying... ,[Karen starts laughing], Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.
,Karen:, ,[laughing], Okay, okay. I'm done. No more.
,Plankton:, Good. Ahem, to continue. ,[turns away from Karen; he doesn't see the screen that she brings down behind him; the word ""SHELDON"" appears on the screen], Only you can bring honor... ,[the family laughs; Plankton turns around to look at the screen; it is blank], ...and dignity... ,[the word ""SHELDON"" with a finger pointing at Plankton appears; the group laughs, and Plankton turns to look at the screen, which is now blank], ...back to the Plankton name. ,[as soon as Plankton speaks, another ""SHELDON"" sign appears with an arrow pointing at Plankton; he turns around to look at the screen and is trembling with fury; as he starts to speak, another ""SHELDON"" sign appears], For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for... ,[Plankton turns around and points at the sign], Aha! ,[he runs to the outlet and unplugs it], Okay, that's enough! ,[Karen says ""Sheldon! Ha Ha!"" before losing power; Plankton runs in front of Karen's screen], Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?
,Family Member 1:, But what's in it for us? ,[the family roars in agreement],
,Plankton:, Well, what do you want?
,Family Member 2:, Gawrsh. Can I get a new string for my banjo? ,[holds up a banjo with one string],
,Family Member 3:, And another boot to match this'n? ,[holds up foot with a boot on it],
,Family Member 4:, ,[holds up laptop], And some more memory for my laptop!
,Clem:, And what about root beer?
,All:, Root beer?!
,Plankton:, Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink! ,[the group cheers], Victory, thy name is Plankton! ,[Plankton turns to face the cheering crowd; on his back is a note taped on with the word ""Sheldon."" The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab; Squidward and Mr. Krabs are at the register],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...
,Plankton:, ,[over megaphone], Attention Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.
,Mr. Krabs:, What?! ,[Plankton is standing outside the Krusty Krab with a megaphone],
,Plankton:, ,[over megaphone], I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab! ,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward run outside to Plankton],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah, you and what army, bug?
,Plankton:, What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs! ,[scene pans out to show the Krusty Krab surrounded by something green],
,Mr. Krabs:, You planted grass?
,Plankton:, GRASS?!? ,[Plankton laughs as his family joins him.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-oh. ,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward run into the Krusty Krab with the Plankton family behind them; and a blackout, within the Krusty Krab are shaking and thudding noises, as if in a fight; scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' face], You'll never get away with it, Plankton. ,[Mr. Krabs is in the toilet, with only his head exposed, surrounded by Plankton],
,Plankton:, You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination. ,[laughs],
,Plankton:, Silence! ,[Plankton jumps on the flushing lever and sends Mr. Krabs spinning around], I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys? ,[Plankton snaps his finger and his family assembles into a giant human hand and ear; they twist the lock, figuring out the combination], That's it, a little to the left...
,Mr. Krabs:, Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear! ,[the family opens the safe and inside is the secret formula in a bottle],
,Plankton:, Hot dog! ,[Plankton hops up the stairs to the formula], Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine! ,[Plankton pulls the cork from the bottle and smells it as if it were champagne; he pulls the formula out of the bottle], Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!
,Family:, ,[variously], Ahem.
,Plankton:, Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family. ,[goes back to Mr. Krabs, who is still stuck in the toilet],
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.
,Plankton:, Begging won't help.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.
,Plankton:, Eye.
,Mr. Krabs:, Eye.
,Plankton:, I don't care. Drum roll please! ,[Plankton rolls himself a snare drum roll on the snare drum, then runs to Mr. Krabs' office, where a book labeled ""Recipe for a Krabby Patty"" sits on Mr. Krabs' desk and cymbal crash is heard], Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good. ,[opens book], The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton! Wait!
,Plankton:, ,[turns page], ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm warning ya...!
,Plankton:, ,[turns page], ...A cup of love...!
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't do it!
,Plankton:, ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...! ,[turns page], ...Plankton?! ,[Plankton stares wide eyed at the formula and looks at Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, I warned ya.
,Plankton:, ,[screams while running all the way back home to the Chum Bucket],
,[Back in the Krusty Krab, the book falls on the ground and the family reads the recipe and gasps; they all run screaming while Mr. Krabs laughs, except for Clem who just stands staring at the book],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey. Why ain't you running?
,Clem:, Well, I can't read.
,Mr. Krabs:, Get out of here! ,[Clem runs away laughing goofily while Mr. Krabs gets himself out of the toilet; Squidward rubs his head and comes out of the toilet as well as he rubs his head; SpongeBob arrives],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, guys. Did I miss anything? ,[Squidward picks up the formula],
,Squidward:, Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?
,Mr. Krabs:, Of course not! ,[He points to the Chum Bucket with his thumb], And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out. ,[Mr. Krabs starts laughing and hopping up and down],
,Squidward:, Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps and runs to his house, screaming], Curse you, Squidward! ,[episode ends],

,Karen:, Plankton!
,Plankton:, What? What is it, Karen? Can't you see I'm working there?! ,[points right close to the electronic components of The Analyzer],
,Karen:, Yes, but I wanted you to show you my new screensaver. ,[Shows a screensaver full of flying cake mixers], What do you think?
,Plankton:, ,[sarcastically, not looking at her, and still building electrical components], Great.
,Karen:, ,[rolls towards Plankton], You didn't even look.
,Plankton:, Ehh... ,[looks at Karen], No, I didn't! Can't you see I'm working on my new molecular analyzer? ,[The Analyzer starts picturing whatever Plankton says], Now all I need is the smallest molecule of a patty and the formula will be mine!
,Karen:, Just tell me if I should permanently upload the screensaver!

,SpongeBob:, Now, tell SpongeBob why you and Karen got into a fight.
,Plankton:, I don't know, I was just doing the same things I always do.
,SpongeBob:, Well, if Karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do!
,Plankton:, But I'm the best.
,SpongeBob:, Well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive.
,Plankton:, Me, aggressive?! How dare you?! ,[punches and smacks SpongeBob's spongy body until he becomes exhausted], Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person! ,[blushes then shakes SpongeBob's right eye], I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?

,Patrick:, Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!
,Plankton:, Will you stop that?! There's no one behind you! You're the dimwit.
,Patrick:, Oh. Thanks!
,SpongeBob:, All right, Plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. Try holding a door for someone. It's simple, and it makes people happy. Like this. ,[opens door], After you.
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], I'm happy, SpongeBob! ,[kisses SpongeBob as he enters through the door; SpongeBob laughs as he closes it], Can someone get me out of here? ,[SpongeBob opens the door], Whew!

,[Plankton turns to Patrick, who is in a goofy appearance.],
,Plankton:, Uh...Patrick, you're not a total moron. Just half of one.

,Plankton:, Fine. Your color pink is not so repugnant.
,Patrick:, Thanks! I like...um...your antennas.
,Plankton:, What? What's wrong with my antennas?!
,SpongeBob:, Plankton, Patrick was complimenting you.
,Plankton:, Yeah, right! You two are mocking me! ,[punches SpongeBob and Patrick's bodies],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob? Do you think this is working?
,SpongeBob:, No, I think we better try something else.

,Plankton:, It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now.

,Plankton:, That's a great idea! I'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit! ,[laughs but turns to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, That wasn't even close to what I said.
,Plankton:, Sure it was. And I know just how to do it. ,[mimics cat meow],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I feel uncomfortable.
,[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. Plankton is straightening out his bowtie and SpongeBob is in a handmade robot costume.],
,SpongeBob:, Plankton, are you sure about this?
,Plankton:, Of course I'm sure! Now, start doing a robot voice. Remember, you're not SpongeBob anymore; you're Shelby Naughtica.
,SpongeBob:, ,[in robot voice], Oh, I like that! ,[enters the Chum Bucket with Plankton], Boop beep! Beep boop boop!
,Karen:, Welcome to the Chum Bucket! ,[notices Plankton], Oh. It's you. What do you want?

,Karen:, Here we go. I whipped up a special batch of chum for you, and for your lovely robot date, a bucket of grease chock-full of nuts and bolts.
,SpongeBob:, Plankton, I don't want to eat this!
,Plankton:, Don't you ruin this for me, SpongeBoob, just eat it!
,[Plankton and SpongeBob eat their meals as Karen confidently watches them. SpongeBob and Plankton swallow their food.],

,Karen:, ,[scoffs], Oh, brother.
,Plankton:, I never knew what love was until I met you!
,SpongeBob:, Oh! You have made me the happiest girl robot in the world!
,Karen:, Hey, you! Get your hands off my man!
,SpongeBob:, You better step off, lady! No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies. ,[various papers of robot pictures fly out of SpongeBob's costume],
,Plankton:, 1,000 what??!
,Karen:, Oh, well, you're really in love. I won't stand in your way. Plankton's all yours.
,SpongeBob:, YEAH!
,Plankton:, No! The whole point of this scheme was for me to get Karen back, and now you're ruining it!
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes off his costume], Sorry, Plankton. You just said nice things to me.
,Karen:, Wait a second. You're not just being a jerk? You mean, you cooked this whole stupid scheme up to win me back?
,Plankton:, Of course I did. ,[jumps on SpongeBob's head], I'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron.

,Plankton:, Now, Karen, take it easy!

,SpongeBob:, Weee! Gotchya! There you go, little fella. ,[to Patrick], Say, Patrick. Don't you think that Jellyfish Fields has gotten bigger today?
,Patrick:, I don't know, but all of this failure is tiring me out. I'm just gonna take a nap on that rock right over there.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick. I'll go see if there are any jellyfish in that creepy, scary, evil-looking cave over there.
,[,Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord, is shown],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Catches a jellyfish], Aw. You're the charms. If only you didn't sting, you'd make the perfect pet! ,[Jellyfish stings SpongeBob], Oh, well! I guess it's catch and release for now.
,[Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord catches a jellyfish and turns it into a Jellien; soon the Overlord makes more Jelliens. Patrick is shown sleeping. The Jellien engulfs Patrick's entire body and creates a Jellien Patrick. Some Jellien's take the real Patrick away. Tentacles extend out of Jellien Patrick's mouth and place Patrick's jellyfish net in Jellien Patrick into his hand],
,SpongeBob:, ,[steps in front of Patrick], Isn't he the cutest little jellyfish you've ever seen. ,[picks up Jellien jellyfish by the stingers], And he doesn't sting.
,[Jellien Patrick captures numerous jellyfish in his net],
,SpongeBob:, ,[looking at Jellien jellyfish], You don't suppose this is some sort of new breed, huh? ,[places Jellien jellyfish back into net], I think I'll keep this one as a pet. ,[spots Patrick's overfilled net], Whoa!
,Jellien Patrick:, Yes. I too have caught many jellyfish. ,[holding up index finger], Perhaps we shall give one to each of our friends. ,[grins and breaths heavily],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Patrick! That's a great idea.
,[Bubble transition to Squidward's house at night],
,SpongeBob:, Well, we've given a jellyfish to everyone, except Squidward. I'm sure he doesn't want one.
,Jellien Patrick:, He will take one and like it. ,[shoves the Jellien into the mail slot. The Jellien creates a clone], Pleasant dreams, square one.
,SpongeBob:, Hah, back at ya good buddy. ,[Jellien Squidward is behind him],
,Jellien Squidward:, Don't let the bed bugs bite. Ha ha ha.
,SpongeBob:, Um, that's some good advice. Good night, Squidward.
,Jellien Squidward:, There will be plenty of biting this night. RAH!

,SpongeBob:, ,[To Jellien], Tonight, you'll sleep with me little jelly. Goodnight, jellyfish. Goodnight, Gary! Heh, good night little jelly. ,[SpongeBob sleeps. The Jellien tries to climb on SpongeBob, but he wakes up], Ah, I can't sleep. ,[walks downstairs. The Jellien follows him. SpongeBob is watching a horror film and eating popcorn. The Jellien tries to climb on SpongeBob again, but he screams. The Jellien tries to climb on him, once again], Oh, you want some popcorn? Here ya go. ,[tosses popcorn into the Jellien's mouth, causing it to choke], Hey, hey! Are you okay?
,[Bubble transition to morning. The Jellien is shown sleeping],

,[The next customer, who appears normal walks up],
,Martin:, I would like one Krabby Pat-
,Jellien Squidward:, ,[takes out another Krabby Patty], One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise. RAH!
,Martin:, Ugh. Actually I want one with extra mayo!
,[Jellien Squidward and the rest of the Jellien Clones begin hissing and pointing at the lone, normal fish],
,Martin:, W-what's wrong, dudes?
,Jellien Mr. Krabs:, ,[comes out of Mr. Krabs' office], I'm sorry, valued customer. We are currently out of the condiment you call mayonnaise. ,[takes out a Jellien], Please accept this free jellyfish hat instead! ,[puts the Jellien on the normal fish's head], Thank you, come again! ,[leaves],
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks confused], Huh? That's funny. We just received a whole shipment of mayonnaise. ,[walks to the back and spots Jellien Patrick], Patrick?!? What are you doing? Cooking Krabby Patties is my job.
,Jellien Patrick:, I am here to replace you and all of your kind!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], I saw that movie last night, too. Whoops! If you're going work here, you're going to need an official Krusty Krab hat.
,Jellien Patrick:, Hat? ,[grows a Krusty Krab hat on his head],
,SpongeBob:, Say, that's a pretty neat trick! I'm going to get some extra mayonnaise from the back.
,Jellien Patrick:, ,[quickly turns around with his torso still facing the grill], No mayonnaise! ,[uses his mouth tentacles to eat the Krabby Patty SpongeBob was holding then turns back around to cook more Patties],
,SpongeBob:, O...kay? ,[walks into the freezer], He's acting weird today. ,[spots the boxes of mayonnaise], Hey! There's plenty of mayo back here! ,[hears a strange noise], Huh? Is somebody in there? ,[looks into the back and spots the Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord, Jelliens, and all of the citizens trapped in pods], Monsters! Huh? Squidward and Mr. Krabs! Patrick, too! ,[spots Harold], And some random guy! Huh? ,[screams], My spatula! It's just like that movie I watched last night! Those things have captured everyone and put them into creepy pods. ,[walks out of the freezer, nervously walking past Jellien Patrick], Hi, uh, Patrick? I gotta...clean the tables...Patrick. Ha ha...Patrick. ,[walks out backwards with Jellien Squidward then surprising him],
,Jellien Squidward:, Hi, SpongeBob! Don't you want this cute little jellyfish? ,[the Jellien then hisses at SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Ha ha...uh, no thanks. ,[continues walking backwards and bumps into Jellien Mr. Krabs], Ah! Mr. Krabs!
,Jellien Mr. Krabs:, You seem tired, SpongeBob. Why don't you go home and take a nap? ,[hisses strangely at SpongeBob],
,Jellien Squidward:, ,[still holding a Jellien], Yes, and you can use this jelly as a pillow.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's okay. I-I have one at home. Hah... ,[continues walking backwards until he is scared off by more Jellien Clones until he reaches the door],
,Jellien Squidward and Jellien Mr. Krabs:, Sleep well.

,Jellien Harold:, Re-

I can feel their creepy, rope-like tentacles now! ,[suddenly is roped and drag into Sandy's treedome and is locked down],
,Sandy:, Alright, you rotten jelly clone! What have you done with SpongeBob?!
,SpongeBob:, I'm no clone, Sandy! I am SpongeBob!
,Sandy:, Then you won't mind if I run a simple test. ,[starts tickling him and he starts laughing hysterically], You're SpongeBob, alright...
,[Bubble transition to where SpongeBob is free],
,SpongeBob:, What are we going to do, Sandy?
,Sandy:, If only we knew the Jellien's weakness.
,SpongeBob:, Well, the only thing I know is that they can't stand mayonnaise.
,Sandy:, Ew, I don't like mayonnaise neither.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks suspiciously at Sandy], Oh, so you don't like mayo? Just like a Jellien!
,Sandy:, ,[smacks SpongeBob], Oh, snap out of it, SpongeBob! Now if only we had some mayonnaise.
,SpongeBob:, There's lot at the Krusty Krab! But we'll never get past them! ,[points to a bunch of Jellien Clones just outside the dome],
,Sandy:, Not to worry! ,[takes out glasses that looks like the Jellien's eyes], We'll be in disguise.
,[They both walk outside the dome whistling as they walk up to a Jellien Clone],
,Sandy:, Greetings, fellow clone. I hate mayonnaise.

,Jellien Mr. Krabs:, Ah! ,[the mayonnaise lands on him], Ew... ,[he then disintegrates which frees the real Mr. Krabs from his pod],
,Sandy:, It worked, SpongeBob! Keep going!
,SpongeBob:, ,[squirts Jellien Squidward who tried to attack him with mayonnaise destroying him and freeing Squidward in the process],.
,Sandy:, SpongeBob! Look out!
,[All of the Jellien Clones begin to close in to which SpongeBob squirts and destroys all of them. SpongeBob and Sandy then head towards the back running past Jellien Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Jellien Patrick!
,Jellien Patrick:, Hold the mayonnaise!
,SpongeBob:, D'oh! Almost forgot! ,[squirts Jellien Patrick with the mayonnaise, causing him to disintegrate and frees Patrick from his pod],
,Patrick:, ,[wakes up and falls on his neck], D'oh! Hey guys! What's shaking? ,[Squidward nervously points to the Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord and Patrick realizes the situation], Oh...
,[SpongeBob and Sandy enter the freezer to confront the Overlord],
,Sandy:, Hold it right there, you evil blob of slime! You're through 'cause we know your weakness! Show 'em, SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob shows the Overlord the jug of mayonnaise. The Overlord then roars loudly telling the Jelliens to attack SpongeBob and Sandy],
,Sandy:, Let 'er rip!
,SpongeBob:, ,[starts squirting the Jelliens until the jug of mayonnaise starts to act up], Nah! Gasp! Sandy! It's so cold in here the mayonnaise is starting to freeze!
,Sandy:, Then hurry and throw it, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Aye, aye! ,[unscrews the lid of the jug of mayonnaise and hurls it at the Overlord, but it freezes and lands on its head. Then it laughs at SpongeBob's failure], Oh no! This mayonnaise is frozen solid!
,Sandy:, ,[next to a thermostat], Then I'll just turn up the heat! ,[turns the thermostat from ""COLD"" to ""HOT"", causing the mayonnaise to melt on the Overlord's head, thus destroying him and all of the Jelliens],
,SpongeBob and Sandy:, Hooray!
,Mr. Krabs:, What happened?
,SpongeBob:, Well, let me tell ya!
,Narrator:, Eleven minutes later...
,SpongeBob:, And that's why we're covered in goo!
,Mr. Krabs:, Thanks for rescuing us, SpongeBob. But what are we going to do with all of this green slop?
,Patrick:, ,[tastes the green goo], Mmm! Freaky Clone Jelly Relish!

,Mr. Krabs:, Relish Patties! Get your Freaky Clone Jelly Relish Patties! Only four bucks extra!

,SpongeBob:, It's not just a boulder. ,[sniff], It's a rock. ,[cries], A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock. ,[climbs up it and rubs it], Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
,Squidward:, SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... ,[SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder], ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!

,SpongeBob:, But... but... ,[tears start rolling down his face],
,Tom:, Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! ,[throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face], You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well, I ain't buying! ,[slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry],
,Squidward:, Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? ,[SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over], Sponge? ,[Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door],
,Tom:, ,[answers the door, still angry], Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!
,Squidward:, ,[Tom's point of view], Well, this one's on the house! ,[slams the pizza box in Tom's face],
,SpongeBob:, ,[still crying], Did he change his mind?
,Squidward:, ,[smugly], He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.

,[Plankton jumps off the safe and ignites the dynamite sticks with the battery on Mr. Krabs' desk, creating a loud explosion. As the smoke clears, the safe opens. But much to Plankton's chargin, there is another safe inside.],
,Plankton:, What? The old safe in the safe routine?
,[Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton with SpongeBob's arm.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!
,Plankton:, I'm not hungry!
,[Mr. Krabs crushes Plankton with his fists. Plankton is now spattered on his left fist.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Eww. ,[throws away Plankton's antenna], SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob comes in with his right leg on the spot where his nose is.],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir. I see the problem.
,[SpongeBob regrows his left arm and right leg. He uses his spatula to scoop Plankton off of Mr. Krabs' fist. Mr. Krabs opens the window and SpongeBob flings Plankton out with his spatula. Meanwhile, the HAZMAT Unit takes Mr. Stinky out of the restaurant, puts him in a basket tied with balloons, and lets him float back up to the surface. However, the wind blows the balloons and makes the basket go the other direction. The basket floats into Bikini Bottom where Mr. Stinky sprays his fumes once more. The Bikini Bottomites frantically scream and run around as the horrible smell drives them crazy. Back in the restaurant, SpongeBob blows the fumes out with a fan.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whew! That was too close my lad. Three more safes and he would've had me secret formula.
,[Mr. Krabs unlocks the second safe.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Looks like I'm gonna have to beef up security around here.
,[Mr. Krabs pushes the buttons on the third safe and opens up, revealing a steel container inside. Mr. Krabs takes it out and puts it on his desk.],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm gonna need you to do me a big favor, laddie.
,[Mr. Krabs pushes the buttons on the container and it opens up, revealing the bottle with the secret formula inside.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gives SpongeBob the bottle], Take this home with ya and hide it while I reevaluate my security situation.
,[Mr. Krabs throws away the container and pounds on his desk. The vibrations of Mr. Krabs' fists shakes the room which also made SpongeBob drop the bottle.],
,SpongeBob:, But Mr. Krabs, how do you know it will be safe from Plankton at my house?
,Mr. Krabs:, Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate.
,[As Mr. Krabs talks to SpongeBob, the antenna Plankton lost was recording everything and Plankton was listening from outside.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[voiceover], He cannot define the hypothesis. He's a tired clown. He'll never know it's in your house!
,Plankton:, ,[gets an idea], Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there! ,[laughs],
,[The scene changes to closing time at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob quietly sneaks out and tries to go home with the secret formula. Plankton is seen standing by the sign.],
,Plankton:, Hey, there.
,[SpongeBob hides the formula in one of his holes on his back.],
,Plankton:, Pleasant night, eh SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs nervously], Oh, uh, yes. It's a very nighty-night for a walkie.
,Plankton:, Ain't that the truth? Hey, nothing gets past you. One could say you have the formula for honesty.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, yeah. One could say that I guess. Uh, anyway. I gotta go wash my formula. ,[freaks out], Hair! Hair! I gotta go wash my hair! Uh, good night, Plankton.
,[SpongeBob tips his hat, literally revealing the formula on his head. Plankton paused for a bit but relaxes.],
,Plankton:, Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs nervously], Okay, bye!
,[SpongeBob leaves to go home.],
,French Narrator:, The next morning...
,SpongeBob:, Now remember, Gary. I'm entrusting you with the secret formula.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Stay sharp, Gary. Don't let anyone inside.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Gary!
,[Plankton is on a rock, watching SpongeBob and Gary. He sees SpongeBob leave his home to work at the Krusty Krab. Plankton laughs and comes up with a plan. Inside SpongeBob's house, Gary guards the door until he hears a knock.],
,Gary:, Meow.
,[Gary answers the door and sees Plankton in the disguise as a salesman. Plankton gently pets Gary, but Gary growls angrily at him.],
,Plankton:, Why, hey there, little fella!  Is SpongeBob.. ,[clears throat], I mean your master at home? ,[Plankton's fake ear slips, but he pushes it back.], Eh, perhaps I could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products.
,[Plankton opens his case and shows snail care products.],
,Plankton:, Shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys...
,Gary:, Meow! ,[Gary slams the door on Plankton, breaking off part of his disguise.],
,Plankton:, My leg!
,[Gary looks through the window and sees Plankton hopping away on one of his stilts from his disguise.],
,Plankton:, Your friends won't tell ya this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, Smelly!
,French Narrator:, Moments later...
,[Gary is seen reading the paper on SpongeBob's chair, until he hears the doorbell ringing.],
,Gary:, Meow?
,[Gary answers the door and sees Plankton disguise as a girl scout selling cookies.],
,Plankton:, Hello, sir... ,[clears throat and talks in a higher voice], Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.
,[Plankton sits on the sofa with the cookie box and holds out a list.],
,Plankton:, How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them. ,[regular voice], If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help.
,[It's soon shown that the sofa was pushed outside of the house with Plankton on it.],
,Gary:, Meow, meow!
,[Gary slams the door. Plankton got so mad, he threw the cookie box on the ground and the box exploded.],
,Plankton:, ,[dazed], Note to self: Nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract. ,[his antennas are blown to dust and he faints],
,French Narrator:, More moments later...
,[Gary is seen growling at the window where he spots Plankton making faces at him. Gary comes out of the house.],
,Gary:, Meow?
,[Gary discovers that it was just a decoy and growls in frustration. As he goes to look for Plankton, a hole is seen on the bottom of the house. Inside, it's revealed that the hole was made by Plankton who was actually biting his way in. Plankton spits the pineapple out of his mouth.],
,Plankton:, I forgot how much I hate pineapple.
,[Gary continues to look for Plankton from the living room to the kitchen. As Gary slithered by his litter box, Plankton pops his head out. Gary looked suspiciously at his litter box, but continues looking for Plankton.],
,Plankton:, ,[munches on the snail litter], Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple. ,[swallows], Now, where is that secret formula?
,[Plankton hops out and runs into the living room],
,Plankton:, Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere.
,[Plankton knocks down a table with a plant.],
,Plankton:, Nothin' in there. ,[sees one of the hooks on SpongeBob's decoration], Ooh, look at that.
,[Plankton grabs the hook and pops SpongeBob's chair. He knocks over the table and looks in the shellphone.],
,Plankton:, Hello!
,[His voice echoes. Plankton jumps on the wall and rips the wallpaper off.],
,Plankton:, Where the barnacles is it?
,[Plankton rips the floor and sees nothing underneath.],
,Plankton:, Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not foolin' anybody! I went to college!
,[Plankton runs into the kitchen, opens the fridge, and jumps up and down to find the formula. He climbs on the stove and knocks over the fridge. Then he knocks over the stove, walks through the pipe and went into the cupboards.],
,Plankton:, Nope, nope, nope.
,[As he is searching, he throws some dishes, kitchen appliances, and a huge trash can. He comes out with a turkey baster. Plankton thought that the baster could come in handy and puts it in his pocket. Gary is napping in SpongeBob's room until he hears the commotion from downstairs.], 
,[He goes to see what's making the noise. Plankton manages to hide himself from Gary. Once the coast is clear, he runs upstairs to SpongeBob's room. Gary spots Plankton going upstairs and shutting the door. Plankton searches through SpongeBob's room to find the formula.],
,[A light bulb pops out from Gary's eye and lights up, giving Gary an idea on how to catch Plankton.],
,[Plankton comes out of SpongeBob's room and heads downstairs. On his way down, he slips on Gary's slime, lands and bounces off a mattress and gets flown into the ceiling fan. The fan spins him around and throws him through the basketball net. Plankton falls through the pipe and lands on a record player. Gary snickers as he caught Plankton into his trap. The player spins Plankton around until he gets caught on the needle. The player flies Plankton onto a board and he lands on a puddle of glue where he gets stuck. The bowling ball on the stool rolls down and board, squishes Plankton, rolls across the floor, and hits ten flower pots like knocking down bowling pins. Then a small vacuum cleaner comes out, sucks up the dirt and broken pottery, and traps Plankton inside. Plankton pops out of the vacuum gasping for air.],
,Plankton:, Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!
,Gary:, Meow!
,Plankton:, Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
,[Gary fights Plankton with his eye stalks. During the fight, Plankton notices an opening in Gary's shell.],
,Plankton:, Of course! What a fool I've been!
,[Plankton climbs into Gary's shell. Inside, the shell has random things covered in slime.],
,Plankton:, SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh? ,[turns around and sees Gary's eye following him], Aye yae yae!
,[Gary's eye chases Plankton up, down, left, and right all around the inside of his shell. It wasn't long until SpongeBob returned home from work.],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, I'm home!
,[SpongeBob gasps in shock to see that his house is completely demolished.],
,SpongeBob:, What happened here? ,[gasps], My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren! ,[gasps], My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times! ,[gasps], My glass of water! ,[teary], I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!
,[It's revealed that SpongeBob hid the formula on top of his television in disguise as an antenna.],
,SpongeBob:, Whew! It's safe and right where I left it.
,[SpongeBob notices Gary with his left eye in his shell and growling.],
,SpongeBob:, Gary, did you do this?
,Gary:, ,[growls],
,SpongeBob:, What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?
,Gary:, Meow, meow!
,SpongeBob:, Something's not right, Gary.
,[Gary pulls his eye back out of his shell.],
,SpongeBob:, I'd better get you to the vet.
,Gary:, Meow.
,[Meanwhile, inside Gary's shell, Plankton continues running around until he reaches a dead-end, which he almost falls into a deep hole.],
,Plankton:, Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!
,[Suddenly, something tilts the shell and Plankton falls into the hole. He lands into the shell's center.],
,Plankton:, Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell. ,[he sees a piece of paper stuck in the slime], What's that? ,[opens it], This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!
,[Just then, a shimmering light appears.],
,Plankton:, The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory! ,[sighs],
,[However, the light was actually coming from the vet where the doctor opened Gary's shell to find Plankton hallucinating from the fumes inside. And the paper he found is actually a shopping list.],
,Doctor:, Well, that's odd. Who's that?
,SpongeBob:, Hey, it's Plankton.
,Doctor:, What's he got there?
,SpongeBob:, Looks like one of my old grocery lists.
,Doctor:, I don't know how he got in there, but the gases inside this shell are making the little guy hallucinate. He would've smelled the gases if he had a nose like most good-hearted people. ,[sniffs],
,Plankton:, Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!
,[Plankton, still hallucinating, runs out of the vet with the shopping list. The doctor, Gary, and SpongeBob watch strangely as he runs off into the sunset.],
,Plankton:, I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!

"[The camera zooms in on Sandy's treedome. There is a silhouette of Sandy in the tree],
,Sandy:, ,[Sandy puts down her blowtorch and her mask], Almost done... Could you hand me that wrench, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Nu uh uh! Lab Partner!
,Sandy:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, You called me SpongeBob. I thought we agreed to address each other by our proper titles.
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Uh ta ta ta! Lab Partner!
,[Sandy takes the wrench in front of SpongeBob. SpongeBob looks sad],
,Sandy:, There! It's finished! Now I can hide my nuts back in Texas without leavin' my lab!
,[She picks up a pile of nuts and puts them in her machine and pulls a lever. The machine rumbles, and a lightbulb blinks. The camera then shows Sandy and SpongeBob watching],
,Sandy:, ,[A big blast occurs. The nuts were not in the machine], It worked! Hooray! ,[She hugs SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, We did it!
,[Then the machine rumbles again, and the nuts appear right next to the machine],
,Sandy:, Aw, nuts!
,[The camera zooms on the Chum Bucket, and a shot of Plankton's lab appears. Plankton is seen working on a machine with cloth over it.. He puts down his blowtorch and mask],
,Plankton:, Finally! The day has come!
,Karen:, You mean Thursday?
,Plankton:, No! It's the day I steal the Krabby Patty secret formula from Krabs!
,Karen:, And why, pretell, is today different from the other days you failed to steal it?
,Plankton:, ,[growls], Because today I have completed my greatest invention. Behold! ,[he said as he took the cloth off his machine],
,Karen:, What exactly am I beholding? A vegetable steamer?
,Plankton:, This is no ordinary vegetable steamer, Karen, my computer wife. It's my latest invention! And isn't she a beauty. Meow. ,[he hugs the steamer],
,Karen:, Oh, brother. ,[she rolls her eyes],
,Plankton:, Sweetie, you're going to help me achieve my defined purpose, aren't you, yes? And steal the Krabby Patty recipe! Muhahahahaha! ,[A ding goes off], It's ready! ,[He comes back wearing a pink bath towel. He opens a small door in his steamer. Steam goes everywhere], Oh, boy. ,[He sits down], Whew! Man, is it hot in here.
,Broccoli:, ,[A broccoli comes on camera, wearing the same robe], Tell me about it.
,Plankton:, ,[Plankton pulls a switch, and he comes out the steamer in a gaseous form], It worked! In this new gaseous form, I will be able to silently squeeze through the cracks of the Krusty Krab. ,[evil laugh],
,[He bursts out the Chum Bucket, still laughing, and squeezes into the Krusty Krab.. Mr. Krabs is seen, mumbling, ""Money, money, money, money!"". Plankton goes in Krabs' office],
,Plankton:, Hehehehe!
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, how much is that- Mr. Krabs gets cut off by Plankton going through his eyes. ,[Krabs sniffs the air], Eugh!
,Plankton:, Finally, the moment has come! ,[Krabs gets out an fan and blows Plankton away], No, no, no no no! ,[He gets blown out of the Krusty Krab towards Sandy's treedome, and into Sandy's face],
,Sandy:, ,[holding her nose], Eugh. ,[picks up her blowtorch and uses it all around],
,Plankton:, Hey! Cut it out!
,SpongeBob:, Plankton? is that you?
,Plankton:, Of course it's me, you moron.
,Sandy:, You were able to convert yourself into gaseous form? Facinatin'!
,Plankton:, Huh? Wait!
,[Sandy puts him in a jar and puts him in the freezer. Sandy waits, and then takes it out. She shakes Plankton out, and he turns to normal],
,Sandy:, I guess I never realized you were such a student of science. Maybe you could help me fix my nut transporter.
,Plankton:, Eh? Did you say transporter? ,[cuts to Plankton looking at the transporter], Interesting. ,[climbs in the transporter], Hey! Maybe if I combine this device with my own invention, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! I mean, I think I have the right parts in my lab, maybe?
,Sandy:, We're in business! ,[cuts to Sandy and Plankton are walking into his lab], Say! This is a dandy lab!
,Plankton:, Is that good?
,Sandy:, Hahahaha! Does a pig play poker?
,Plankton:, I guess...
,[Sandy looks through test tubes],
,Sandy:, I should have visited you before. What, with you and me being the only two scientists in town.
,Plankton:, Haha, yes.
,[SpongeBob comes in, carrying the transporter],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir. The lab is amazing.
,Plankton:, Do you really like it?
,Sandy:, And how! ,[SpongeBob falls on the floor by the weight of the teleporter],
,SpongeBob:, Here's your teleporter, lab partner.
,Sandy:, ,[picks it up], Thanks, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Can you please call me lab partner?
,Sandy:, So where do I hook up my teleporter?
,Plankton:, Oh, just plug it into that doohickey over there. ,[points to the steamer],
,Karen:, Just who are you calling a doohickey?
,Sandy:, Wowee! Is that a real mark-three surplus wifeomatic? She is beautiful.
,Karen:, Oh, why, thank you.
,Plankton:, No, not that doohickey. This doohickey! Just plug your teleporter into my device, and with our combined power we shall conquer the world! [breathes heavily]
,Sandy:, Uh-huh. Or I can combine your gasifier with my invention and transform my nuts into a gaseous cloud that transports them back to Texas!
,Plankton:, Heh. Yes, that's what I meant.
,[Sandy plugs her machine into the gasifyer and the transporter gleamed light from it],
,Sandy:, YES! It's working at last, new lab partner! [Plankton hops up to hi-five Sandy]
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I guess you won't be needing me anymore. ,[The camera shows SpongeBob's heart breaking. Sandy sees SpongeBob leaving],
,Plankton:, That's right. And don't let the door hit you on the way out!
,Sandy:, Hold on! You can't go, SpongeBob. We need you.
,Plankton:, What! He'll just get in the way!
,SpongeBob:, Need me? [sniffs] How could I help? I'm not even a [sniffs] scientist.
,Sandy:, Why, you'll have the most important job of all! You'll be our test monkey.
,SpongeBob:, ,[face lit up], Test monkey, ,[cuts to SpongeBob putting on a monkey suit and acts like one], Test monkey reporting for duty!
,Plankton:, A test monkey? ,[cries], I... I've never had a test monkey before! ,[cries again. Hops up on Sandy], There is some mad scientist in you after all! Muhahahaha! ,[Sandy joins in laughing], Okay, we really have to work on your evil laugh. ,[cuts to Sandy putting a connector in one of SpongeBob's holes],

,Plankton:, Roger! ,[pulling a lever], Urgh! Just a sec. ,[has difficulty pulling it. as it goes down, SpongeBob's eyes disappear],

,Squidward:, Where is that idiot SpongeBob, leaving me stuck with all the cooking? This job stinks! ,[sniffs the air], Eugh. Literally. ,[looks at SpongeBob's eyeballs, which appeared right next to him; screams and rushes into Mr. Krabs' office], Mr. Krabs! ,[knocks off all of Mr. Krabs' money], You gotta come with me! There's something in the kitchen you gotta see! ,[cuts to the lab],

,Squidward:, See for yourself! ,[Mr. Krabs sniffs the air],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sniffs the air], Eugh! I see. So it was you that befouled me office earlier, was it? ,[cuts to Sandy and Plankton adding 2 more tubes],
,Sandy:, Just a few more adjustments...
,Plankton:, Okay. Let her rip!
,SpongeBob:, Do you think this is a good look for me? Or is it too flashy?
,Sandy:, ,[pulls 2 levers], Stand clear!
,SpongeBob:, Clear of what? ,[cuts to Squidward mopping the bathroom],
,Squidward:, Something weird is going on around here ,[SpongeBob's mouth appears],
,SpongeBob's mouth:, Hi, Squidward.
,Squidward:, ,[screams], Mr. Krabs! There's a strange sound coming from the restroom! ,[cuts to Sandy],
,Sandy:, Hm. Now only his mouth is missing.
,Plankton:, Shut it down. ,[Sandy pulls a lever, and SpongeBob's mouth disappears.], ,[cuts to Mr. Krabs going in],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ugh! For crying out loud, Squidward, what the heck is wrong with you? ,[cuts to SpongeBob having many tubes on him],
,Sandy:, Test 3! ,[pulls the lever. cuts to Squidward],
,Squidward:, I cannot believe I have to deliver all this junk food myself. ,[slips on a Krabby Patty and falls], What the- ,[SpongeBob's legs and arms appear, and gives Squidward the orders], Oh, thank you. ,[SpongeBob's hand shows three first fingers meaning with pleasure. Goes to Mr. Krabs, who hears the yelling and turns up his radio. Cuts to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Look, no hands! Or feet. ,[laughs],
,Sandy:, Well, we're getting closer. ,[Sandy and Plankton put goggles filled with many, many tubes on SpongeBob], Goggles!

,Mr. Krabs:, Ooh. Neptune's trousers, Squidward! Maybe you should just lay off the broccoli for a while. ,[cuts to SpongeBob back in the lab],
,Sandy:, ,[picks up SpongeBob], It worked! We transported his whole body this time!
,Plankton:, Yes! My plan worked! And now I have no further use for you two goody goodies! ,[presses a button, trapping Sandy and SpongeBob], Using your technology, I shall teleport myself directly to the Krusty Krab and the Krabby Patty formula ,[singing in high voice], will be mine! ,[laughs evilly and he teleports himself],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in sorrow], Oh no! Plankton has finally won! And we, we helped him.
,Sandy:, Not exactly, Lab Partner. ,[presses a button and the trap rose. she then presses another button and the Krabby Patty formula appears],
,SpongeBob:, ,[picks it up], The Krabby Patty formula! But if that's here, then where's Plankton? ,[cuts to Plankton],
,Plankton:, Fools! I played them like a 32-bit synthesizer! ,[evil laugh], Now where is that formula? ,[He looks around and his flashlight goes off], The formula is gone? ,[yells], No! ,[cuts to Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you hear something?
,Squidward:, ,[mopping], I don't hear a thing, but something stinks. ,[cut back to Sandy],
,Sandy:, Aw, I knew Plankton was hatching an evil plan the whole time. So I just adjusted the controls to put Plankton where he can't do any harm. Nobody fools a squirrel from Texas! ,[episode ends with Sandy laughing evilly],

,SpongeBob:, Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque. ,[cut to SpongeBob putting a vacuum on his face then using a rolling pin to make his face shine.

,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
,Mr. Krabs:, Take your time. ,[SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down],
,SpongeBob:, No, no, no, no, no. ,[Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up], I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!

,[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty],

,Mr. Krabs:, So, uhh, no penny, huh?
,SpongeBob:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Darn! ,[cuts to later when SpongeBob is mopping, and hears a noise],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working.
,Squidward:, Me, too.
,SpongeBob:, Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?
,Squidward:, Never. ,[SpongeBob and Squidward are now walking out back],

,Mr. Krabs:, Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart. ,[Mr. Krabs shows some images], Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs.

,SpongeBob:, I would like to donate a penny.
,Mr. Krabs:, You would?
,SpongeBob:, If I only had one! ,[SpongeBob starts crying, Mr. Krabs' eyes go into his head, and he screams. The scene then cuts to SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs is using a flower delivery truck to spy on his house, he is speaking gibberish, he notices SpongeBob walking out the door, he walks in, with a metal detector, and then Mr. Krabs looks around],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it.

,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks. ,[gasps], And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny. ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, It wasn't?
,SpongeBob:, No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that. ,[Gary sniffs it, then blows a raspberry at it, and walks away, the gum then absorbs the spit], Hey, this isn't gum at all. ,[pulls it out, revealing that it is a $500 bill], It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah, well, good night, Gary. 
,[turns off the light, then zooms out revealing that Mr. Krabs is digging holes outside of his house looking for the penny],
,Mr. Krabs:, Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.

,Patrick:, ,[chuckles], You can't get to my stomach now, white coral ball. ,[eats the coral ball],
,SpongeBob:, ,[to Gary], Okay, Gary. I'll be home by ten. ,[starts walking to the door, then stops, then turns to Patrick], Dear Patrick, just do verify. ,[counts using his fingers], First, you feed Gary, then you pet Gary, then you-
,Patrick:, ,[interrupts SpongeBob], SpongeBob! ,[walks up to SpongeBob], Don't you trust me? I am the most responsible guy you know!
,SpongeBob:, ,[shrugs his shoulders], You know what? You're right.
,Patrick:, Well, of course I am! ,[pushes SpongeBob out the door], Now, go see your Grandma. Gary's in good hands. ,[closes the door, then walks back up to Gary], Yep! Looks like it's just you and me, friend.
,Gary:, Meow.
,Patrick:, Hmmm... I wonder what we should do first. ,[takes the list written by SpongeBob, reading it upside down, then he scratches his head], You need to work on your handwriting, SpongeBob. I don't need this anyway. ,[crumples the list up, then throws it away], Oh! I know! Let's go for a walk! ,[takes out a leash],
,Gary:, ,[pants happily],
,Patrick:, ,[his stomach growls], Oh. Looks like my tummy is having an argument with the coral balls. Ohhh... ,[runs to a restroom],
,Gary:, ,[sighs], ,[scene changes to the outside of SpongeBob's pineapple, changing from sunset to night],
,Patrick:, ,[walks out of the restroom, then sighs], Better. ,[as he walks back in the kitchen, he sees Gary all dried up],
,Gary:, ,[weak voice], Meow.
,Patrick:, Oh, hey, friend! What's up?
,Gary:, ,[still in a weak voice], Meow. ,[as his stomach growls, he points to it using his tail, then he tries biting off the bag of snail food], Meow.
,Patrick:, Step aside, Barry. Let me show you how it's done. ,[picks up the bag, ravenously bites it off, then sniffs the inside of it], Ooh. Gotta try a bite of this. ,[eats all of what is inside the bag, with some of the food falling on Gary], Ahh. ,[burps], Good stuff.
,Gary:, ,[mumbles angrily],
,Patrick:, I wonder what SpongeBob's got for you in the fridge. ,[opens the refrigerator, looking for something for Gary],
,[Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's Grandma's house...],
,Grandma:, ,[while wearing a birthday hat], I hope you saved room for dessert, SpongeBob. ,[brings out a cake],
,SpongeBob:, ,[while holding a fork and a knife, and also wearing a party hat], Oh, Grandma, you shouldn't have. It's your birthday, I should be serving you!
,Grandma:, Awww... I know how much you love sweets, and I know how much you love your pet snail, so I made you this special gelatin mold. ,[close-up of a gelatin cake with a gelatin Gary on top of it],
,SpongeBob:, Gary. Oh, Gary. ,[thinks to what Patrick said earlier in the day],
,Patrick:, He's safe with me. ,[drops Gary],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[stands up, worried], Grandma, can I please use your phone?
,Grandma:, Of course!
,SpongeBob:, Thank you. ,[rushes to the phone, then types in the number],
,Patrick:, ,[answers the phone], Hello?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, it's SpongeBob. How's Gary?
,Patrick:, Oh, Gary! Yeah, he's fine.
,Gary:, ,[rolls up to Patrick], Meow. ,[his stomach growls, then Patrick laughs along with him],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Sounds like you got everything under control. Oh, and make sure to give Gary his bath. ,[hangs up, then sighs],
,Patrick:, ,[hangs up, puts Gary down, and sits on the couch, then smells Gary, and then puts his face away], Whew! SpongeBob was right. You need a bath! ,[while walking to the kitchen, Gary can smell his pungent pit odor, then Patrick turns the kitchen sink on, and water comes out], Oh! I almost forgot. ,[picks up the bag of snail food], Snail food!
,Gary:, ,[happily], Meow!
,Patrick:, ,[puts the snail food in the sink], Gotta get the water to stay in there somehow. ,[sees Gary trying to eat the snail food], Now, Gary, we don't eat the bath. We get in the bath. ,[the snail food sinks in the water], Come on, Gary. ,[a demonic Gary growls], Oh, don't be difficult now, Gary. ,[Gary tries to bite Patrick], Gary! ,[sees growling Gary on top of the refrigerator], There you are! ,[Gary jumps down the refrigerator, and runs out of the kitchen, then Patrick tries to chase him, but keeps slipping on Gary's slime trail until he hits the TV, landing on top of his head, then takes it off, and throws it away as the phone rings], Oh, what now? ,[answers the phone], SquarePants household.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, Patrick, about Gary's bath, make sure the bath water is not too hot, and he doesn't like too many bubbles.
,Patrick:, Yeah, yeah.
,SpongeBob:, And remember to dry him off really good.
,Patrick:, All right.
,SpongeBob:, And don't forget about the list!
,Patrick:, ,[angry], Okay, I get it, SpongeBob! I get it, I get it! ,[tries to throw the phone out of the window, but it comes back in, and hits Patrick in the head], No! ,[slides on Gary's slime trail up the stairs and flying straight into the bathtub/shower in SpongeBob's bathroom, then Patrick's head is covering the drain as he tries to get out by pulling the shower sprinkler, which breaks and water comes out, as one of Patrick's eyes is closed from the water], I don't get these new beguiled shower heads. ,[opens the door to call for Gary], ,[high-pitched], Gary! Time for your- ,[normal voice], ,[to himself], Wait a minute, Patrick! You gotta trick the snail! ,[points to himself using both hands], You gotta be smarterer than him! ,[walks up to Gary], Hey, buddy! I got something cool to show you. And it's the opposite of a wet watery bath. ,[puts on a welding mask], Take it down! ,[uses a flamethrower to burn down SpongeBob's bed],
,Gary:, ,[worried], Meow!
,Patrick:, Doesn't that look fun?
,Gary:, ,[still worried], ,[high-pitched], Meow! ,[runs out of SpongeBob's bedroom],
,Patrick:, Well, make up your mind! Is it water or fire? ,[turns on the fire blaster for a couple seconds, then Gary runs into SpongeBob's kitchen storage and jumps on one of the shelves as Patrick walks in, too, with a hose], Okay, Gary. If you don't come to the bath, then the bath's gonna come to you. ,[turns on the hose which sprays Gary], That's a good boy! Now, suds up! ,[close-up of a box of soap flakes that Patrick's holding], ,[Patrick pours it on the water as the soap flakes and water both aim at Gary, filling up the entire storage],
,Gary:, ,[in a bubbly voice], Meow!
,Patrick:, That wasn't so bad, now was it?
,Gary:, ,[a can falls on his belly], Oww!
,Patrick:, ,[walks up to Gary], Oh, now we gotta dry you off. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any salt. So, I'll have to use the next best thing! ,[uses a hair dryer to dry off Gary as Gary's eyes shatter a little, then Patrick puts a very dry and old-looking Gary on the table], There! Doesn't that feel better? Okay! ,[sits down on the couch], Let's see, Gary's eaten, he's had his bath, Time to watch the TV! ,[after seeing a broken TV for only a couple seconds, Patrick falls asleep as the broken shower stills fall water, crawling down the stairs, and also, water from the kitchen sink and from the hose is still running, too, then while Patrick's still sleeping, water fills up the living room floor, and just then, water comes down from upstairs, making the whole house flooded, then the table and couch where Gary and Patrick are both sitting on start to move as Patrick wakes up and sees Gary moving on water after coming back up from under it], Sheesh, Gary! Well, if you wanted another bath, why didn't you just ask?
,Gary:, ,[annoyed], Meow! ,[all the things in the living room, including Gary and Patrick, move, and Patrick evenly gets caught with the upstairs water],
,[Meanwhile, back at SpongeBob's grandma's house...],
,SpongeBob:, ,[brings out Grandma's birthday cake with a bunch of candles, singing], ♪Happy Birthday dear old Grandma, Grandma, Grandma! The best Grandma in the world, Grandma, Grandma!♪ ,[puts the cake on the table],
,Grandma:, ,[close-up of all the candles on the cake], Oh, dear! Look at all those candles! Why, if I were any older, we'd be in danger of burning down the house!
,SpongeBob:, ,[thinks about his house being on fire, and Gary meows in the background], ,[worried], Grandma, can I use your phone again?
,Grandma:, Go ahead, dear. But there may not be any cake left when you get back! ,[takes a deep breath, then starts trying to blow all the candles out],
,[the outside of SpongeBob's pineapple moves around in circles],
,Patrick:, ,[giggles as the phone rings, then answers the phone], SquareyPants' house.
,SpongeBob:, Just checking, is everything okay over there?
,Patrick:, ,[bored], Who is this?
,SpongeBob:, ,[smacks his forehead], It's SpongeBob. Is Gary all right?
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah. He's- ,[gets caught again from the upstairs water],
,SpongeBob:, ,[worried], He's what? He's what, Patrick? Gary is what?! ,[hears Gary and Patrick both laughing], What is happening to them?! ,[Patrick and Gary both laugh again after coming up from water], They need my help! ,[rushes back to the kitchen, where Grandma is still trying to blow all of the candles out], Grandma! Grandma!
,Grandma:, Hold on, dear. ,[pants], Just...just let me finish these last few candles. ,[again takes a deep breath and continues blowing, when all of a sudden, SpongeBob turns on a fan on top of them to blow all of the candles out, then Grandma sighs], I did it! ,[puts her hand on her forehead], Oh, but oh, am I tired!
,SpongeBob:, ,[as he carries Grandma to her bed], Ooh, better get you to bed now. Good night, Grandma! ,[in the background, he close the door],
,Grandma:, What a good boy!
,SpongeBob:, ,[running outside], Hang on, Gary! ,[when SpongeBob arrives at his house and opens the door, water comes out, and SpongeBob swims inside, then the water drains out], Gary! ,[hears Gary meow], What's the matter, buddy? ,[runs up the stairs, the sees Gary meowing at the book, ""Snail Tales"" while Patrick is laying on' SpongeBob's bed], Ahh... reading Patrick a bedtime story, I see. ""Snail Tales,"" that's a good one.
,Patrick:, ,[sits up on the bed], ""Snail Tales""? I thought it was called, ""Meow, meow, meow.""

"Patrick:, Okay, SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick! Here I come! ,[runs and leaps over Patrick],
,Patrick:, Nice landing! ,[rolls, leaps and lands on his head and hands], Darn, I missed! SpongeBob, look out for my body! ,[They both fall off a mountain and land on a nest.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking.
,Patrick:, Okay.
,SpongeBob:, Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!
,Patrick:, Ball! Let me see it! ,[a ball turns itself into a worm], What a weird ball.
,SpongeBob:, Well, who knows how long it ... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!
,Patrick:, There's nothing to be afraid of, SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest little worm. I promise it won't happen again. ,[the worm rubs its head on SpongeBob's hand], Look, Patrick!
,Patrick:, Looks like he's taking a fancy to you.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back.
,Patrick:, That sounds delightful! ,[cuts to scene where SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at SpongeBob's place.],
,SpongeBob:, Gary! ,[knocks the door], Make yourself descent. ,[laughs], You have a visitor. ,[Gary went to sleep, then wakes up.], Gary, wake up ,[opens the door, whispered], Patrick, just bring in here, careful now, that's right.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley. ,[shows Mr. Wormsely, then Gary hissed at him and Mr. Wormsley barks at him, they start to growl at each other.],
,Patrick:, Something tells me they don't like each other.
,SpongeBob:, Come on, now. Guys, come on. Let's touch soft parts in a friendly manner. See? You're just saying hi. That's it. There you go, that's it. Oh, I knew you could get along. There, there you go. See? Friends. ,[Gary attacks SpongeBob.], OW! Oh my goodness! Patrick, please do something. Aaaaaaaaaahhh.......
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Patrick, see you later then. ,[SpongeBob trips at Mr. Wormsely.], Aaaaaaaahhhh......
,[Cut to the scene tonight],
,SpongeBob:, All right, Gary, so there isn't more upset, you're going to sleep at the guest newspaper tonight, while Mr. Wormsley is sleeping here with me. ,[Gary growls at Mr. Wormsely. SpongeBob picks him up.], Now, now, Gary don't be rude. ,[SpongeBob opens the door. And turns on the lights.], See? I set it all nice just for you. There you are. ,[SpongeBob leaves.], Good night, Gary. ,[SpongeBob closes the door.],
,Gary:, Meow
,[Cut to the scene next morning.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob is seen sleeping. Waking up because of some howling.], Must have been Patrick is doing his night fits again. Okay I'll just close the window. ,[Still hears some howling.], Mr. Wormsley! ,[SpongeBob takes off the newspaper revealing him mourning, and a big belly, meaning he's giving birth.], Woaaaaahh! I'll be right back, Mr. Wormsley. I'm gonna go get help. Whatever's wrong with you, don't move!
,[Cut to the scene later with Patrick.],
,SpongeBob:, He's in here. ,[Patrick enters the door.], Oh! I can't watch!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, something tells me that Mr. Wormsley is actually a ,Mrs., Wormsley. ,[shows baby worms],
,SpongeBob:, Oh! Patrick, it’s a miracle.
,Patrick:, That it is.
,SpongeBob:, Wait 'till Gary sees.
,Patrick:, Yeah! Wait 'till.
,SpongeBob:, Here, Gary, right in here. They're gone asleep.
,[Mrs. Wormley and Gary are growling each other again. Gary and Mrs. Wormsley fighting. Until outside of conch street.],
,Gary:, Meow, Meow, Meow.
,[Mrs. Wormsley is now riding a bus.],
,SpongeBob:, He's chased her away! Now, who will care for her abandoned newborn infants?
,Patrick:, Maybe you could take care of them.
,SpongeBob:, I dunno, Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset. I guess we'll just have to find homes for each and every one of them. Right, Pat? Patrick? ,[Patrick is gone],
,[cuts to SpongeBob at Squidward's house],
,Squidward:, ,[opens door, yawning], SpongeBob? Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?
,SpongeBob:, How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?
,Squidward:, Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the—huh?
,SpongeBob:, Baby worms.
,Squidward:, ,[glances into the box holding the worms] [one oozes green glistening slime on Squidward's face],
,SpongeBob:, So, how many did you want? ,[Squidward shuts the door in SpongeBob's face], ,[cuts to Mrs Puff's house],
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes? Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. What are you, uh, doing here? And not that the teacher's most enthusiastic student isn't welcome in her house. ,[notices SpongeBob still ringing the doorbell and sighs. SpongeBob looks down at the ground and finally lets go of the doorbell.],
,SpongeBob:, Good morning, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, It almost was.
,SpongeBob:, Would you like a baby worm?
,Mrs. Puff:, A what? ,[screams. Inflates her body to break some of her house in pieces],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[house collapses], I hate Mondays.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you. ,[cuts to supermarket], Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some... ,[lady just keeps walking], Ma'am? ,[Larry comes out of the Supermarket whistling], That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to?
,Larry:, Do I know you?
,SpongeBob:, Probably not.
,Larry:, I was just picking up some dietary supplements here at the supermarket. I've been working on my chest... and buns.
,SpongeBob:, So I see.
,Larry:, Well, catch you later.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Larry, wait.
,Larry:, No time now. Somewhere, there's sand that needs kicking.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms.
,Larry:, Baby worms?
,SpongeBob:, Well, yeah!
,Larry:, I'll take them off your hands.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Larry:, Sure, why not? That's just what the nutritionist ordered: raw protein! ,[is about to eat the worms],
,SpongeBob:, Larry, no! ,[jumps into Larry's stomach, knocking him down and sending the box flying],
,Larry:, Dude, nice hustle.
,[The box lands in the middle of an intersection, with an 18-wheeler headed straight for it. SpongeBob lets out a bloodcurdling scream, flails his arms and babbles incoherently. Larry launches SpongeBob into the air with his abs and he lands on the hood of the truck. He slides down, pulls the vent apart, and crawls inside. He pulls out three plugs, then peeks outside. The truck is still going. Then he notices a loose screw. He unscrews it completely with a wrench, causing the engine to fall out of the bottom of the truck and the truck to stop completely, in the nick of time.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised. ,[the phone rings], Hello?
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work! ,[SpongeBob screams], Hello?
,SpongeBob:, ,[runs into the Krusty Krab out of breath], I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could--
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?
,SpongeBob:, ,[pants], I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live.
,Mr. Krabs:, Babies?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Mr. Krabs:, Let me see.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies.
,SpongeBob:, Well, okay.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in baby talk], Hey there, little critters. ,[looks inside the box], Come to... ,[one of the worms spits green bile onto his face],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he likes you.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[very angry], Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto! ,[SpongeBob is shocked by this reaction, and runs out of the Krusty Krab sobbing], Blech! ,[bubble transition to the back of the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, ,[inside a garbage can with the worms, depressed], Oh, well. At least I still have you guys. ,[gets sprayed on by the worms as a garbage truck drives up and stops],
,Garbage Fish #1:, Hmm... ,[removes some goo from SpongeBob's face with two fingers and sniffs it],
,Garbage Fish #2:, What is it?
,Garbage Fish #1:, I'd recognize this goo anywhere. It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species.
,Garbage Fish #2:, Dude, those things are worth a fortune.
,Mr. Krabs:, Did you say ""fortune?"" ,[His eyes show dollar symbols], ,[later, Mr. Krabs is talking through a megaphone and trying to sell worms], $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks.
,Female fish:, These things are so cute! ,[hands some money to Mr. Krabs and receives back a worm],
,SpongeBob:, Enjoy your new home, little guy.
,Female fish:, Isn't he just adorable? ,[gets sprayed on by her new baby worm. She laughs, the crowd cheers],
,SpongeBob:, That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad.
,SpongeBob:, What's that?
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't know. I've never been to the old country! ,[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both laugh, ending the episode],

,Squidward:, You're better off not knowing.
,SpongeBob:, ...boop, boop, boop! ,[Flips over and puts a tray on a customer's table], Your Krabby Patty, sir.
,Harold:, Do you always serve your food this way?
,SpongeBob:, You mean with a smile? Yes, sir! ,[Patrick walks in on a pretend horse],
,Patrick:, Beware! Let it be known to all far and wide, The mollusks are coming! Tally, ho! ,[Rides around the Krusty Krab], The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!
,SpongeBob:, Not the mollusks!
,Patrick:, Mollusks? What mollusks?
,SpongeBob:, There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick?
,Patrick:, No. I was only pretending to be my famous, Great-Great-Great Uncle, Patrick Revere! He rode through the streets warning Bikini Bottom of the coming hordes of ravenous, man-eating mollusks! ,[A flashback begins with Patrick's Great-Great uncle riding through town],
,Patrick Revere:, The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!
,Patrick:, It's too bad nobody listened to him.
,Fish #2:, What beeth the deal with ye olde nutcase? ,[Mollusks come in. Fish #2 and #3 scream. Flashback ends],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative.
,Patrick:, Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The spendthrift billfold system! Allow me to demonstrate. ,[Pulls out what looks like a dollar in a wallet], Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?
,SpongeBob:, Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, A-a-a watch. ,[Pulls on the dollar, a steel jaw trap grabs Mr. Krabs' finger], See?
,SpongeBob:, Doesn't that hurt?
,Mr. Krabs:, Every time!
,SpongeBob:, Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family.
,Patrick:, Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell. ,[Scene cuts to when SpongeBob is standing by a statue that looks like someone riding a seahorse, covered in jellyfish poop],
,SpongeBob:, I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor. ,[sighs], I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out. ,[Sandy jumps in],
,Sandy:, HI-YAH!
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Sandy. ,[Sandy sees SpongeBob upset],
,Sandy:, Something wrong, SpongeBob? You look sadder than a bullfrog full of sody-pop.
,SpongeBob:, Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?
,Sandy:, I sure do! My great aunt Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil. At Spindletop, Texas. ,[Flashback begins with a squirrel standing on top of an oil tower],
,Voice:, She's ready to blow! ,[Oil spurts out of the ground, the squirrel jumps away, flashback ends],
,SpongeBob:, Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me.
,Sandy:, Come on, I'll bet y'all got someone famous in your family tree.
,SpongeBob:, Well, there was my uncle Sherm. ,[Pulls out a wallet full of pictures], He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose. ,[Shows a picture of Uncle Sherm with a watermelon in his nose],
,Sandy:, That's not the kind of famous I mean. Come on. Lets do a little digging around your family tree. ,[Cut to Bikini Bottom Library, Sandy pulls out a book],
,Sandy:, ""Family Histories of Bikini Bottom"". Let's see, SquareHead, SquareShirt, SquarePants, Hey, looky here! ,[Points to a statue of SpongeBuck in a picture],
,SpongeBob:, Gasp!
,Sandy:, It's a statue of SpongeBuck SquarePants!
,SpongeBob:, I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?
,Sandy:, Says here he saved the entire town of Dead Eye Gulch, that's what Bikini Bottom was known as back in the old west days. ,[Story Begins, train coming into scene], It was a town that lived under the tyranny of a nasty crook 'til a mysterious stranger came to town. ,[Train stops, SpongeBuck gets off],
,SpongeBuck:, Wow! The big city! Well, time to make my fortune.
,Sandy:, Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good galoot, Dead Eye!
,SpongeBuck:, Shoo-Wee! This place sure is big and fancy-like! Gee, willigers! They got an ice cream parlor! ,[Sees a building that says ""Dead Eye Funeral Parlor and Ice Cream Parlor"", SpongeBuck walks up to the front], I'll take one scoop of vanilly ice cream, please.
,Fish #4:, You're new here, aren't you?
,SpongeBuck:, Yep. I just got off from the train.
,Fish #4:, You don't say. ,[Licks ice cream, Fish #4 measures SpongeBuck and makes a coffin for him, SpongeBuck notices that some people are looking at him, he looks at them, pull their hats down, keeps walking and licking, music is coming from the Krusty Kantina],
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Business is good today! ,[SpongeBuck walks in, wearing a bell that is ringing, everyone stops],

,Fish #5:, Yeah. Some fancy dude just sat in it. ,[SpongeBuck looks at the stool and smiles],
,Hopalong:, What can I get you, stranger?
,SpongeBuck:, Give me a shot of milk.
,Hopalong:, Milk?
,SpongeBuck:, Two percent.
,Hopalong:, Think you can handle it?
,SpongeBuck:, I drink this stuff every day. Over the lips and through the gums, look out tapeworm, here it comes! Get ready Tapey. ,[Laughs and drinks the milk, milk spills into a place where a worm is living], Aah, ,[Falls off the stool], Oh, yeah! Smooth.
,Hopalong:, Right.
,Western Mr. Krabs:, What brings you to Dead Eye Gulch, stranger?
,Hopalong:, Strange is right.
,SpongeBuck:, The name's SpongeBuck. I left home to make my way here in the big city. I'm here for the job. ,[Holds up a paper that says 'Sheriff Wanted'],
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Wonderful! You're hired. ,[Gives him a badge], Hey everybody! Meet our new sheriff! ,[Everyone cheers],
,SpongeBuck:, Sheriff? I'm not here for the sheriff job. I'm here for the fry cook job. ,[Holds up the same paper but points to an ad that says 'Fry cook wanted Low pay/No Benefits'], Back home, I'm known for my rootin-tootin, never-pootin chili. The spiciest chili west of the old west farm. ,[Krabs tries it and spits it out],
,Western Mr. Krabs:, No offense, kid. But your chili tastes terrible.
,SpongeBuck:, In a good way?
,Western Mr. Krabs:, No, in a terrible way. Look, we already gave you the badge. And the law of the west says: no take backs!
,Hopalong:, Since when?
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Shshshshshsh! So that means, you're the new sheriff!
,SpongeBuck:, What happened to the old sheriff?
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Uh, he's at Boot Hill. ,[Shows a picture of a cemetery with a sign saying Boot Hill],
,SpongeBuck:, Gasp! And, why is he at boot hill?
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Because Old Dead Tree Hill was totally full. ,[Shows a picture of a full cemetery with a sign saying Old Dead Tree Hill, Pecos Patrick bursts in],

,Dead Eye Plankton:, Well, what are you looking at?! ,[Everyone hides, Dead Eye knocks a chair with a person down, pulls off Pecos Patrick's clothes],
,Pecos Patrick:, Aw, again? ,[Dead Eye flings checkers pieces in the air and flings them at the milk glasses with his whip, Hopalong and Krabs duck],
,Dead Eye Plankton:, Get up you two! I'm here for my... money, Krabs ,[dips a coin in milk and bites on it], .
,Western Mr. Krabs:, ,[Laughs nervously], What? How am I supposed to keep the deed to me saloon if you keep taking all me mortgage payments? I'm going broke, here! ,[Dead Eye bends the coin],
,Dead Eye Plankton:, That's the idea! ,[Laughs], I thought we were all clear on that.
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yeah. ,[Hands Dead Eye a bag of money],
,Dead Eye Plankton:, I'll be back at high noon tomorrow for the deed!
,SpongeBuck:, Hey! That's not your money!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, WHO SAID THAT?! ,[Krabs points at SpongeBuck, Everyone runs away], Well, last time I checked, this town was Dead Eye Gulch! Not Yokelburg! ,[Laughs], Yokelburg... ,[Laughs again], Who are you anyway?
,SpongeBuck:, I'm SpongeBuck, the new sheriff. Want some chili?
,Dead Eye Plankton:, Sheriff! ,[Knocks down SpongeBuck's chili], 'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys!
,SpongeBuck:, Coffin jockeys!? ,[Runs over to Krabs], You didn't say anything about that!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, ,[Pulls out a pocket watch], That must be a new record for running off a sheriff.
,SpongeBuck:, ,[Is pretending to ride a horse, but is on a coffin], Hope I haven't missed the first post. Whoa, girl! ,[Coffin neighs like a horse],
,Dead Eye Plankton:, Where do you get these guys? ,[Krabs shrugs], All right, kid. I'm going to make it simple for you. I'm a villain, got it?
,SpongeBuck:, Uh huh.
,Dead Eye Plankton:, And this town ain't big enough for the both of us! Understand?
,SpongeBuck:, Yep.
,Dead Eye Plankton:, So, vamoose! Or we're going to have to settle this western-style at high noon, savvy?
,SpongeBuck:, Sounds great!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, You have no idea what I'm talking about?
,SpongeBuck:, Nope.
,Dead Eye Plankton:, (sighs) ,[Cracks whip at SpongeBuck, SpongeBuck runs away], And stay out! Hey, only three seconds off my record! ,[Everyone is looking at Dead Eye], What are you hayseeds looking at? ,[cracks whip, Everyone screams and runs away], Get out of here!
,Fish #6:, What's gonna happen to the town now, Pa?
,Fish #7:, I ain't your pa. ,[Both scream and run away],
,Dead Eye Plankton:, I love this town! ,[Laughs evilly. Cuts to the desert where SpongeBuck is riding the coffin like a horse],
,SpongeBuck:, Whoa, gal, whoa! Whoa! ,[Trips on a rock], Looks like the end of the trail. We're out of food, ,[shows his arm, with no hand], water, and lip balm! ,[Lip balm turns to dust, SpongeBuck's lips crack and break off], I'm sorry, old Paint! Guess I have to put you out your misery! So long, old friend! ,[Is about to saw coffin in half],
,Cowbone #1:, Hey, buddy, you better be careful. Heat does funny things to your head.
,SpongeBuck:, It does?
,Cowbone #2:, Oh, don't listen to that guy, kid! He's looney! ,[Both laugh, SpongeBuck laughs, Pecos Patrick laughs],
,Pecos Patrick:, Oh, hey SpongeBuck! Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh? But lazy! Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff!
,SpongeBuck:, I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! I'm nothing. ,[Pecos Patrick slaps him],
,Pecos Patrick:, Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me! ,[Shows a badly drawn picture of Pecos Patrick], Duhhh... 
,SpongeBuck:, I don't know, ,[slaps him again], Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurtin' me! Besides, you're right! It's time I stepped up and looked him in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon!
,Pecos Patrick:, Hop on, buddy!
,SpongeBuck:, Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon.
,Pecos Patrick:, Don't worry. I got a short-cut. He-ya! ,[Starts riding coffin, rides over a cliff, both land on a cactus, both start flying toward Dead Eye Gulch, in Dead Eye Gulch, a carriage is riding around town],
,Polene Puff:, Why are we going so fast?
,Western Mr. Krabs:, 'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs! ,[Dead Eye is in the road],
,Dead Eye Plankton:, ,[Laughs evilly], Great idea! ,[Scene cuts to where Western Mr. Krabs, Polene Puff, and Hopalong have no clothes on but their underclothes], Okay, let's see, ,[checking off a list], personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa!
,Hopalong:, I gotta admit, he's got skills.
,Dead Eye Plankton:, That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon, Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives! ,[laughs, but then coughs], Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-how! ,[Rides off],
,Western Mr. Krabs:, So, that's it.
,Polene Puff:, We lost.
,Hopalong:, I don't know how it could get any worse. ,[SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick start falling],
,SpongeBuck:, Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time!
,Pecos Patrick:, We're heroes!
,Hopalong:, You're morons!
,Polene Puff:, It's too late. Plankton's taken everything!
,SpongeBuck:, But it's only 11:55. The final showdown always takes place at high noon.
,Polene Puff:, Well, I guess the early bird gets the worm.
,Hopalong:, And all our stuff.
,Western Mr. Krabs:, And me money! Me beautiful, beautiful money!
,SpongeBuck:, You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch.
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Could you get to the point? We're freezing!
,SpongeBuck:, What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say?
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Well, I think we all know the answer.
,All:, Forget it, SpongeBuck!
,Pecos Patrick:, Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! Pillow fight! ,[Whacks Hopalong with his pillow, laughs, then whacks SpongeBuck],
,SpongeBuck:, That pillow sure packs a wallop!
,Pecos Patrick:, It's made out of wood, ,[Pulls out a wooden log inside the pillow], like all pillows in the old west. Round 2?
,SpongeBuck:, I do believe I'd sit this one out.
,Pecos Patrick:, Looks like it's just you and me, kid. ,[Whacks himself with the log],
,SpongeBuck:, Come on, guys! We can do this! If we work together!
,Western Mr. Krabs:, No offense, kid. But your advice is as terrible as your chili.
,SpongeBuck:, I don't blame you for losing faith. I lost faith too. But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend. And we've come far. So I'm sure with all of us working together, in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town! So let's huddle up and make a plan, together! Bzbzbzbzbzb
,Pecos Patrick:, Uh huh,
,SpongeBuck:, Bzbzbzbzbzbzb
,Pecos Patrick:, Uh huh, uh huh,
,SpongeBuck:, Bzbzbzbzbzbzbzbzb
,Hopalong:, Uh, SpongeBuck, why do you keep saying bzbzbzbzbzbzb?
,SpongeBuck:, Umm...
,Hopalong:, You don't have a plan, do you?
,SpongeBuck:, No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far. ,[Everyone groans], But I know we can beat him! If we just work together!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, Oh, I am terrified.
,All:, Dead Eye Plankton?!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, So, fry cook, you're back! And all alone.
,SpongeBuck:, You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right g-- Hey! ,[All of SpongeBuck's friends are hiding at the Krusty Kantina],
,Western Mr. Krabs:, We're right behind you, boy! WAY, WAY behind you!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, So, it's come to this. Mano y mano.
,SpongeBuck:, Well, you can hold the ,mano,, because it's come down to you and me!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, Well, well, well, look at the time! High noon! ,[A clock strikes 12:00 P.M., Dead Eye and SpongeBuck walk toward each other. SpongeBuck suddenly hears a squelching sound.], Ow! ,[SpongeBuck, confused, lifts his shoe, and underneath is Dead Eye, squished and sticking to his shoe. Everyone who's hiding looks at SpongeBuck, and they come out and cheers], I hate all of you!
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Can I try?
,Dead Eye Plankton:, You can't do this! ,[Western Mr. Krabs joyfully steps on Dead Eye repeatedly],
,Pecos Patrick:, Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck!
,Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch:, Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! ,[scene cuts to where Krabs is holding a line to squash Dead Eye at the Krusty Kantina],
,Mr. Krabs:, Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, ,[Polene Puff is smushing Dead Eye over and over again. The bottom of her shoe is covered in green stains], Ah! Ouch! Ooh!
,Polene Puff:, Take that, you no-good little varmint!
,Dead Eye Plankton:, I have a lot of money! ,[Gets smashed by her boot again, and she twists her foot, smearing him into the floor],
,Pecos Patrick:, Well, sheriff, you beat Dead Eye Plankton and saved the town. ,[SpongeBuck drinks a glass of milk, but Pecos Patrick spills his, both say Ahh],
,SpongeBuck:, You forgot the most important part. I discovered the power of idiot friendship. ,[Shows a badly drawn picture of them both going Duhhh...],
,Pecos Patrick:, Come with me, I want to show you something.
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Thank you, sheriff SpongeBuck for saving our town. And for stepping on that little varmint.
,Dead Eye Plankton:, History will vindicate me! ,[Gets stepped on by Pecos Patrick],
,Western Mr. Krabs:, We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor. ,[Pulls off a sheet revealing a golden statue of SpongeBuck on a coffin],
,Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch:, Oooh!
,Hopalong:, I liked my design better. ,[Shows a piece of paper with his idea on it, but it is him],
,Western Mr. Krabs:, Sorry about the whole “tricking you into being sheriff” thing. And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you. If you'll take it. ,[Puts the badge on SpongeBuck],
,SpongeBuck:, Wow! Fry cook! ,[Everyone starts clapping], Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey! I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!'
,Citizens of Bikini Gulch:, Aaw!
,Fish #8:, Say seaweed! ,[Picture takes, story ends],
,SpongeBob:, So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. ,[Sandy and SpongeBob walk out of the library], It was much better than that one we have now. ,[Both walk by the statue SpongeBob saw earlier],
,Sandy:, Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop.
,SpongeBob:, Wait a minute, ,[Goes over and starts to pick at the jellyfish poop],
,Sandy:, Gross! Don't touch that, SpongeBob! Eeew! What are you doing?! ,[SpongeBob wipes the poop off the statue to reveal gold], That boy ain't hooked up right.
,SpongeBob:, Look, Sandy!
,Sandy:, HUH? ,[The statue reveals to be the SpongeBuck statue],
,SpongeBob:, SpongeBuck was here all along! Sorry, Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop.
,Sandy:, Wow!
,SpongeBob:, I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!
,Sandy:, Keep dreaming, SpongeBob. Keep dreaming. ,[The jellyfish float back to the golden statue. Scene cuts to the Krusty Kantina where SpongeBuck is on stage],
,SpongeBuck:, Hey, everybody! It's good to be here at the Krusty Kantina! We got a real special show for y'all tonight! Featuring my new best pal, this guy! ,[Pecos Patrick gets on stage,], He's an idiot! ,[Everyone cheers],
,Pecos Patrick:, So, what are we gonna sing about, SpongeBuck?
,SpongeBuck:, We're gonna sing a song about friends!
,Pecos Patrick:, What kind of friends, SpongeBuck?
,SpongeBuck:, Well, listen up and I'll tell you! ♪Who's there for you when you are sad and down?♪
,Buffalo Skulls:, ♪Idiot Friends!♪
,Pecos Patrick:, ♪Who picks you up and slaps you all around?♪

"[One morning at SpongeBob's pineapple, SpongeBob looks out the window, then goes out in the hallway. He yawns and sticks his tongue out. Then he comes out wearing a pair of goggles over his eyes rather than his usual pair of glasses to go jellyfishing. He clears his throat],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, All ready to go jellyfishing today?
,Patrick:, No. Just kidding!
,[SpongeBob laughs. Patrick shows a net with two scoops],
,SpongeBob:, I see you even brought your double net.
,Patrick:, Yep. It's three times as fun.
,SpongeBob:, Um, Patrick? Don't you mean twice as fun?
,Patrick:, What is?
,SpongeBob:, Your— never mind.
,Patrick:, Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me. We should probably check the weather report before we go.
,SpongeBob:, Good idea.
,[Cuts back to the pineapple where Patrick and SpongeBob are watching the weather report on TV],
,Phil:, And now the weather.
,SpongeBob:, Here we go.
,Phil Preflumster:, Thank you, Phil. Today's weather forecast calls for— ,[a piece of paper is given], A horrible storm will ravage the Bikini Bottom area.
,Patrick and SpongeBob:, A horrible storm?
,Phil Preflumster:, You heard me. Panic is not advised although it is recommended. Also, an advisory has been issued to avoid any and all jellyfishing if possible.
,[TV turns off, SpongeBob now stands in front of his living room window with some boards in his hands],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating.
,SpongeBob:, Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it.
,[He goes up to his big bass on the wall to show Patrick what he is talking about.],
,Patrick:, Hmm.
,SpongeBob:, Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather.
,Patrick:, You can say that again.
,SpongeBob:, Actually, I can't.
,Patrick:, Why?
,SpongeBob:, Because I just stepped on one of these nails.
,[shows a picture of SpongeBob's shoe with a nail sticking out. Cut to Squidward's house humming and tweezing his eyebrows],
,Squidward:, Laa da dee, laa da da, laa da doo. Got ya. Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and—
,[cut back to SpongeBob's where Patrick angrily nails a hammer causing a racket at Squidward's],
,Squidward:, ,[screams],
,[He falls and bumps his head on his toilet, and it looks like his eyebrows are bleeding, because he tweezed his skin off his eyebrow. He looks and gets angry],
,Squidward:, Grr!
,[Then we are back to SpongeBob's pineapple where SpongeBob and Patrick are hammering his door],
,Patrick:, Violin.
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us.
,[Squidward angrily knocks down SpongeBob's door],
,Patrick:, I guess Squidward's not part of nature.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us?
,Squidward:, No! I— what storm?
,SpongeBob:, The one Preflumster told us about.
,Squidward:, Who's that?
,Patrick:, He's the weatherman on the news channel. He said—
,Squidward:, I can't understand a word you're saying.
,SpongeBob:, C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea...
,Patrick:, I thought it was cocoa!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking.
,Patrick:, That's better.
,Squidward:, Well, I think I'll pass.
,SpongeBob:, Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?
,Squidward:, Hmm, I'll have to think about that.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my—
,[Squidward starts to leave when a bolt of lightning strikes. Squidward comes back burnt from the lightning strike],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers.
,[another bolt of lightning strikes, and now we see Candles lit],
,SpongeBob:, That's better.
,Squidward:, What's better about it? I liked it better before, when I could see!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, the lights went out.
,Squidward:, Yes, they did, when you turned them off!
,[Patrick spits out his cocoa],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! What is it?
,Patrick:, I never realized how delicious your hot cocoa is.
,SpongeBob:, Thank you, Patrick.
,Squidward:, Oh, boy. How about some of those games you promised?
,[yet another bolt of lightning strikes. The lightning causes impact on SpongeBob's pineapple leaves. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward get ready to play tic-tac-toe],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first.
,Squidward:, This is tic-tac-toe. You don't roll to see who goes first.
,Patrick:, He's right. You play rock, paper, scissors for it.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah.
,[shot of the exterior of the pineapple again. Then Patrick holds up a ""paper"" hand, Squidward also holds up a ""paper"" hand, and SpongeBob also holds up a ""paper"" hand],
,Patrick:, One.
,SpongeBob:, Two.
,Squidward:, Three!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it's a tie.
,Patrick:, Darn it!
,Patrick, SpongeBob, Squidward:, One, two, three.
,Patrick:, Darn it! I'll get you next time.
,Squidward:, One, two, three.
,SpongeBob:, Tie.
,Patrick:, Darn it!
,Squidward:, One, two, three.
,SpongeBob:, Tie.
,Patrick:, Darn it!
,[another shot of the pineapple then cut to Squidward with a tic-tac-toe board already made crossed off the X's],
,Squidward:, There, I win. See?
,[then we see SpongeBob and Patrick thinking. the clothes that Patrick is wearing is a bow, and SpongeBob is wearing a visor with reading glasses],
,Patrick:, I'm not seeing anything there.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk.
,Squidward:, What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!
,Patrick:, Easy, friend.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun.
,[he takes out a rulebook for tic-tac-toe and flips through pages],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick clap],
,Patrick:, Well played.
,[Squidward looks as if he's about to cry. Yet another shot of the pineapple],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Patrick. You can do it.
,[Patrick groans],
,SpongeBob:, Be the puzzle piece.
,Patrick:, Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second. ,[as Patrick turns into an old man, and then a fart noise],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you.

,Squidward:, Grrr!

,Squidward:, I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just—
,SpongeBob:, Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!
,Patrick:, Who's the green guy?
,Squidward:, It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.
,Squidward:, Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over.
,[SpongeBob jumbles the pieces, Squidward mumbles],
,Squidward:, I've got to get out of here!
,[yet another lightning bolt strikes Squidward he comes back burnt again],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—
,Squidward:, No, I can't.
,SpongeBob:, Please, Squidward?
,Squidward:, No way.
,SpongeBob:, Please...
,Squidward:, I have an even better idea.
,SpongeBob:, What is it?
,Patrick:, Tell us.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!
,Squidward:, Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called ""boundaries.""
,Patrick:, Ooh-ooh-ooh!
,Squidward:, Yes, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Will there be any spelling in this game?
,Squidward:, Oh, no, no spelling.
,Patrick:, Yes!
,Squidward:, It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor.
,SpongeBob:, I have a question.
,Squidward:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Where are you going to get the chalk?
,Squidward:, I brought some!
,[yet another flash of lightning. An organ plays an ominous tune as Squidward goes up to SpongeBob's room. He draws the chalk line at the top of the stairs then tosses the chalk to SpongeBob and Patrick. Then, Squidward slams SpongeBob's bedroom door],
,Squidward:, Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over. ,[his stomach starts growling], Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot. ,[he starts eating snail food. Gary meows], I bet you wish you had some of this, don't—? Snail food? ,[he spits the food out], I've got to get some real food. ,[SpongeBob is now dressed as a security guard],
,SpongeBob:, Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.
,Squidward:, I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross.
,SpongeBob:, If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers.
,Squidward:, Identific—? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the— what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll—
,SpongeBob:, Hmm. You may be telling the truth.
,Squidward:, Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry.
,SpongeBob:, But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth.
,Squidward:, That'll be the day.
,[Squidward runs downstairs, SpongeBob blows his whistle. Squidward makes it towards the kitchen, and start taking food from SpongeBob's refrigerator],
,SpongeBob:, Stop that cephalopod!
,[he jumps out of his security guard costume leaving on his underwear, and jumps on Squidward's back],
,Squidward:, Please. I just want to get back... onto my side of boundary.
,SpongeBob:, This, I cannot allow. It is against the rules.
,Squidward:, But all I wanted was something to eat.
,Patrick:, Did somebody say something to eat?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, look out!
,Squidward:, Whoa! ,[screams],
,[SpongeBob and Squidward run into Patrick leaving food everywhere],
,Squidward:, My food!
,SpongeBob:, Your food?
,Patrick:, Hey, I want some too.
,[they run around in circles screaming and acting like cavemen. SpongeBob takes a piece of bread. Patrick takes a can and chews on it. Squidward runs past him and Patrick protects his can. Squidward has a hamburger but SpongeBob takes it. SpongeBob and Squidward pull but the hamburger sticks to the wall],
,Squidward:, Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?
,SpongeBob:, Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways.
,Squidward:, Did you hear that?
,SpongeBob:, It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.
,Squidward:, No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside.
,SpongeBob:, I don't hear anything.
,Squidward:, The storm must've stopped.
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, wait!
,Squidward:, Woooo-hoooo! So long, suckers! ,[screams],

,Mr. Krabs:, Finest under the sea!
,Dave:, Yeah, yeah, sure. But where's the pizzazz?
,Mr. Krabs:,  Huh?
,Dave:, Look at this place. ,[the inside of the Krusty Krab is all old and worn out], I mean, what is the theme here? Underwater? It's boring! ,[He turns and crawls away], Food! Water! Atmosphere!
,Mr. Krabs:, Nobody goes to a restaurant for atmosphere. ,[runs to the door], They go for food! ,[he looks out the door as Fred and Tom see each other on the street],
,Fred:, Hey, Tom!
,Tom:, Fred! Hey, you wanna eat at the Krusty Krab?
,Fred:, Nah, let's go to the Shell Shack. They've got a talking dog!
,Tom:, ,[runs off with Fred], Great! Say, what's a dog?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[Gasps], Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring people back in here!
,SpongeBob:, ,[peeks through Mr. Krabs' eye stalks], I have an idea! ,[Mr. Krabs' eye stalks pull back together, chopping SpongeBob in half],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait! I've got an idea! ,[Cut to outside the Krusty Krab, where a marching band plays, and a crowd gathers around Mr. Krabs], ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive! ,[Everyone cheers and confetti shoots up from the ground as Mr. Krabs wields a shovel. He digs a hole, and then hops into it], No free refills. ,[scene cuts. Then, he pats the dirt in around him, leaving himself underground with no trace of him. Fred runs up to on top of where Krabs was buried],
,Fred:, Hey, everyone, listen! ,[the music stops], The talking dog at the Shell Shack is singing! Come on!
,[He motions for everyone to follow, and they do, leaving Mr. Krabs alone, under the ground. Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab, where it has been cleaned out],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
,Mr. Krabs:, What am I going to do? If I don't find an idea, I'll go out of business!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
,Mr. Krabs:, Why can't someone give me an idea?
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[looks above], Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!
,[A divine light hits Krabs, and SpongeBob comes down, playing the harp and dressed like an angel],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sings], Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
,Mr. Krabs:, What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy? ,[grabs SpongeBob, removing the angel costume], Tell me!
,SpongeBob:, OK. Mr. Krabs, Prepare yourself. Don't bother sitting down, because you'll just stand up when you see this! ,[makes a ,Pretty Patty,], Ta-da! ,[Shows Mr. Krabs a green Krabby Patty],
,Mr. Krabs:, Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!
,[He knocks it off of the plate and onto the ground, where he burns it with a flame thrower. Once the fire is gone, SpongeBob appears in a fire-retardant suit],
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat ,[Fire once again overcomes him, and he emerges in regular clothing, with an artist's pallet in hand. On the palette, Krabby Patties lie in different colors], Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors.
,[short pause then Mr. Krabs laughs, and SpongeBob looks broken-heartedly at his own creation],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward! Come look!
,[Squidward walks up, smiling mockingly],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[jokingly], Don't that look appetizing?
,Squidward:, Mmm, mmm. Good, sir.
,[Both laughing],
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!
,[Squidward laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, What's next? ,[holds up a milkshake cup with sequins and encrusted into it], Sequin milkshakes?
,Squidward:, ,[holds up a French fry with a bow-tie on], Bow-tie French fries?
,SpongeBob:, ,[Welding with tears], No.
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs dance mockingly while chanting ""Pretty Patties""],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Crying], Stop it ,[SpongeBob becomes indignant], I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant! ,[He runs out of the Krusty Krab], You'll see!
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs look at each other, then they continue laughing. Cut to Conch Street],
,SpongeBob:, ,[angrily approaches an angry Patrick], Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too?
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, What's the matter?
,Patrick:, I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?
,SpongeBob:, I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so.
,Patrick:, ,[no longer angry, and a cord appears from his shorts], Me too. ,[he pulls the cord, causing his shorts to inflate and lift into the air a few feet. Patrick is floating upside-down], Inflatable pants! What's your idea?
,SpongeBob:, I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!
,Patrick:, ,[his shorts explode, leaving him with only a piece of his shorts covering his crotch], Forget my dumb idea, that's great!
,[Cut to later, where SpongeBob has constructed a purple stand that says ""Pretty Patties."" Patrick is behind a second one to the left of SpongeBob that is brown and says ""Pay Here""],
,SpongeBob:, Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick? ,[Patrick looks down and pulls up his purple-and-green trunks and gives SpongeBob the thumbs-up], Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open. ,[He puts up an ""Open"" sign. Cut to him at the stand], I'm ready! ,[He is an adult with the same camera angling. He has glasses on, and brown hair. His pineapple begins to rot], I'm ready. ,[He is an old man with a long, gray beard. His pineapple wilts and dies], I'm ready... ,[His gravestone behind the stand says ""R.I.P. I'M READY."" There is a vacant spot where his pineapple previously was. SpongeBob wakes up at the stand and sees that that was a dream], Patrick, how long have we been standing here?
,Patrick:, ,[looks at the sloppily-drawn crayon marks on his wrist made to look like a watch], Awww. I gotta draw a new battery for this. ,[scribbles on his wrist with a blue crayon],
,SpongeBob:, What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb. ,[cries],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, sometimes, we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.
,SpongeBob:, I'm scared.
,Patrick:, Then I'm going in for you! ,[climbs into SpongeBob's head through one of his pores. Then, SpongeBob inflates like a puffer fish],
,Patrick:, Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants! ,[flies out of SpongeBob and lands headfirst on the ground],
,SpongeBob:, Did you find anything?
,Patrick:, Huh?
,Harold:, ,[walks up to the stand], Hey, do you sell food here?
,[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle, making Harold feel awkward],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties! ,[holds out a green Pretty Patty],
,Harold:, That thing's green! ,[starts laughing hysterically], Green! ,[laughs some more],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs as well, but doesn't laugh hard at all], Green. ,[SpongeBob cries],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these? ,[holds out the palette of Pretty Patties],
,Harold:, ,[Stops laughing], Hey, is that one purple? Purple is my favorite color! ,[He tries it], This isn't half bad! Hey, world! ""Pretty Patties"" is the best idea ever! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are elated],
,[Cut to Mr. Krabs in his office, eating popcorn and watching a movie, crying. A spider dangling from its web cries as well],
,Rick's Wife:, ,[On TV], Oh, Rick, how could you? Together we were one.
,Rick:, ,[On TV], That was before. But now, I'm splitting us up.
,[Onscreen, an amoeba splits into two amoebas. All of a sudden, it turns to a Bikini Bottom News emergency broadcast. Johnny talks at a desk. Behind him is a bamboo screen showing a crowd of Bikini Bottom citizens cheering],
,Johnny:, We interrupt this program to bring you a special news announcement! This wild crowd behind me is screaming for Bikini Bottom's latest culinary sensation. Let's take a listen.
,All:, ,[Chanting], Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!
,Mr. Krabs:, Pretty Patties? ,[The spider comes down and steal Mr. Krabs' popcorn],
,Johnny:, It's easy to see Pretty Patties are popular, but what is it about them that drives Bikini Bottom feeders wild?
,Millie, Sadie ,[has hair],, and Evelyn:, They match our purses! ,[show their purses],
,Scottish Man:, ,[with Scottish accent, kilt, and bagpipe], They remind me of home. ,[holds up a plaid Pretty Patty],
,Larry:, ,[runs up], Pretty Patties rule! ,[flexes his muscles],
,Johnny:, Mr. SquarePants, how do you explain all this success?
,SpongeBob:, Uhhh... I don't know.
,Mr. Krabs:, How can you make money with such a stupid idea?
,Johnny:, ,[the TV background has money falling], And how can you not make money with such a brilliant idea?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it... ,[Mr. Krabs' eyestalks inflate], ...shredding it... ,[Krabs' eyestalks inflate some more], ...and burning it. ,[Mr. Krabs's eyestalks burst and fly around like a balloon with a hole in it as he screams], But in the end, we decided just to give it all away.
,[Patrick is at this stand that now has a bamboo ""$"" and says ""FREE MONEY."" He hands a filled paper sack to Nathiel],
,Patrick:, Come again, sir!
,Nathiel:, I'm getting back in line! ,[runs off],
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't believe it! ,[runs out of his office and across the dining area], I've got to see this for me self! ,[runs out the door and into Sandals],
,Sandals:, Hey Watch it, buddy. I don't care how much you want your Pretty Patty. You're gonna have to wait in line ,[shows Krabs the very long line], like the rest of us.
,Mr. Krabs:, I've never had a line.
,[At SpongeBob's stand, the ""Now Serving"" sign flips to 46,853],
,SpongeBob:, Who's #46,853?
,[An enormous amount of people surround them and they simultaneously declare themselves as #46,853. Mr. Krabs makes his way to the front of the line],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[surprised], I never had 46,853 customers.
,SpongeBob:, ,[hands a Pretty Patty to an anchovy], Here you are, sir. Stay pretty. ,[laughing], All right. ,[notices Mr. Krabs], Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs? ,[Mr. Krabs smiles nervously], The Pretty Patties are a big hit.
,Mr. Krabs:, They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.
,SpongeBob:, No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gets an idea, then he smiles smugly], I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? ,[demonstrates rubbing two pickles together], That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake. ,[takes SpongeBob by the hand and starts to walk away, but SpongeBob's arm expands and he just stays in the same place],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye. ,[SpongeBob retracts his arm],
,SpongeBob:, You will?
,Mr. Krabs:, No! I've got a better idea. I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands. For keeps. An in exchange, I'll give you the Krusty Krab. With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles.
,SpongeBob:, ,[In a trance], What did you say, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Here's the key to the Krusty Krab. ,[gives SpongeBob the key, which is composed of 2 K's and a ring], She's yours now.
,SpongeBob:, ,[receives the key, while still in a trance], Thank you. What should I do now, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya.
,SpongeBob:, I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it!, [grabs SpongeBob and tosses him to the crowd], Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!
,SpongeBob:, ,[while crowd-surfing, SpongeBob's surroundings turn into a pink sky with clouds], Dreams do come true. ,[gets thrown to the ground],
,[SpongeBob floats up and kisses the building. He cheers in the dining area, kiss the floor, throw buns up into the air in the kitchen, laugh over the phone in Mr. Krabs' office, and stand at the ordering boat, the whole Krusty Krab cleaned and refreshed. Cut back to the Pretty Patties stand],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ladies and gentlemen! ""Pretty Patties"" is now under new management! ,[holds a green Pretty Patty], Who's next? ,[the crowd cheers],
,[A sea-level shot of the Bikini Atoll Island. It turns from night to dawn. Cut to Mr. Krabs at the stand beside SpongeBob's house. The ""Free Money"" stand has been disassembled],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready...For me money. ,[the crowd gathers around him, all looking angry], Welcome to Pretty Patties. May I take your money?
,Franco:, ,[high-pitched voice], We want a refund, Krabs. ,[crowd yelling in agreement],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[confused and scared as he turns his head three times], Who, huh, What?
,Gus:, Your dumb Pretty Patties turned my ,[shows his purple face], face purple!
,Scottish Man:, ,[Scottish accent], Look what I got under my kilt! ,[raises his kilt to reveal a plaid body, and white underwear],
,Clay, John, and Frank:, And look at our tongues! ,[they show Mr. Krabs their respective tongues: a yellow tongue, a speckled tongue, and a normal-looking pink tongue],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[confused as he refers to Frank's tongue while sweating], What's wrong with you?
,Frank:, ,[turns off a light to reveal his tongue is glow-in-the-dark, and is pulsing green], We want our money back. All 46,853 of us. ,[turns the light back on, but Mr. Krabs is nowhere to be seen],
,Harold:, Hey, where did he go?
,[Cut to Mr. Krabs screaming and running away],
,Crowd:, Get him! ,[crowd yelling, chases Krabs, with a rainbow trailing behind them],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[panting...]"" Oof! ""[slams on the Krusty Krab door but it's locked], My key! ,[checks his pocket for the key but it's not there], Where's my key?! ,[recalls he gave it to SpongeBob], SpongeBob! ,[he quickly bangs the door to get SpongeBob's attention], SpongeBob, let me in! ,[inside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is too busy happily rubbing the two pickles together, making a squeaking sound], SpongeBob! SpongeBob! ,[Mr. Krabs tries to get SpongeBob's attention from outside], SpongeBob! Let me in! ,[SpongeBob cannot hear due to his pickle-squeaking. Krabs screams as he is chased left and right by the mob, still yelling for SpongeBob's attention. Crowd yelling], SpongeBob!

"[episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in Mr. Krabs' office, and all the lights are off],
,SpongeBob:, You wanted to see me, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, Pull up a seat, boy. ,[SpongeBob looks around],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Sit, down! ,[SpongeBob sits on the floor], Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy.
,SpongeBob:, Ooh, yes, sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, That sad fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of, the secret ingredient ,[Mr. Krabs hold up a bottle], to the secret formula! ,[Mr. Krabs holds up the formula],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], No!
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen up, boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and iIm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this with out any foulups! Understand?
,SpongeBob:, Could you repeat that? ,[Mr. Krabs looks at his watch],
,Mr. Krabs:, It's time! ,[Mr. Krabs presses a button, which makes a siren go off, and locks down the whole restaurant. A truck then arrives with S.W.A.T. team members to make a path from the restaurant to the truck], Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!
,SpongeBob:, I won't let you down.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait!
,SpongeBob:, Yes?
,Mr. Krabs:, If something happens to that secret ingredient, don't bother coming back to work! ,[SpongeBob gets scared, then walks outside, and up to the truck],
,S.W.A.T. Team Member 1:, You BobPants?
,SpongeBob:, Uh, SpongeBob.
,S.W.A.T. Team Member 1:, Close enough. ,[hands SpongeBob the case with the ingredient inside], Now get out of here, kid! Plenty of folks would love to get a hold of that ingredient.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir! ,[runs back to the Krusty Krab], And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patties, secret ingredienty. ,[notices that the secret ingredient is not there, and gasps], Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe? ,[notices a hole], What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! ,[he hides the case behind his back], What are you doing lolly gagging about?! Get back to work!
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], Right away, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hop to it! There's a lot of hungry customers out there!
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!
,Patrick:, ,[suddenly appears], Hi SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me.
,Patrick:, With what?
,SpongeBob:, With this. ,[shows him the case. Patrick puts some mustard on it, then puts it on buns],
,Patrick:, Here you go, buddy.
,SpongeBob:, Not that kind of help. This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!
,Patrick:, What?
,SpongeBob:, Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!
,Patrick:, Find out!
,SpongeBob:, You and I are going to need to do a little detective work! ,[cuts to the Chum Bucket],
,Plankton:, What are we eating this time, Karen?
,Karen:, ,[puts a Krabby Patty on the plate], Something new.
,Plankton:, Oh, you mean the ""secret recipe"" I came up with?
,SpongeBob:, Aha! I knew it was you!
,Plankton:, What was me?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!
,Plankton:, Is this a joke?
,SpongeBob:, Why don't you tell me. Is it?!
,Plankton:, Uh, no.
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], A good one!
,SpongeBob:, All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk! ,[Patrick holds up clackers, then bangs them together],
,Plankton:, Sorry, I really have nothing for you.
,SpongeBob:, Then how do you explain this? ,[picks up the Krabby Patty],
,Plankton:, Okay, you caught me.
,SpongeBob:, And so the truth floweth forth.
,Plankton:, Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.
,SpongeBob:, Mm-hmm.
,Plankton:, But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty. ,[both are confused], After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter of the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffs the patty], Yuck.
,Plankton:, Try it, tell me what you think. ,[they walk out of the Chum Bucket],
,SpongeBob:, Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?
,Patrick:, Good question.
,SpongeBob:, Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist. ,[cuts to Sandy's treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick sneak up at the treedome, then look around], There she is. ,[Sandy walks up to her table with a covered plate], You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look. ,[SpongeBob put's a water helmet on, then drills a hole into Sandy's treedome, then hides behind her tree. Sandy uncovers the plate, revealing Krabby Patties. SpongeBob gasps], Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy! ,[Sandy digs a hole, and buries the Krabby Patty in it], Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?
,Sandy:, SpongeBob! How long have you been standing there buddy?
,SpongeBob:, Oh long enough, ""buddy.""
,Sandy:, I was just storing food for the impending winter. Want one?
,SpongeBob:, I'm onto you, squirrel. ,[sniffs the patty], You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties.
,Sandy:, What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, What I am getting at, is that you... ,[screen cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining], ...cloaked yourself  an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter... ,[Sandy picks up one of the S.W.A.T. Team Member],
,S.W.A.T. Team Member 2:, What was that?
,S.W.A.T. Team Member 1:, Here's the secret Krabby Patty ingredient.
,SpongeBob:, ...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient, ,[cuts back to SpongeBob and Sandy], reverse engineered it, and made your own patties. So you wouldn't have to pay.
,Sandy:, Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them, ,[holds up a receipt], and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!
,SpongeBob:, ,[reads receipt], 283 Krabby Patties. ,[laughs nervously], That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility.
,Sandy:, SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!
,SpongeBob:, My own house, huh? ,[Cut to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick have Gary cornered against a wall, with a light above him], Why'd you do it, Gary?!
,Gary:, ,[frightened], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it! ,[scene cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining again], First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tearducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient. ,[cuts back to SpongeBob's house],
,Gary:, ,[angry], Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, What's that, Gary?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this, this marauder to the sketch artist.
,Gary:, Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
,Patrick:, I can't believe it! It was Squidward! ,[shows drawing of Squidward eating a Krabby Patty. Cuts to them in front of Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few... ,[to Patrick], Not cooperating.
,Patrick:, You know what to do. ,[SpongeBob picks up Patrick, and uses him as a batting ram],
,Squidward:, And one, and... ,[screams],
,SpongeBob:, Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.
,Patrick:, But we hear-ed what you've done.
,Squidward:, If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient! ,[scene cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining again], And we have an eye witness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case.
,Squidward:, A case like this? ,[hands SpongeBob a black suitcase],
,SpongeBob:, Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without... ,[both gasp], tap dancing shoes?
,Squidward:, That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.
,SpongeBob:, ,[nervously], I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient. ,[Squidward snatches the briefcase from SpongeBob and walks outside],
,Squidward:, Get out of my house! ,[Squidward picks up his house, then moves it away from them, then walks inside. Cuts to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!
,SpongeBob:, I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, do you have any leads, or clues?
,SpongeBob:, All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when they got it.
,Mr. Krabs:, That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!
,SpongeBob:, Me?!
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper. ,[cuts to what Mr. Krabs is explaining], You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket, ,[cuts back to the Krusty Krab], where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck. ,[SpongeBob tries to talk, but Mr. Krabs stops him], Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now! ,[policemen come out from hiding in a barrel],
,Policeman:, No need. We heard it all from this barrel.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[In a Russian accent], Then arrest this thief, Officer! ,[points at him with the secret ingredient],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[nervously],Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient. ,[sees he's still holding it out, then hides it],
,Policeman:, Am I to understand that you stole the item in question?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...
,Policeman:, And you were going to let someone else take the fall for this little caper?
,Mr. Krabs:, I can explain!
,Policeman:, Please do.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.
,Policeman:, I think Judge Trout will be very interested to hear this little story. ,[handcuffs him],
,Mr. Krabs:, What? What'd I do? ,[cuts to the court house],
,Judge:, All rise. Eugene Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Your honor.
,Judge:, As punishment for committing the crime of grand theft, I sentence you to give away Krabby Patties for free, all day tomorrow.
,Mr. Krabs:, Give away me patties for free? ,[sobs],  Oh no, I couldn't bear the sight of that. ,[cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab, and Mr. Krabs is screaming and wailing],
,SpongeBob:, Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties! ,[When SpongeBob gives away free Krabby Patties, the two policemen hold Mr. Krabs still while he screams and wails, then the policemen laugh],

,Patrick:, ,[angrily], Oh yeah, well uh, you know what's sad? This. ,[points to and touches SpongeBob's hat],
,SpongeBob:, My hat is sad?
,Patrick:, No! You have a special hat, which means you get to go to your special-happy-worky place. While I just stay... ,[turns around and whimpers some more], bored all day. I want a special-happy-worky place, too! ,[cries],

,SpongeBob:, Oof! ,[SpongeBob turns around and slaps his head], Ooh, I gotta run. I have patties to flip, ,[runs to the door], but I sure hope you figure your problem out. Think about it. ,[closes the door],
,Patrick:, Think about it. Think, Patrick, think. Hmmmmm... hmmpphh! ,[Patrick's head swells up like a balloon and pops.], Thinking is painful. ,[swings his deflated head over to look like a ponytail], Break time. ,[Walks over to SpongeBob's chair, sits down, picks up the remote and turns on the TV. TV shows commercial of Nicholas Withers on a small boat with three other fish in the background laying down and relaxing],
,Nicholas Whithers:, Are you irritable? Listless? Jobless? Have you ever asked yourself: ""I'm a loser. What am I doing with my life?"" Well, look no further. I have an answer that has helped millions- ,[Patrick changes channel. TV shows commercial of dolphins swimming and frolicking],
,Announcer:, Be all you can possibly be. ,[dolphin noise], Join the Marine Dolphins. ,[dolphin noise followed by Patrick changing the channel. TV then shows Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cornered by Man Ray with a raygun in his hand],
,Man Ray:, Muhahahahahahahaha! ,[Display case falls on Man Ray], Huh? ,[action card shows: “Clang!”], The inescapable display case! ,[Bangs on the case], Noooooooooo!
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[shakes Mermaid Man's hand], All in a day's work, ehh, Mermaid Man? ,[both superheroes face the screen],
,Mermaid Man:, Remember: It's up to you ,[points up with hand], to reveal the true face of crime. Sign up to be part of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Junior Crime Fighters. ,[Patrick turns off TV],
,Patrick:, ,[gets out of chair.], I gotta figure out what to do in my life. ,[Patrick steps on Mermaid Man doll that says: ""Fight evilllllllll!"". Patrick then picks up the toy], Awww, I wish I was a superhero. ,[Patrick's eyes burst in, then back out], I know what I want to do with my life! To the changing room! ,[rushes to the changing room followed by a ,real, sea star spinning towards then away from the screen], ,[scene transition cuts to Patrick pulling out his underwear and putting it on over his pants. Patrick then attempts to put a belt with a buckle with a star on it on, but is hard to put on because of his fat body. He then succeeds and clips the buckle in place], Ahhhhh. ,[His body fat then bursts in between his belly and his pectorals. He grabs a giant ice cream cone from SpongeBob's fridge, suddenly, with two blue gloves on his hands, and eats the ice cream and a portion of the cone. With ice cream on his mouth, he then slips the cone on his head and bulges his eyes through it. He grabs a jar of seanut butter and writes a backwards P on his chest with seanut butter on his tongue], At last I have found my calling. I am Patrick-Man: defender of Bikini Bottom! ,[Runs out the front door, then trips on a rock. He gets up and continues running],
,Mr. Krabs:, Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!
,Squidward:, Where? ,[The Krusty Krab is empty],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Where is everybody?
,[The doors open and Patrick appears at the doorway],
,Patrick:, Fear not, Patrick-Man is here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Patrick! I knew our number one customer wouldn't let us down. ,[Patrick comes towards Mr. Krabs to cover his mouth and begins shushing him],
,Patrick:, It's Patrick-Man, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
,Squidward:, Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?
,[Squidward and Mr. Krabs start laughing as Patrick looks down at his underwear. Then SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh! Blaring employee laughter in the common area? ,[SpongeBob joins in the laughter with Squidward and Mr. Krabs], Hey, Patrick, what's with the fancy duds?
,Patrick:, Must I explain everything? I found what I want to do with my life! I am Patrick-Man!
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps in amazement], That is so exciting! I can't wait to tell Gary, my parents, grandpar- ,[Before he can finish, Patrick quickly covers his mouth],
,Patrick:, Shush, SpongeBob! My identity must be kept secret! My work here is done. Patrick-Man is off! The city needs my help! ,[He runs off, but then comes back and holds up a dollar], Oh, I almost forgot, can I get a Krabby Patty?
,[bubble transition to high school. We then see three fish coming in the locker room looking at their exams.],
,Fish 1:, Hey, howdya do on your final?
,Fish 2:, ,[showing his paper], I aced it.
,Fish 1:, ,[showing his paper], Me, too.
,[Two fish laugh while Patrick spies on them from behind a corner],
,Fish 2:, Looks like all the studying paid off.
,Fish teenagers:, High five! ,[They raise their hands to a high five. Patrick gasps at this and runs in between the two teenagers. They hit their hands between the sides of Patrick's head],
,Fish 2:, Whoa, you okay. man?
,Patrick:, Just remember this: Violence solves nothing!
,Fish 2:, Violence? But we were just giving high fiv--.
,Patrick:, No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere! ,[He runs off leaving the two fish teenagers to look at each other in confusion],
,[bubble transition to a street corner. Mr. Krabs and Mabel are standing in front of a street],
,Mr. Krabs:, Please, ma'am, allow me. ,[Mr. Krabs grabs Mabel's bag that is in-between them],
,Mabel:, Huh? ,[Turns her neck, but uses her hands instead], Why, thank you, young man. ,[Street sign switches from ""don't walk"" to ""amble""],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hehehehe, not a problem, ma'am. It's the least I can doooooo! ,[Mr. Krabs spots a dollar on the street. The dollar is carried away by the wind], Sorry, lady, you're on your own. ,[Street sign switches from “amble” to “scamper”],
,Mabel:, Oh, dear. ,[Sign goes from scamper back to don't walk], ,[Cars trap Mabel], Oh, dear!
,[The dollar that was blown away is placed on the sidewalk. Mr. Krabs skids up to claim it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, sweet dollar. Oh, just look at you. So clean. So crisp. Now come to Krabsy. ,[Mr. Krabs tries to seize the dollar, but is hand chopped by Patrick-Man.],
,Patrick:, Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!
,Mr. Krabs:, But I found that dollar!
,Patrick:, Nah, enough! This dollar shall stay on the sidewalk, where it belongs. ,[Places dollar back on sidewalk], With Neptune's swiftness, away! ,[Attempts to fly, but is pushed down by gravity. He then walks with his face on the floor],
,Mabel:, ,[walks up to the sidewalk], Hey, a dollar! ,[Picks up the dollar and gasps. She proceeds to put the dollar in her shirt], This must be my lucky day.
,[Scene fades to Flipper's Donuts and shifts over to Patrick eating a donut in the garbage container at the back. A distant call for help is heard],
,Patrick:, Sounds like another job for Patrick-Man! ,[Licks the doughnut glaze off his mouth], I'll finish you off later, day-old donuts. Right now, I must move rapidly and act heroically! ,[Patrick walks to the source of the call at Mrs. Puff's Boating School], What's this? ,[Mrs. Puff is shown trying to open the door of a boat with her student, Nat, trapped inside], Don't move, and freeze!
,Mrs. Puff:, Huh? ,[Patrick-Man throws a net around Mrs. Puff.],
,Patrick:, Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!
,Mrs. Puff:, Boat thief? Heavens, no! My poor student is trapped inside this boat! The doors are jammed!
,Patrick:, Jammed doors, huh? ,[Writes a note and attaches it on Mrs. Puff], A likely story. With Neptune's swiftness, ,[Patrick-Man yet again attempts to fly, but is again pushed down by gravity], away! ,[He walks away with his body down again. A police van shows up shortly after],
,Mrs. Puff:, Ah, merciful Neptune! The authorities are here. You'll be out of there in no time.
,Officer John Slugfish:, Well, what do we have here? ,[Plucks note off and reads it. The note says: ""Kops!! this iz Bote Theef -Patrick-Man""], Looks like Patrick-Man caught another one! ,[With Police Officer 2 next to him, they both take off their hats], What would we do without superheroes? ,[Mrs. Puff is thrown into the van],
,Mrs. Puff:, But, I didn't do anything!
,Officer John Slugfish:, Grand Theft Vessel is a felony. You remember what a felony is, don't you, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, Felony?! Yes, I...! Oh, ugh. Patrick-Man... ,[Police Van drives away],
,Nat:, Help?
,[bubble transition to the Krusty Krab],
,SpongeBob:, Order up! Another Krabby Patty for the gentleman.
,Harold Reginald:, Thank you. Let's hope Patrick-Man doesn't confiscate this one.
,Tina:, Yeah! He drank my shake, too! Said it was part of an evil plot.
,SpongeBob:, Eh, sorry, ma'am. I'll get you another. Patrick has taken things too far. ,[Patrick is on his body on the kitchen floor],
,Patrick:, Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you. ,[Patrick gets up, revealing several wood pieces and burns on his body from sliding on the floor],
,SpongeBob:, What're you doing out there?
,Patrick:, Something a non-hero civilian would never understand. ,[Plucks a wood spike out of his body and screams in pain], I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes! ,[Shows SpongeBob a card order of a recipe for coral bits],
,SpongeBob:, You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?
,Patrick:, Overboaaard?! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's ,[Tries to jump through order window, but gets stuck], Swiftness! ,[Tries to pull himself through, but his fat body is wedged tight in the window], Villains and criminals, beware! ,[Keeps trying to pull himself free from the window], Patrick-Man is here! ,[Patrick pops out of the window, launches into Squidward and is sent flying past Mabel sitting at a table],
,Mabel:, Good gracious. ,[Turns neck again with hands],
,Patrick:, And he always finds out who hides under the mask! ,[Goes up to blue Fred and attempts to rip his face off],
,Fred:, Hey, man, I'd like to hold onto my face, thank you!
,Patrick:, Oh, right. ,[Walks up to two fish, male and female, and tries to rip their faces off], Gotcha!
,Male Fish:, Yeouch! Let's get out of here and never come back. ,[Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office and suddenly gets a super-stretched neck],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whaaaaaaaat?,[Patrick tries to rip another fish's face off], Alright, that does it!
,Patrick:, Admit it, masked marauder!
,Mr. Krabs:, Enough! ,[Pulls Patrick and carries him away], We've all had our fill of Patrick-Man!
,Patrick:, But I was about to unmask a supervillain!
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure you were. ,[Patrick grabs Mabel's head], What the barnacles are you doing?
,Patrick:, Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!
,Mabel:, Ohh, dear!
,SpongeBob:, Let her go, Patrick!
,Patrick:, No way! ,[Patrick rips off Mabel's head, which is actually a mask. SpongeBob gasps. The Dirty Bubble emerges from the clothes of Mabel and laughs maniacally], Hey! Where'd he come from?
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], The Dirty Bubble?!
,Patrick:, The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray.
,Dirty Bubble:, Fools, you blew my cover! Now taste my wrath!
,SpongeBob:, What now, Patrick?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers, ,[Picks up a barrel], and throw some stuff! ,[Patrick throws the barrel and hits Squidward],
,Dirty Bubble:, ,[laughs], I wouldn't call that a total miss. ,[Patrick has a table in his hand],
,Patrick:, Take this, beast! ,[Throws table, along with another barrel, but both miss. The table hits the cashier boat and the barrel hits the glass wall of the Krusty Krab and shatters it. Patrick grabs SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Wha, no, Patrick! ,[Patrick throws him],
,Dirty Bubble:, Haha, yummy sponge.
,Mr. Krabs:, You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?
,Patrick:, I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch! ,[Stench from Patrick's armpit forms a pit and flies toward the Dirty Bubble. The Dirty Bubble swallows it and it hits SpongeBob],
,Dirty Bubble:, Ha! Let's try that again, but this time, I attack! ,[Dirty Bubble is flying towards Patrick. Patrick gets scared. He looks down and sees an dirty Krabby Patty and picks it up],
,Patrick:, Lunch! ,[Patrick's ice cream cone point pops the charging Dirty Bubble, defeating him. The fish hiding behind the tables cheer in approval and Patrick eats the Krabby Patty],
,SpongeBob:, Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?
,Patrick:, Why, of course, young man. That's, uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?
,SpongeBob:, What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?
,Patrick:, Actually, ,[takes off the cone on his head], it's Patrick to you. ,[Eats cone], I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time. ,[Hands Patrick a broom and a dust pan. Scene zooms out and shows the Krusty Krab with broken furniture everywhere],
,Patrick:, What's this?

"[The episode begins at Patrick's house.],
,Patrick:, Ahh! Sea spider! Sea spider! Sea spider!
,[The sea spider roars. Patrick screams and jumps on his sand chandelier. However, when he tries to hold on, it breaks into bits of sand and he falls down. Patrick picks up a sand chair.],
,Patrick:, Back! Back!
,[The chair disintegrates into sand. Patrick backs away and ends up getting caught in the sea spider's web behind him. He tries to free himself but it was no use. The sea spider crawls down Patrick attempts to blow it away. But the sea spider crawls onto him, shoots its web on Patrick's eye and traps him in a cocoon. The sea spider then cuts the web and Patrick falls to the floor.],
,Patrick:, Whoa!
,[Patrick rolls under his sand chair and pops back up with a coupon on his head.],
,Patrick:, Oh, boy! Here it is! My lost coupon! I found it!
,[Patrick breaks himself free from the cocoon and he and the sea spider give a respectful bow.],
,Patrick:, You have fought well today, sea spider, and now I must leave. For I am going to use this coupon to get an ice cream for my bestest friend in the whole ocean—um.. ,[looks at his picture with SpongeBob], Sponge Knob Hair Pants! ,[jumps out of his house and looks around], Hmm. ,[looks the other way], Hmm!
,[SpongeBob appears behind Patrick, slurping an ice cream cone.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[stutters], Oh.
,SpongeBob:, What you doin'?
,Patrick:, I got this here free coupon and I'm gonna get you an ice cream.
,SpongeBob:, That's nice of you, buddy, but I already got an ice cream.
,Patrick:, Uh...but I'm getting you an ice cream!
,SpongeBob:, Why would ya? I already got one.
,Patrick:, ,[swats the ice cream cone off of SpongeBob's hand], Because I'm a nice guy! ,[angrily walks off],
,SpongeBob:, Wow. There goes the nicest guy.
,[The scene changes to Patrick walking past the Krusty Krab. A metal claw comes down and grabs Patrick. Patrick slips off and falls on the ground. The claw grabs Patrick again, but he slips off and falls again. The claw grabs Patrick the third time, and manages to get a grip on Patrick.],
,Patrick:, Whoa.
,[The claw swings him over to Mr. Krabs, who appears to be operating the claw with his construction crane.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hooray! I win a free coupon!
,Patrick:, H-how did you know about my free coupon?
,Mr. Krabs:, Me back knows. ,[pulls up his shirt and his hives appear in the word ""free""], It breaks out in hives around anything free.
,Patrick:, ,[grossed out], Guh.
,Mr. Krabs:, I also know how heavy a free coupon can be.
,Patrick:, It's heavy?
,[Patrick's coupon falls with the ground. Patrick attempts to lift it, but it's too heavy.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Much too much responsibility for a carefree fellow like you. Tell you what. I'll take that free coupon off your hands for the price of a hearty handshake. ,[holds out his hand],
,Patrick:, Uh...Oh. Ohh! Oh! SpongeBob does love handshakes.
,[Patrick goes to do a handshake with Mr. Krabs. All of a sudden, Squidward appears in between them, holding a sandwich.],
,Squidward:, You should be ashamed of yourself! Taking advantage of a simpleton. ,[pushes Patrick and eats his sandwich],
,Mr. Krabs:, Aww, come on. Can't an old crab have a little unscrupulous fun anymore? ,[leaves],
,Patrick:, Hey, you ruined my deal! I almost had a handshake!
,[Patrick tries to hit at Squidward],
,Squidward:, ,[pulls the lever in the crane's controller and sets Patrick down], Oh, you dingdong wing nut! Krabs was just trying to steal your coupon! ,[walks on Patrick and leaves],
,Patrick:, Steal my coupon? Hmm. ,[gasps, backs away and bumps into Dave], You want my ice cream coupon! You can't have it!
,Dave:, Okay. Whatever.
,Orchid:, He never really knew how to sing.
,Orchid's friend:, No! Singers?
,Patrick:, You.
,Both:, Hmm?
,Patrick:, Oh, I see you...peeking at my coupon! It's for SpongeBob's ice cream!
,Orchid:, ,[sarcastically], Hooray for SpongeBob.
,[Just then, various people arrive and question about the commotion Patrick is making.],
,Bikini Bottomites:, Hey, what's going on here? ,[indistinct chatter],
,Patrick:, Get away from me! All of you! You're all after my coupon!
,[Patrick hovers in a fetal position. He begins to hallucinate and sees illusions of people chanting over him.],
,Bikini Bottomites:, Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon!
,[During Patrick's hallucination, his coupon flips and Patrick hovers onto it while various people keep chanting over him.],
,Patrick:, No! You can't have my coupon! No! No!
,[In reality, Patrick is in the middle of the street while hovering in a fetal position. Next to him is a motorbike and a police officer eating at the Café Poulpe. His radio buzzes.],
,Radio Dispatcher:, Officer Slugfish? We got a call about a sea star disturbance on your beat. Please investigate.
,Officer Slugfish:, Roger, headquarters. Hey, you.
,[Patrick turns and looks at the cop. He sprints away.],
,Officer Slugfish:, Headquarters? I couldn't catch him. He got away. ,[eats pie],
,[Patrick continues to run. He jumps over the fence and crashes in the middle of a little girl's tea party with her friends.],
,Little Girl:, You're a bad baby!
,[The girls beat Patrick up and he runs over the fence with a baby costume on.],
,Patrick:, Whaa!
,[Patrick's baby costume falls off as he runs. He stops in front of the entrance to Clams Theater. Cameras are clicking everywhere. Patrick forms into a flat star on the sidewalk.],
,Thaddeus:, Oh, look, honey, it's Bikini Bottom's Sidewalk of the Stars. ,[chuckles],
,[The couple take pictures of the sidewalk and notice Patrick.],
,Nancy Suzy Fish:, This one's gruesome. Hmm, looks like some kids' cartoon. Should we take a photo?
,Thaddeus:, Nah, waste of film.
,[The couple walk away and Patrick straightens himself up.],
,Patrick:, Ooh. ,[his coupon gets blown away], Ah! Come back! ,[grabs the coupon and falls off the cliff], Ah! ,[lands in front of the Ice Cream Store], I made it. ,[laughs as he runs into the store], It's beautiful.
,[Inside the Ice Cream Store, it was the most amazing thing Patrick has ever seen. There are sprinkle fountains, chocolate syrup waterfalls and rivers, candy cane trees, ice cream mountains, and an ice cream roller coaster that goes around tables. Patrick's mouth begins to water and he slowly walks over to the counter.],
,Lou:, And a good ice cream day to you, sir.
,Patrick:, Yes, it's a good day for ice cream!
,Lou:, And what's your pleasure?
,Patrick:, Oh, I want your bestest ice cream for my bestest buddy, SpongeBob!
,Lou:, Excellent choice, sir. One Heavenly Paradise coming up.
,[Lou pulls the rubber cow utter and the Heavenly Paradise sundae comes down on a roller coaster cart. The customers cheer and applaud as Patrick's eyes glimmer. The trumpeters blow their candy cane trumpets and the sundae stops right in front of Patrick. Patrick jumps up and down in excitement and the Ice Cream Store employee hands him a spoon. Patrick grabs the spoon and gives the employee his coupon.],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob won't mind if I just take a little taste.
,[Patrick goes to take a taste. When suddenly, the buzzer goes off and the sundae gets pulled away from him.],
,Ice Cream Store Employee:, Aw, this coupon's out of date. Expired two years ago. Sorry, we can't honor it. ,[grabs the spoon and leaves],
,Patrick:, No ice cream for SpongeBob? Uh!
,[Patrick grunts loudly as he attempts to snag someone else's ice cream. Patrick begins to lose his sanity and goes into a temper tantrum.],
,Patrick:, I demand that you honor my coupon! ,[sobs loudly],
,Lou:, ,[grabs his ice cream-themed phone], Temper tantrum in center aisle!
,Ice Cream Store Janitor:, I'm on it. ,[pushes Patrick out of the store with his mop],
,Patrick:, Take my coupon! Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Ah, take my—
,Ice Cream Store Janitor:, You poor, miserable creature.
,Patrick:, I'm miserable.
,Ice Cream Store Janitor:, You wretched, worthless, shabby—
,Jimmy Gus:, Hey, don't you think you're being a little harsh?
,Ice Cream Store Janitor:, Not really. Look at him.
,Jimmy Gus:, ,[looks at Patrick], Uh! Never mind. Continue and bump it up a little bit.
,[The Ice Cream Store janitor lifts Patrick up with his mop.],
,Ice Cream Store Janitor:, Listen, buddy, there is one person who can honor this coupon; the person who owns this store. The Ice Cream King himself.
,Patrick:, The Ice Cream King?
,Ice Cream Store Janitor:, Oh, yeah. He lives up there in that mansion.
,Patrick:, Wow.
,Ice Cream Store Janitor:, Do you need a push?
,Patrick:, Yeah. Would you, please?
,[The Ice Cream Store janitor pushes Patrick with his mop and Patrick runs up the mountain in a fast pace. He manages to reach the mansion and knocks on the door.],
,Patrick:, Hello?
,[The door opens and two eyes are seen. A pink arm grabs Patrick and pulls him in. Inside the mansion, there are pictures of ice cream and the Ice Cream King. In the middle is a tall throne that looks like ice cream. The creature who pulled Patrick inside was the Ice Cream King himself, who appears to be almost identical to Patrick.],
,Ice Cream King:, Are you the exterminator?
,Patrick:, Oh. ,[laughs], No. I'm not the extra gator. I'm here to redeem my coupon for a free ice cream! It's for my bestest friend, but it's out of date.
,Ice Cream King:, ,[points to a pile of coupons], They're all out of date because I don't know what year it is.
,Patrick:, I don't know what anything is.
,[Patrick and the Ice Cream King look at each other.],
,Ice Cream King:, Are you smart or dumb?
,Patrick:, ,[thinks for a bit], Apples?
,Ice Cream King:, Genius! Let's see your head. ,[squeezes Patrick's head], I can't feel your brain.
,Patrick:, ,[lifts his foot with his brain appearing in it], It's down here today.
,Ice Cream King:, ,[lifts his foot with his brain appearing in it], Mine too! High five!
,[They do a high five but end up hitting each other.],
,Ice Cream King:, Secret handshake?
,[They both slap each other and fly around all over the place until they stop.],
,Ice Cream King:, Perfect! You don't know the secret handshake either. Hey, I don't know your name. ,[pushes Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hey, you're right! ,[pushes the Ice Cream King],
,Ice Cream King:, ,[snatches the coupon from Patrick], This may still be redeemable according to the fine print.
,[Patrick attempts to read the fine print, but he can't see it. He pulls his eyes out.],
,Patrick:, I didn't bring my reading eyes.
,Ice Cream King:, Try my glasses! ,[holds up two glasses],
,[The Ice Cream King puts the two glasses on Patrick's eye sockets and Patrick reads the fine print.],
,Patrick:, Oh, ooh. It says ""garbaldy goop.""
,Ice Cream King:, But spelled backwards is... ,[words in black and white], ""Poog Ydlabrag."" The King's Challenge!
,[The scene changes to Patrick and the Ice Cream King sitting on an ice cream sandwich mat.],
,Ice Cream King:, Hair growing contest! ,[strains and grows himself eyebrows], Ah-ha!
,Patrick:, Wow. Oh... ,[strains as he grows a beard on his chin],
,[The Ice Cream King looks at Patrick's beard, but is not overly impressed by it.],
,Ice Cream King:, That's sad. Watch this. ,[strains for a bit and grows himself a hairdo], Try beating that.
,Patrick:, Oh, man. ,[strains for a bit but cannot grow anymore hair],
,Ice Cream King:, Ha, ha! I beat you.
,Patrick:, Not so fast! ,[shows armpit hair], Ha! Can I redeem my coupon now?
,Ice Cream King:, Not just yet. Best two out of three.
,[The Ice Cream King grabs Patrick and they dress each other in Ice Cream wrestling outfits. They both give each other a respectful bow and begin their fight.],
,Both:, Ooh.
,Ice Cream King:, ,[does his action pose], Your butterscotch style is strong, Low Fat, but it is no match for my brownie bits!
,Patrick:, Ha, ha, ha! You'll wish your cone was a cup when I whip you into cream! Hi-ya! ,[shouts as he does he action pose],
,[The Ice Cream King and Patrick charge at each other and begin their fight. As they fight, their wrestling outfits break apart.],
,Patrick:, They told me you had scoops, but your serve is soft. I see you've studied the ancient art of failure! ,[smacks the Ice Cream King's butt], Redeem my coupon!
,Ice Cream King:, ,[gets up], Think fast— ,[shoots rainbow sprinkles from his hand], rainbow sprinkles!
,[Patrick uses the two glasses on his eyes to deflect the sprinkles. The sprinkles land on Patrick's tongue and he eats them.],
,Ice Cream King:, You have played with skill and courage. I will honor your coupon.
,[Patrick giggles and claps. The Ice Cream King pulls out an ice cream cone covered with hair from his armpit.],
,Ice Cream King:, One free ice cream cone!
,[The two glases fall off of Patrick's eyes as he is shocked. The scene changes to Patrick arriving at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob opens the door.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hello, Patrick. What's up?
,Patrick:, I was gonna give you this ice cream, ,[holds out the melted ice cream cone], but it melted. Instead, I got you this hearty handshake. ,[holds out one of Mr. Krab's claws],
,SpongeBob:, Aw, I love hearty handshakes, but not as much as I love ice cream!
,[SpongeBob points to the Heavenly Paradise sundae in the middle of the living room.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds up a spoon], Care to join me?
,Both:, Whoo-hoo!
,[Patrick and SpongeBob jump into the sundae and ice cream splatters all over the screen. The ice cream splatter forms the words, ""The End,"" ending the episode.],

"[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick, who are seen playing a board game between Patrick's rock and Squidward's house],
,Patrick:, I don't get it! What's an audit?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. Let me check the rules. ,[drops the giant rule book on the ground, opening it], Playing ""Certified Public Accountant"" isn't as much fun as I thought. ,[he slides the book away], Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!
,Patrick:, ,[grabs the dice, shaking it], I am rolling the dice! ,[he rolls the dice], Now I am moving! ,[he picks up a piece and puts it in another spot, picking up a card], ""Run...Spreadsheets""?
,SpongeBob:, What does that even mean?! ,[As SpongeBob is talking, the screen goes over to Squidward, who is sunbathing. Squidward, annoyed by their shouting, turns up the volume on his iPod.],
,Patrick:, Well, maybe I'm supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, that sounds right to me!
,[Patrick flips the sheet and all the pieces to the game fall on Squidward. Squidward gets irritated as Patrick runs around with the sheet while SpongeBob laughs.],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward. Wanna play ""Certified Public Accountant"" with us?
,Squidward:, Oh, let me think. That sounds so no!
,[Patrick keeps running around with the sheet until he trips on the game board.],
,Patrick:, I don't think this game is ripe.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon.
,Squidward:, ,[scoffs], What? Do you think that games grow on trees? ,[laughs],
,Patrick:, Doesn't everything grow on trees?
,Squidward:, No, you ninny! Somebody makes them.
,Patrick:, Makes them?
,Squidward:, Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game.
,Patrick:, Then I could make a game?
,Squidward:, No, you couldn't. You would be incapable.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I think Patrick could make up a game.
,Squidward:, Your operative word there is think.
,Patrick:, Yeah! The opernive... word is think! ,[laughs], Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!
,SpongeBob:, Go get'em, Patrick!

,Patrick:, I invented a game! I invented a game!
,Squidward:, Whoopee. Do tell.
,Patrick:, Well, you know how hard ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" is and how it always takes so long to play?
,Squidward:, Uh-huh.
,Patrick:, Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!
,Squidward:, ,[sighs], I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?
,Patrick:, It's called... ,[hold out a notebook], ""Tic-Tac""! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh... ,[thinks],
,Squidward:, O?
,Patrick:, Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, ""Tic-Tac""!. ,[rips off paper and laughs], You start!
,[Squidward draws an X then Patrick draws an O. Squidward draws another X and draws a line through them.],
,Squidward:, Tic-Tac.
,Patrick:, Uh... ,[rips off paper], Best two out of four?
,French Narrator:, Many Tic-Tacs later...
,[Squidward and Patrick had been playing ""Tic-Tac"" for a while. As they played one more time, Patrick becomes worried as Squidward draws in the notebook.],
,Squidward:, Tic and Tac.
,Patrick:, I should've gone with my first idea: ""Tic"".
,[The scene changes to Squidward riding his recumbent bicycle. Patrick runs up to him.],
,Patrick:, Squidward, I got a new game! It's called ""Rock, Paper, Butter""!
,[Patrick holds out a stick of butter melting in his hand.],
,Squidward:, Butterin' than the different game? ,[laughs],
,[Squidward rides away as Patrick eats the stick of butter and sulks sadly back home. The scene changes to Squidward watering his garden. Patrick shows up with two ropes. A long one and a short one.],
,Patrick:, Squidward, I got it! ,[throws the ropes on the ground], Whose rope is longer? You... ,[Squidward picks up the long rope before Patrick finishes], Aww! You played this before!
,[Patrick walks away angrily. The scene changes to Sandy's treedome.],
,Patrick:, Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.
,Sandy:, ,[puts some stuff in her blender], If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them. ,[mixes her blender], Then you can use those elements in the game you invent. ,[drinks her smoothie she made from her blender],
,[Mini Brain Patrick pops out of Patrick's eye and throws a light bulb above his head. Once Mini Brain Patrick puts Patrick eye back in place, Patrick pulled the rope and lights up the light bulb, which helped him get an idea.],
,Patrick:, ,[gasps], I know what to do!
,[The scene changes to Patrick's rock and all of Patrick's board games are stack on a table.],
,Patrick:, And so it begins.
,[Patrick begins creating his game. First, he takes a game piece, puts glue on it, and adds google eyes. Then he cuts a board game in half with the scissors, which resulted in cutting himself in half. Then he glues the board together and puts some tape on it. However, the tape slides off because the glues was still wet, but Patrick didn't mind. Patrick continued working on his game for a few hours, and by the time he was finished, he pulled the lever and electricity starts bringing the game to life as if he was a mad scientist bringing a robot to life in a horror movie.],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs maniacally], It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!
,[The scene changes to Sandy, Squidward and SpongeBob walking to Patrick's place at night.],
,Squidward:, I don't see the point to this game night. Every game that Patrick has ""invented"" is more pointless and boring than the last.
,Sandy:, This time, he did research.
,Squidward:, Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.
,Sandy:, Well, I'm excited! We're gonna be the first people to test out Patrick's game!
,SpongeBob:, This is gonna be written about it in the history book someday.
,Squidward:, Yeah. In crayon.
,[Everyone shows up at Patrick's rock and Patrick comes out.],
,Patrick:, Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium.
,[Everyone steps inside Patrick's rock.],
,Squidward:, More like a lamatourium. Ha.
,[Patrick closes the rock and lands on his chair.],
,Patrick:, Welcome, gamers! And behold! ,[thunderclaps], My game!
,[Patrick's game board is made out of random board games and is shaped like Patrick himself.],
,SpongeBob:, It's beautiful!
,Squidward:, ,[yawns], Are we finished? Who won? ,[Sandy, disgusted by Squidward's rude behavior, hits Squidward's arm],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], No, my friend. We have only just begun.
,Sandy:, What's it called, Patrick?
,Squidward:, Might I suggest ""garbage""? ,[Sandy growls at Squidward], What?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?
,[As Patrick thinks, Mini Brain Patrick pushes a light bulb out of his head and it lights up.],
,Patrick:, It's called... Patrick! The Game! ,[thunderclaps],
,SpongeBob:, Wow!
,Squidward:, Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma. ,[Sandy zips Squidward's mouth shut],
,Patrick:, Alright! ,[eats some snacks], I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice. ,[As Patrick explains, Sandy and SpongeBob are amazed. But Squidward, on the other hand, was getting impatient], To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...
,Squidward:, Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?
,Patrick:, You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?
,Squidward:, ,[annoyed], Both!
,Patrick:, Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.
,Squidward:, I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.
,Patrick:, Hmm... ,[thinks], Okay! ,[Patrick rolls the dice and gets three dots. He moves his game piece and lands on free money.], Oh, money! ,[throw money in the air],
,[Sandy rolls the dice, moves her game piece and lands on Goo Lagoon.],
,Sandy:, Yee-haw! Beachfront property! ,[places a house shaped piece on Goo Lagoon],
,[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets four dots. He moves his game piece and lands on a treasure chest. SpongeBob takes a treasure which has diver's license on it.],
,SpongeBob:, Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?
,Patrick:, Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
,Squidward:, Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!
,[Squidward rolls the dice and gets six dots. Squidward moves his game piece and lands on ""Go to jail"".],
,Squidward:, Uh-huh.
,Patrick:, You go to jail.
,[Patrick puts a cardboard box with the word jail on it. Everyone laughs at Squidward as a blue fish head appears next to him.],
,Blue Cellmate:, What are you in for, pal?
,Patrick:, My turn! ,[rolls the dice and spits it out of his mouth], One... two...
,[Patrick moves his piece to snacks. Once it landed, snack pops out and feeds Patrick.],
,Squidward:, Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished.
,[Sandy rolls the dice and gets two dots. She moves her piece to Coral Avenue.],
,Sandy:, Hmm... Coral Avenue. I'll buy it!
,[Sandy hands out her money while SpongeBob rolls the dice.],
,SpongeBob:, Twelve. I'll... drive the car!
,[Squidward rolls the dice.],
,Patrick:, Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail.
,Squidward:, Well, what do I do to get out of jail?
,Patrick:, You have to roll a six.
,[Squidward rolls the dice again.],
,Patrick:, Hey! You can't roll the dice when you're in jail!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, play by the rules.
,Squidward:, Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six! And I can't roll if I'm in jail! Just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick pulls out a rule card.], Ah, here it is! ,[writes on it], The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name.
,Squidward:, ,[calmly], Fine. Someone say my name.
,[Everyone laughs at Squidward. Sandy rolls the dice and moves her piece to surgery.],
,Patrick:, Oh boy! You landed on ""Do a Surgery""! ,[Patrick holds cards while wearing an operation mask.], Now, pick a surgery card.
,Sandy:, ,[Sandy takes a card], Hmm... Remove finbone from player to your left.
,[Patrick grabs Squidward and puts him on the game board.],
,Squidward:, What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!
,Sandy:, Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit.
,[Sandy takes the tweezers and removes a plastic bone from the game board.],
,Sandy:, Got it.
,Patrick:, Now, sit back down, you criminal!
,Squidward:, Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!
,SpongeBob:, Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved.
,Squidward:, Well, neither have you.
,[SpongeBob puts a driving helmet on and starts riding on the board with the race car toy.],
,Squidward:, ,[takes off the cardboard box], That's it! I've had enough!
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Squidward! Wait!
,Sandy:, Don't go, Squidward!
,Patrick:, No wait, Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward!
,Patrick:, Wait, how'd he get out of jail?
,SpongeBob:, Squidward made us say his name.
,Sandy:, That was a smart move, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Huh? Oh. Hmm... ,[thinks for a bit and goes back to playing],
,SpongeBob:, Now you roll after me.
,[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets five dots.],
,SpongeBob:, Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll...
,Squidward:, Race the car.
,SpongeBob:, I'll...
,Squidward:, Race the car!
,SpongeBob:, I'll... race the car!
,[SpongeBob puts the driving helmet back on and races around the track again. Squidward rolls the dice and gets two dots.],
,Squidward:, Oh boy! Snacks!
,[He moves his piece and lands on snacks. SpongeBob continues racing on the track but his movements literally makes Squidward's piece go back to jail.],
,Patrick:, Jail for Squidward!
,Squidward:, But I was on snacks!
,Patrick:, Tell it to the judge!
,[Patrick puts the cardboard box back on Squidward.],
,Squidward:, Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!
,Patrick:, Starving! Starving sea star time!
,[Sandy and SpongeBob feeds Patrick random snacks.],
,Squidward:, ,[takes off the box], Okay, I'm going outside.
,Patrick:, ,[Patrick writes on his rule card.], If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside.
,Squidward:, But I didn't say ""outsidies"" I said...
,[Everyone pushes Squidward outside of Patrick's rock. Patrick rolls the dice and gets four dots.],
,Patrick:, Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!
,[Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick laughs. Sandy growls at Squidward to make him join.],
,Squidward:, Ha.
,[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets two dots.],
,SpongeBob:, Two. ,[takes a card], Silly face! Silly face!
,[Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick make silly faces, but Squidward gets very irritated.],
,Sandy:, Now, that's a silly face!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!
,Squidward:, Oh, I get the rules alright! The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means! ,[takes the dice and rolls them], So, I could just roll the dice and say, ""Automatic Winner!""
,SpongeBob:, Good job, Squidward! You've won!
,Sandy:, Nice play, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play.
,Patrick:, Not so fast! ,[writes on his rule card], No player may declare himself ""Automatic Winner.""
,Squidward:, You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!
,[Squidward grabs Patrick's game board and shakes it off of Patrick. Then he throws Patrick in the air and when Patrick landed, the game breaks in half. Squidward then destroys the game board out of insane anger. However, the police arrives at the scene.],
,Highway Speed Patrol:, Destruction to private property.
,[Patrick writes on his rule card and gives it to the police. Squidward tries to walk away but Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol follow him.],
,Highway Speed Patrol:, Oh, and I see here you are a repeat offender. You're going to real jail.
,[Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol grab Squidward and threw him in the police car.],
,Squidward:, Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!
,Blue Cellmate:, Welcome back!
,Squidward:, Somebody say my name!
,[The police car drives away as the episode ends with Patrick appearing on a game board box.],
,Patrick:, Game over!

"[SpongeBob & Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields laughing trying to capture jellyfish],
,Patrick:, ,[pokes SpongeBob], You're it. ,[both laugh],
,SpongeBob:, ,[pokes Patrick], You're it. ,[both laugh. Patrick runs off], Wait, Pat, you're it! ,[notices a sign a few yards away and yelps. Patrick laughs, not paying attention], The sign!
,Patrick:, Huh? ,[tries to read it as he is running], Duuhh... aaann... ger... ,[crashes through the sign and falls off the cliff], cliff!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! ,[runs down the cliff to Patrick], Let me help you out of there, buddy! ,[grabs a starfish shaped head out of the ground. When he notices it's just a head, he screams], Is the rest of you down there?
,Patrick:, ,[walks up to SpongeBob with no head attached to his body], The rest of me is up here.
,SpongeBob:, Whew, you had me worried there, buddy. ,[laughs], Here's your head. ,[attaches the head onto Patrick and laughs. Picture of inside Patrick's head shows a plug plugging into an outlet. Gears and cranks start up. Patrick gets a spark or two from his head],
,Patrick:, I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
,SpongeBob:, Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'! ,[takes out two jellyfish nets. Hands a net to Patrick], Go ahead, you get first crack.
,Patrick:, ,[jellyfish floats by], Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
,SpongeBob:, Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.
,Patrick:, Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
,SpongeBob:, Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick. ,[captures a jellyfish], Look, buddy, I captured one!
,Patrick:, Yes... ,[shows SpongeBob a notebook with a Davinci-style jellyfish drawn], I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. ,[frees the jellyfish from SpongeBob's net],
,SpongeBob:, Okay...what do you wanna do?
,Patrick:, Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
,SpongeBob:, Pretty.
,Patrick:, Yes, quite.
,SpongeBob:, Fragile.
,Patrick:, Indeed.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumps at Patrick three times], C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun.
,Patrick:, Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
,SpongeBob:, I was thinking more like jumping rope, ,[jumps rope with his arms], 1-legged races ,[one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg],, or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. ,[jumps into a hermit-crab shell and blows bubbles],
,Patrick:, Doesn't feel like fun.
,SpongeBob:, ,[pops out of the shell], How about some jokes? ,[Patrick sighs], Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?
,Patrick:, You can't ,strum, a jellyfish.
,SpongeBob:, Yes! ,[laughs. Patrick grabs a jellyfish and strums its tentacles],
,Patrick:, Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going. ,[walks off],
,SpongeBob:, What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon. ,[at Patrick's house where Patrick is doing some scientific work], Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?
,Patrick:, Just studying this amazing sub-species.
,Plankton:, ,[through a microscope], I'll show you subspecies!
,SpongeBob:, Wanna visit Squidward?
,Patrick:, Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits. ,[now at Squidward's house where Squidward is playing his clarinet. He hears SpongeBob and Patrick come in and prepares to yell at them], I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, ""Symphony in Blue.""
,Squidward:, ,[very confused], Patrick?
,Patrick:, It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work. ,[walks over to the piano], May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.
,Squidward:, Wow, I never thought to do it like that.
,Patrick:, Well, that is because you rarely think.
,SpongeBob:, How do you know so much about music?
,Patrick:, A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance. ,[inhales], Ah.
,SpongeBob:, Does that include... ,[burps], belch-talk-ing?
,Patrick:, ,[waving his hand in front of his face], Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor ,vulgar.,
,Squidward:, I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick. Do you think you can be my musical mentor?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, guys?
,Patrick:, Let's take it from the top. ,[Squidward plays, badly], Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique. ,[looks at clarinet with spit covered all over the mouth piece], On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin. ,[SpongeBob comes up playing his musical nose as a flute], Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4... ,[Squidward plays more. SpongeBob frowns and walks out. Patrick covers his ears since Squidward's playing is still terrible], Stop! Enough! ,[walks out], Find yourself a new mentor!
,SpongeBob:, Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.
,Patrick:, No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.
,SpongeBob:, Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap. ,[blows a bubble that pops on Patrick's face],
,Patrick:, ,[wiping his face], No, thanks again.
,SpongeBob:, Well, maybe later we can play pirates.
,Patrick:, Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.
,SpongeBob:, What? What do you mean?
,Patrick:, I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.
,SpongeBob:, ,[starting to cry], But Patrick... you're my best friend.
,Patrick:, I know it's hard, but brace up, chap.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah.
,Patrick:, Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.
,SpongeBob:, Goodbye... Mr... Best friend! ,[sobs. At Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob rings her doorbell], Sandy, you there? I need some professional help. ,[Sandy and Patrick are heard laughing inside], Patrick?
,Sandy:, Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.
,Patrick:, Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.
,Sandy:, Oh, really? Well, thanks. ,[SpongeBob cries then walks away from the treedome, at a chalkboard, there's an equation on it], Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?
,Patrick:, ,[changes formula], You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.
,Sandy:, ,[angrily puts her hands on her hips], What do you mean by that, Patrick?
,Patrick:, I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.
,Sandy:, Are you suggesting I'm ,dumb?,
,Patrick:, I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.
,Sandy:, I think you'd better leave.
,Patrick:, I was only trying to help. ,[walks off],
,Sandy:, I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all. I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!
,SpongeBob:, ,[sitting on his chair at home, crying], I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!
,Patrick:, ,[sitting on his chair at home], Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with? ,[notices a book on the table next to him called 'MY FRIEND SPONGEBOB'], SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at his 'MY FRIEND PATRICK' book], Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories. ,[SpongeBob looks at several pictures of him and Patrick together, as SpongeBob begins to cry another picture is shown, it's revealed that Patrick is the one who put a tear on the last picture],
,Patrick:, Aww, the glory days, why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem! ,[looks at x-rays of him and SpongeBob's head, meditates on top of his rock, studies Squidward, reads a book. He puts the book down and shows his bloodshot eyes], What could it be? ,[applies a chemical on his head and grows hair], What's different? Ah! ,[tears out his hair], What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!
,SpongeBob:, ,[doorbell rings], Coming... ,[opens door and gets kidnapped in a jellyfish net. Patrick is shown carrying the net over his shoulder with SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob pops out happily], Patrick, you're kidnapping me?
,Patrick:, Yes, I am.
,SpongeBob:, Yay! ,[jumps out of the net and writes ""Yippie"" in the air with bubble soap], What should we do?
,Patrick:, We are going to have fun. Whatever the cost may be.
,SpongeBob:, Let's do this.
,Patrick:, Yes, let's have some fun.
,SpongeBob:, ,[jumping around], Oh, yeah!
,Patrick:, ,[jumping around], Oh, absolutely! ,[now riding on a shell down a mountain], Are you quite sure I found this activity to be ,fun?,
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. ,[screams with enjoyment. Shell lunges them into the sand], That was fun, huh Patrick?
,Patrick:, ,[Swallows a mouth-full of sand], When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.
,Patrick:, That's it! ,[runs off],
,SpongeBob:, That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?
,Patrick:, I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...nge! ,[falls off the cliff],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Hold on, buddy! ,[takes Patrick out of the ground], There ya go. ,[notices he has no head and screams], Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again! ,[searches around some coral], Not back there. ,[checks under a rock], Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick! ,[turns around and runs into Patrick making his head pop out], Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?
,Patrick:, Quite unchanged, actually.
,SpongeBob:, I guess... we'll never have fun together again.
,Patrick:, You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.
,SpongeBob:, Yes.
,Patrick:, Where exactly did you find it?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, it was right here.
,Patrick:, Hmmm, impossible! If I landed ,here,, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not ,there,, but ,here,, exactly five meters due north.
,SpongeBob:, But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over... ,[sign says 'Brain Coral Field'], Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy. ,[blows off the Poison Sea Urchins off Patrick's head], Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?
,Patrick:, Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!
,SpongeBob:, Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal. ,[Patrick takes off his coral head and SpongeBob puts his old one back on], Patrick? Say something, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[burps], Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you're back!
,Patrick:, Patrick, you're back. ,[both laugh, then pull out their jellyfish nets, make oo-loo-loo sounds, and run off into the sunset],

"[The episode begins with a storybook entitled ""Patnocchio."" The book opens and the screens zooms into the picture of Karen in a beautiful fairy outfit holding her wand. She is seen standing outside of Bikini Bottom at night.],
,Karen:, Greetings, children of Bikini Bottom. I am Karen the Computer Fairy. ,[waves her wand and a scallop flies on her hand; she sings real loud, which causes the scallop to shatter into bits], And I have a magic tale to tell. ,[waves her wand and a picture of Patrick appears on her screen], Once upon a time, there was a dim-witted sea star ,[Patrick appears in a puppet outfit and looks a lot like the character, Pinocchio], who was about to stuff his fat face. ,[waves her wand with the word ""Magics"" fly by; her screen shows the Krusty Krab],
,[At the Krusty Krab, Patrick comes out through the doors with a plate full of Krabby Patties. He takes a seat on a table and goes to eat his meal. Little did Patrick know, Plankton was observing him through a magnifying glass about his restaurant.],
,Plankton:, Hee, hee, hee. That idiot has such a huge pile of patties. I don't think he'll notice if one walks away. ,[laughs],
,[Patrick continues to eat his lunch. Plankton flies into the patties and peaks out.],
,Patrick:, Aw, I need more ketchup. ,[hops out of his chair and runs back in for ketchup],

,Plankton:, Get me an ice pack, you idiot!

,SpongeBob:, Uh, Patrick?

,SpongeBob:, Oh, that's probably your conscience.
,Patrick:, What are conscience? Are they bad?
,SpongeBob:, No. A conscience is a tiny voice inside you that tells you the difference between something that's right and something ,[gives Patrick a wedgie], that's wrong.
,Patrick:, So, I should do what the voice tells me to do?
,SpongeBob:, ,[pats Patrick's head], Now that's a smart little sea star. ,[leaves],

He decides to take advantage of the opportunity by posing himself as Patrick's conscience so he'll get a Krabby Patty and now the formula. Plankton peels himself off of Patrick's butt and runs off. Patrick sips down some soda just as Plankton climbs up his shoulder in conscience disguise, which is the similar clothing to the character, Jiminy Cricket.],
,Plankton:, Patrick, this is your conscience speaking.

,[The Goofy Goober waiter pulls down the lever and swirls Plankton into a soft serve ice cream cone. He gives the cone to Patrick. Patrick begins to eat Plankton. Plankton bites Patrick's tongue.],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], Ow. You hate high-fives and ice cream? Are you sure you're my conscience? ,[looks at Plankton],
,Plankton:, I, uh, I'm absolutely positively your conscience. ,[his nose grows into Patrick's eye],
,Patrick:, Hey, doesn't your nose grow when you tell lies in fairy tales?
,Plankton:, Nope. Noses only grow when you make up the truth. ,[his nose grows longer], See?
,Patrick:, Ah-ha-ha! Oh, oh, I wanna make up the truth, too! Uh, I ate a hot air balloon for breakfast. ,[nothing happens], I—I—I mean, um, I did not eat a hot air balloon for breakfast. ,[his nose grows longer], Hey! I got a big nose too! Nose fight! En garde! ,[hits Plankton with his long nose],
,[Patrick and Plankton engage a nose sword fight and the kids cheer. Plankton hits Patrick and makes him knock over a table. The triple gooberberry sunrise sundae flies into the Goofy Goober waiter's face. He is covered in ice cream.],
,Children:, Uh-oh.
,Goofy Goober waiter:, Hooray!
,[The kids, Goofy Goober, and Patrick cheer. Patrick and Plankton resume their nose sword fight. Plankton pokes Patrick's butt with his nose and sends him rolling towards the counter. Patrick crashes into the counter and splatters ice cream all over the place. The Goofy Goober waiter is covered in ice cream and looks like a snowman.],
,Children:, Uh-oh.
,[The ice cream melts off of the Goofy Goober waiter. He looks down and sees Patrick and Plankton.],
,Patrick and Plankton:, Sorry.
,[The Goofy Goober waiter is really angry and his ice cream cone pupils melt in fury. He kicks Patrick and Plankton out, sending them flying into the street. Patrick and Plankton fall on their noses and they break off.],
,Plankton:, Time to let your conscience be your guide. Give me that list! ,[goes into Patrick's bellybutton, grabs the list, crosses out everything and writes something down], Here! ,[gives Patrick the list],
,Patrick:, Hey, only one errand left! ,[leans back and forth and plays his air guitar], Gotta give Plankton a Krabby Patty! ,[fireworks explode above him],
,Plankton:, ,[shakes his hat off, waves his blond hair and plays his air guitar], Oh, yeah! Yeah!
,[The scene changes to Patrick and Plankton arriving at the Chum Bucket with a Krabby Patty.],
,Patrick:, I wonder why I wanted to give Plankton a patty?
,Plankton:, Why not Plankton? He's a sweetheart. ,[his nose grows long and Plankton clips it off], And as your conscience, I demand you toss that patty in the mail slot!
,Patrick:, Oh, I love mail slot toss! ,[attempts to throw the patty in the mail slot, but he misses as it bounces upwards],
,Plankton:, Not so hard! ,[slaps Patrick], Huh? ,[sees the patty land on Pearl's picnic basket who is going to the beach with her friends],
,Pearl:, I've been wanting to hit the beach all week. ,[laughs],
,Pearl and her friends:, Goo Lagoon! Goo Lagoon! ,[drive away to Goo Lagoon],
,Plankton:, Huh? ,[his mouth falls in shock; Plankton forms another idea and a lightbulb lights up above his head. He pastes his mouth back on], Ah-ha! Patrick, please promptly pursue Plankton's patty! ,[points to lightbulb], Get the idea?
,Patrick:, Uh, uh. ,[strains himself as a lightbulb appears on his head; but it burns out and Patrick drolls],
,[Plankton groans, grabs a ladder, and climbs up to Patrick's head.],
,Plankton:, How many plankton does it take to change a lightbulb? ,[unscrews the burnt lightbulb and replaces it with a new one], One. ,[climbs down, pulls Patrick's tooth and the lightbulb lights],
,Patrick:, ,[wakes up], Huh? Now I get the idea! Whoo! ,[waves his arm around again], Gotta follow that patty!
,[Patrick runs off to follow Pearl and her friends to Goo Lagoon. Plankton is trampled by Patrick's feet and gets up.],
,Plankton:, Wait for me, you pink pinhead! ,[gets blown away by the wind],
,[The scene changes to Goo Lagoon. Pearl lays by to rest in the sun. Patrick and Plankton arrive by digging under the sand. They tunnel past several beach goers along the way. They hit Tyler's beach umbrella. They hit Fred.],
,Fred:, Ow! Hey, watch it!
,[They hit another beach goer who is sipping a drink. Plankton pops out of the sand and spit some of it out. Patrick pops out of the sand and spits out a volley ball. Pearl nearly sucks her umbrella in her mouth while she sleeps.],
,Plankton:, There's Blubber Mouth.
,[Pearl sucks the umbrella in her mouth and swallow it in her sleep.],
,Patrick:, There's Plankton's patty!
,Plankton:, You know what to do.
,Patrick:, Do I? ,[gets slapped by Plankton], Oh yeah!
,[Patrick digs towards Pearl and goes to grab the patty. The patty falls off the picnic roll into Pearl's mouth. Plankton escapes and falls on the sand. But Pearl has swallowed the patty whole.],
,Plankton:, ,[groans], Oh, well. No patty for Plankton. ,[sobs],
,Patrick:, Huh! I'm going in! Hi-yah! ,[jumps into Pearl's mouth and goes down her throat],
,Plankton:, Ugh. Just being near a whale's mouth gives me the creeps. ,[gets and pulled into Pearl's mouth by Patrick; Patrick and Plankton fall deep down Pearl's throat and Patrick screams], Quiet, you fool! You'll wake up Pearl.
,[Patrick and Plankton land in Pearl's stomach. Pearl feels a bit of painfulness and goes back to sleep. Patrick gets scared and cowers in fear.],
,Patrick:, This is snug.
,Plankton:, Mother always said I'd end up in a whale's belly. Or prison.
,Geppetto:, Hey! Who-a goes-a there?
,Patrick:, Who goes where?
,Geppetto:, ,[comes out from his tent], The name's-a Geppetto. Take off your hats and stay a while.
,Plankton:, We don't have time for a visit, old man. We're just trying to find a sandwich.
,Geppetto:, Sandwich? No, I haven't seen anything like that around-a here in months. ,[his nose grows],
,Patrick:, Hey, Geppetto, what's that behind your back?
,Plankton:, Is that our Krabby Patty?
,Geppetto:, Nope. ,[his nose grows longer], Oh! ,[punches his nose back in his face],
,Plankton:, ,[jumps on Geppetto's shoulder and grabs the patty], Ah-ha! I got the patty!
,Patrick:, ,[grabs Geppetto's wig], Ah-ha! I got the wig! ,[puts it on his head],
,Geppetto:, ,[goes in his tent], Son, they're-a stealing our food!
,[Geppetto pulls out an unfinished wooden puppet he calls Pinocchio.],
,Pinocchio:, Who's stealing our food, Pop? Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!
,[Patrick and Plankton look at each other in puzzlement.],
,Geppetto:, Get 'em, Pinocchio!
,[Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio get into a brawl. Geppetto ties Plankton and Patrick in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all get tangled up in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all play jump rope like children. They stop and resume their brawl. Their fighting causes Pearl to get a horrible taste of indigestion and her stomach growls in pain.],
,Pearl:, Oh, no. A stomach ache at the beach? That's no fun! I wish it would go away.
,[Karen magically appears next to Pearl.],
,Karen:, Your wish is granted. Hold out your hand! ,[waves her wand and poof up a bottle of Gush and Flush stomach reliever],
,Pearl:, Wow! What is this?
,Karen:, For fast relief of indigestion, try Gush and Flush. And wash your pain down the drain. ,[whispers], And my stupid husband, while you're at it.
,Pearl:, ,[drinks the stomach reliever], Ah.
,[Pearl's stomach growls. Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio continue to fight until they get caught in a torrent of stomach reliever. Pearl blasts the stomach reliever out from her blowhole, sending Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio out of her body.],
,Pearl:, Thank you, Extra Strength Gush and Flush! ,[giggles and winks],
,Geppetto:, Pinocchio, we're-a free-a! Free-a!
,[Pinocchio waves his arm around while Geppetto sings his heart out. Suddenly, a giant clam comes out and swallows them both.],
,Plankton:, Huh? ,[gets up], Don't worry about the patty, Patrick. I'll take it to Plankton myself, like a good little conscience. ,[picks up the patty], See ya!
,[Plankton goes to return to the Chum Bucket with the patty, but bumps into a small yellow starfish who turns out to be Patrick's real conscience.],
,Patrick's conscience:, Oh, uh, hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Eh, my conscience?
,Plankton:, Your wha?
,Patrick's conscience:, Yep, I'm Patrick's conscience. But I overslept.
,Patrick:, Well, if you're my conscience conscience, then who's that?
,Patrick's conscience:, It's a bug! Step on it!
,[Patrick rapidly steps on Plankton with his foot.],
,Karen:, And they all lived happily ever after. So, until next time, this is—
,Plankton:, Karen!
,Karen:, The Computer Fairy hoping all your dreams come true.
,[Karen waves her wand and her screen goes back to the storybook. The last page says ""All Your Dreams Come True"" on it. The scene zooms in Karen's screen to go to the storybook.],
,Pinocchio:, ,[appears on screen], Let me at 'em, Pop! Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em! Let me—
,[The book closes onto Pinocchio and the cover says the title, ""The End"" on it.],
,Pinocchio:, Ow.

,SpongeBob:, Patrick, those are hash browns.
,Patrick:, Hash browns! ,[engulfs the hash browns in his mouth],
,SpongeBob:, Um, Patrick, the slides.

,Patrick:, Please, no interruptions.
,SpongeBob:, Sorry.
,Patrick:, As I was saying... ,[clears throat], I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door. ,[Flashback. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick's rock and knocks on it. Patrick moans], For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet? ,[grunts. Opens his rock with a key. SpongeBob jumps inside and sees Patrick laying on the floor with the key in his hand],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?
,Patrick:, ,[panting], I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest! I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life. ,[breathlessly], It's so exhausting. ,[cries], Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me.
,SpongeBob:, Pal, what you need is a vacation.
,Patrick:, That's it! I need a vacation! ,[cut to Bikini Travel Agency],
,Travel Agent:, So, you'd like a vacation.
,Patrick:, ,[gasps], Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--
,SpongeBob:, ,[covers Patrick's mouth], Yes, he'd like a vacation.
,Travel Agent:, Well, your options are endless, Mr. Star. Anywhere from beautiful white sandy beaches to exhilarating jungle safaris. It all depends on your budget. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick stare at him. They get booted out],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Ugh!
,Patrick:, I guess I'll just have to stay home.
,SpongeBob:, ""Stay home""? That's it! You can take a ""stay-cation.""
,Patrick:, Wh-what's that?
,SpongeBob:, Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free.
,Patrick:, Oh, boy! ,[cut to later at Patrick's house],
,SpongeBob:, All right, Patrick. Enjoy your stay-cation.
,Patrick:, That's what I'm gonna do, buddy. ,[goes into his rock and walks up to a check in counter],

,SpongeBob:, Follow me, sir. Your room is right this way. ,[opens a door that leads to a bedroom], Your room, sir.
,Patrick:, Oh, dear.
,SpongeBob:, Something wrong, Mr. Star?
,Patrick:, Well, um, honestly, I'm not sure I like the way this room is arranged.
,SpongeBob:, Arranged?
,Narrator:, One Hour Later.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Star, are you sure about this? ,[standing on top of all the furniture in a pile],
,Patrick:, No, I--uh, maybe it's the walls. ,[SpongeBob deflates and all the furniture crashes into a pile of sand], I got it. Let's put the room back the way it was originally!
,SpongeBob:, ,[talking about a bathtub full of water], The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features.
,Patrick:, Ah a pool! ,[rips off shorts, revealing a black speedo, and walks over to the tub], Where's the diving board?
,SpongeBob:, The diving board? Ooh, one diving board, coming up. ,[runs off and puts together a wooden diving board], Your diving board, sir.
,Patrick:, All right! ,[laughs and gets on the diving board and does a few flips in the air and hits the bathtub with his head, and then flips into the water],
,SpongeBob:, You okay, sir?
,Patrick:, ,[confused], My head is swimming just fine, thank you.

,Patrick:, ,[teeth chattering], So cold.
,SpongeBob:, This calls for CPR—candy peppermint resuscitation.
,Patrick:, So weak. ,[SpongeBob sticks the candy peppermint in Patrick' mouth], Strength... returning. ,[licks more of the peppermint. His tummy is rumbling], But I'm still hungry.
,SpongeBob:, Follow me, sir. ,[now outside, SpongeBob is dressed as a waiter and puts out a table and a giant rock. He drops the giant rock on his foot which causes it to throb and then deflate], If you would take your seat, sir. ,[Patrick sits down.

,Patrick:, Wow. What luxury. ,[SpongeBob, now dressed as a chef, wheels a bbq pit over and gets out a spatula and patty],
,SpongeBob:, One Krabby Patty coming up.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[clears throat. SpongeBob gives him a dollar], What, no tip?,[SpongeBob hands him some coins],
,Patrick:, Hey, what kind of resort is this? Where's the entertainment?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir. ,[jumps on the table], Presenting the SpongeBob Follies! ,[vocalizes music while dancing], What the hey.

,Man:, Three, two, one, liftoff. ,[SpongeBob shoots the pineapple out of his head and into an airplane's turbine, slicing the pineapple's skin off and cutting it into little parts, and back down onto the table],
,SpongeBob:, Well, what do you think?
,Patrick:, You are smokin'!
,SpongeBob:, Aw, it was nothing.
,Patrick:, No, no, you're really smoking!
,SpongeBob:, What? ,[sniffs and sees the patty is burning], Oh, no, the Krabby Patty! ,[the black smoke fills up around him and Patrick. Patrick exits through the back and his tummy is rumbling again],
,Patrick:, My tummy is still lonely. ,[sniffs the aroma in the air], Ahh.,[sees the aroma is coming from behind Squidward's kitchen where he is making some sort of stew],
,Squidward:, ,[sinffs the stew], Ah. ,[licks some more], Ah, delish. ,[brings a bowl of stew to the table], Oh, silly me. I forgot the napkin. ,[walks off to get it from the cabinet], And now an elegant meal for an elegant person. ,[walks back to the table to see Patrick eating his stew],
,Patrick:, I am quite refined. ,[slurps the rest of the bowl], Ah! ,[burps],
,Squidward:, What are you doing here?
,Patrick:, I'm on vacation! The last resort I was staying at was a dump, but this place is awesome. Oh, hey, waiter... ,[snaps], a napkin, please. ,[Squidward growls],
,SpongeBob:, ,[coming out of the black smoke with a burnt patty on a plate], Mr. Star, your meal is ready. ,[Krabby Patty dissolves into dust and blown away by the wind], Patrick, where is he? ,[Squidward screams], Ah!
,Squidward:, Patrick, you dimwitted moron, get out of my kitchen!
,Patrick:, Good idea. I think I'll head over to the spa. ,[bones crack], I could use a massage.
,Squidward:, Get this into your tiny, tiny, little, tiny brain—this is not a resort. It's my house. There is no spa. And you can't get a massage!
,Patrick:, ,[moaning], Oh, yeah, that's the spot. ,[SpongeBob is giving him a massage], Hey, you should get a massage, too.
,Squidward:, ,[scoffs], Not likely. ,[bones crack], Ow ow ow ow! What the hey?! ,[pushes Patrick off the table], Move over. I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet.

,[Squidward is sleeping and SpongeBob is tired out],
,SpongeBob:, So tired. ,[goes into his house and gets into bed. Sighs but notices snoring is coming from Patrick], Patrick, what are you doing here?
,Patrick:, That resort next door is too crowded. Then I found this place. It's quiet and peaceful. Good night, SpongeBob. ,[snores. Cut to Mr. Krabs gargling in front of his sink. Goes into his room, turns on the light, and sees SpongeBob in his hammock, snoring],

,SpongeBob:, Cowboy. Great choice.
,Patrick:, No, no, no, no, no! ,[points to the horse pop out], That.

,Sandy:, Thank you. And the horse you rode in on?
,SpongeBob:, ,[passes by a street cleaner], Morning, old timer.
,[Patrick farts and the street cleaner moans. He grabs a broom and pooper scooper and goes after them. Patrick gallops over to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob gets off and ties Patrick to the pole. Moments later, kids come by and see Patrick as a horse.],

,SpongeBob:, Sure, but be gentle.
,[The kids run over and gently pet Patrick. Patrick sighs heavenly and neighs.],
,Kid #2:, He's so soft.
,Squidward:, What's all the hubbub out here? ,[the kids gasps], What the? ,[laughs], So Patrick's a horse now? Ha-ha! Your phony baloney pony's more like an old gray mare. ,[snorts], Sorry to say, but, uh, this one's ready for the glue factory. ,[slaps Patrick's butt],

,Kids:, ,[runs over to Patrick and continues to pet him], Aw... He's really fuzzy.
,[Mr. Krabs sees the kids in the form of dollars as they are petting Patrick. Then, in an instant, he comes up with an idea.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! Horsey rides! Kids love horseys. Great idea having Patrick play pony. I'll charge these kids ten bucks a ride and cash in big time!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I don't know, Mr. Krabs, I think Patrick will only let me ride him.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[draws a sign and chuckles], Oh, nonsense. Pony rides! Ten buckaroos!
,[Many kids show up for the ""pony ride."" Squidward pops out of SpongeBob's head. The scene changes to SpongeBob flipping patties on the grill. The patties are shaped into Patrick, as a horse, giving SpongeBob a ride on his back.],

,Mr. Krabs:, ,[chuckles], Four at a time quadruplicates me money. Let's try for five. ,[takes a kid's money and chuckles],
,[Mr. Krabs puts another kid on Patrick's back. Patrick gets really angry and shakes the kids off his back.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-oh. ,[catches a kid], Ooh. ,[catches another], Oh! ,[catches another], Ooh. ,[catches another with his teeth],

It's me. ,[Patrick neighs], Your old pal, SpongeBob. ,[eats an apple, but also eats his hands], Remember? ,[Patrick chuffs; he and SpongeBob circle around], Okay... Would you like me to whisper? ,[Patrick neighs], Nice Patrick. Pretty Patrick. Good Patrick. ,[takes out a rope and lassos it on Patrick's neck; Patrick struggles to break free], Calm down, buddy. I don't want to lose you again. ,[Patrick rears up, neighs, and flips SpongeBob backwards], Whoa! Ow! Ow!
,[Patrick runs over a cactus field and SpongeBob gets pricked by the needles. Patrick runs over a pointy rock field and SpongeBob gets scratched by the rocks. Patrick runs over a pillow field, but the pillows don't seem to harm SpongeBob. Patrick stops running and SpongeBob swings around and around as the rope tangles Patrick's neck. SpongeBob lands on Patrick's back and the rope falls off. Patrick neighs and licks SpongeBob in the face.],
,SpongeBob:, Aw. And all this time, I thought I was the one breaking you, but you were the one breaking me. ,[breaks into pieces, puts himself back together, and clicks his tongue], Patrick horsey, giddy up!
,[Patrick gallops across the desert with SpongeBob on his back. He jumps over several cliffs and gallops across a canyon. While Patrick is galloping, SpongeBob is seen playing jump rope on his back.

,SpongeBob:, What?
,Squidward:, Oh, this is humiliating.

,Mr. Krabs:, Now look at your old pile of dog food. ,[laughs],
,[Patrick looks hideous.],
,SpongeBob:, I'd put my pile of dog food up against your stud any day!
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, yeah? How 'bout a race, then? ,[holds out two delivery bags], First one to delivery a Krabby Patty to Black Devil Bay wins.
,SpongeBob:, You're on! ,[grabs the bag],
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick and SpongeBob getting ready for the ""race."" Sandy acts as the referee.],
,Sandy:, I want a clean race. No cheating! Wait for the bell. ,[rings the bell and the racers begin their race], Ah! ,[spins around and feels dizzy],
,[The street cleaner follows the racers. As Squidward gallops, he leaves behind a cloud of dust.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha, ha! Eat my dust!
,SpongeBob:, Well, okay. ,[carves a piece of the cloud dust and eats it], Mmm. ,[carves some more and eats them], Mmm. Hey, your dust was delicious!
,[Patrick neighs and runs to catch up. Mr. Krabs, who is not going to play fair, cheats by making a shortcut sign in hopes of getting SpongeBob and Patrick lost.],
,Mr. Krabs:, This shortcut sign should send SpongeBob and Patrick far from the finish line. ,[puts the shortcut sign near the tall grass and hops on Squidward's back], Hi-ho, Squidward! ,[gallops away],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa! Whoa, shortcut. This could be a trick. I love tricks!
,[Patrick gallops through the tall grass and grazes a path for them to walk on. However, the tall grass also leads to a cliff, which sends SpongeBob and Patrick falling on top of Mr. Krabs and Squidward. Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob and Patrick away and cackles evilly. Patrick catches up and runs on his legs.],
,SpongeBob:, Whoa, whoa! ,[screams as Patrick runs up farther than Mr. Krabs and Squidward], Hyah! Oh, boy, we're ahead!
,Mr. Krabs:, No, you're actually behind! ,[cackles],
,SpongeBob:, Oh... ,[sees Patrick running on a treadmill with a moving projector as background], Huh? Whoa, Patrick. Whoa.
,[Patrick slips and rolls under the treadmill, which sends them flying in front of Mr. Krabs and Squidward. Mr. Krabs pulls out a slingshot and shots a rock onto SpongeBob. But the rock rolls around SpongeBob's body and shots back at Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gets hit by the rock], Oh! ,[runs in front of SpongeBob and Patrick and takes out a bottle of mustard], Have some slippery mustard, slowpokes! ,[sprits mustard on the ground, which almost makes Patrick slip; Patrick tastes some of the mustard], That was extra spicy slippery mustard! ,[laughs, but Patrick blows fire out of his mouth, making them fly past Mr. Krabs and Squidward], Oh, ratfish! ,[gets another idea], I've got one more trick up me sleeve. ,[Patrick and SpongeBob continue to gallop, but Mr. Krabs catches up and appears in a police officer while Squidward acts as a police car], This is the police! I'm pulling you over for speeding!
,Officer John Slugfish:, No, this is the police! I'm pulling you over for impersonating an officer!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick gallop all the way over to Black Devil Bay, where their customer, an orange angler fish, is waiting for his delivery.],
,SpongeBob:, Here's your delivery, sir.
,[The angler fish takes the bag and looks inside it. However, there was nothing inside it and he shakes the bag.],
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Patrick:, ,[spits out his reins], I was hungry.
,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward show up and gives the angler fish the bag. The angler fish eats the Krabby Patty, lights his green light, and leaves.],
,Mr. Krabs:, We win! We win! ,[laughs and jumps off of Squidward's back], I—I had the best horsey! I had the best horsey!
,Patrick:, ,[rears up], I don't want to be a horse anymore.
,SpongeBob:, ,[slides off of Patrick's back], Okay, buddy, but remember, you can still be anything.
,Patrick:, ,[takes off the saddle], In that case, I think I'll be... ,[appears to have Mr. Krabs' claws as arms], a crab! Ark, ark, ark, ark, ark, ark! ,[leaves],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[gasps as he sees his claws gone], Oh, no, you don't! Come back here with me claws! ,[runs after Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sighs], How 'bout a ride back to the old Krusty Krab, cowboy? ,[puts on the saddle and bends down],
,[Squidward sighs and climbs onto SpongeBob's back. SpongeBob rears up and neighs like a horse. He gallops away into the sunset with Squidward on his back. The street cleaner follows them as the episode ends.],

"[Squidward is sleeping and hears noises. He awakens, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick under his blanket with a sign that reads ""happy birthday""],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, Surprise! Happy birthday, Squidward! ,[all three standing in front of a cake], Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday cake! ,[standing in front of a picture of a seahorse and Squidward has the tail], Happy happy birthday! Pin the tail on the seahorse! ,[surrounded by presents], Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday, Squidward! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick run out of Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
,Patrick:, Another year older. ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, It's not my birthday! ,[shuts door and takes off party hat], That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!
,Realtor Lady:, ,[looking at a picture of Squidward's house], Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles! ,[showing the Realtor lady as Patty Rechid from Bikini Realty on phone], I can sell your home in a heartbeat.
,Squidward:, Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
,Patty:, No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.
,Squidward:, Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say ""neighbors?""
,Patty:, Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.
,Squidward:, Neighbors. Uhh...
,Patty:, Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then! ,[both hang up],
,Squidward:, SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite... ,[Later, SpongeBob is sleeping, but is awaken from Squidward's instrument playing outside],
,SpongeBob:, Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum? ,[Squidward stops playing],
,Squidward:, Drum? What drum? ,[puts the drum on the ground and punches a hole in it], This is just my wig case! See? ,[puts on the wig, kicks the drum out of the way and frolics around], Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!
,SpongeBob:, Squidward! You need bed rest! ,[pushes Squidward to his house as Squidward is blowing bubbles], I'll keep you safe until you're well again.
,Squidward:, Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Wednesday?
,Squidward:, Why, it's Opposite Day! ,[SpongeBob is confused], You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!
,SpongeBob:, Does everybody know about Opposite Day?
,Squidward:, Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, a game.
,Squidward:, Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?
,SpongeBob:, Quiet and out of the way! Yay!
,Squidward:, Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.
,SpongeBob:, I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day. ,[giggles as he runs back into his pineapple], I'm not ready!
,Squidward:, So long, chum. ,[takes off wig], And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
,SpongeBob:, ,[running to Gary], Gary! It's Opposite Day and I... ,[stops running], ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day. ,[crawls into bed], Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?
,Gary:, Meow!
,SpongeBob:, Gary, where’s your holiday spirit?
,Gary:, ,[barks like a dog],
,SpongeBob:, ,[doorbell rings], Company! I hate company. Who's there?
,Patrick:, It's Patrick!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again! ,[giggles, but Patrick cries],
,Patrick:, ,[sobbing], SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens door], That's right! You're my worst enemy! ,[Patrick falls to the ground, bawling], Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!
,Patrick:, Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!
,SpongeBob:, You have?
,Patrick:, No! What is it?
,SpongeBob:, Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.
,Patrick:, Oh! Let me try! Let me try! ,[Patrick holds his breath and turns purple],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick! Patrick, breathe! ,[He takes a deep breath in and pants], Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the ,wrong, way!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick dance across the screen as SpongeBob is pink and Patrick is yellow. Gary eats properly from a table],
,SpongeBob:,  ,[eats from Gary's bowl], Meow.
,Patrick:, ,[sitting on newspapers], Meow.
,[SpongeBob and Patrick both blow a bubble, but they blow themselves into bubbles, instead. Patrick pops],
,SpongeBob:, Kcirtap yeh. ,[forwards: Hey Patrick.],
,Patrick:, Pu evig i. ,[forwards: I give up.],
,SpongeBob:, Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot! ,[forwards: To get to the opposite side.],
,[Both laugh in reverse. Cut back to house],
,SpongeBob:, Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?
,Patrick:, Nope. ,[He smiles, both laugh],
,Squidward:, Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob! ,[packing his belongings into boxes], I'm almost sorry I'm leaving! ,[laughs], Opposite Day. ,[hears noises from outside], SpongeBob, what are you... ,[screams as he sees both SpongeBob and Patrick destroying SpongeBob's pineapple],
,SpongeBob:, Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day... ,[giggles], ...terrible? ,[laughs],
,Squidward:, I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!
,SpongeBob:, Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me! ,[Squidward facepalms],
,Squidward:, ,[panicked], If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick look at the destroyed pineapple],
,Patrick:, Isn't it beautiful?
,SpongeBob:, On Opposite Day it is. ,[Squidward drives up with a bulldozer],
,Squidward:, Out of the way, SpongeBob! ,[Squidward begins to rebuild the pineapple],
,SpongeBob:, I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, ,[he wraps his arms around himself repeatedly], but that really means he's messing it up. ,[Patrick is drooling], But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, ,[Gary meows], Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob! ,[SpongeBob wrapped his arms around himself], A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being... ,[stretches his nose out and puts his belt around the middle of his head to resemble Squidward's head and talks like Squidward], Squidward!
,Patrick:, Hey! I wanna be opposite, too! ,[SpongeBob thinks, then snaps his fingers. He takes a piece of coral and puts it below Patrick's eyes where his nose would be], Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo! ,[dances], I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite... ,[talking like Squidward], ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better. ,[normal voice again], Now you try.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[takes a deep breath and continues dancing], I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward. ,[SpongeBob dances along with Patrick],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
,SpongeBob:, ,[opens door for Patrick], After you, Mr. Squidward.
,Patrick:, Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward. ,[walks in],
,SpongeBob:, You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward. ,[walks in and shuts the door],
,Squidward:, ,[still rebuilding SpongeBob's pineapple], Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be ""Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!"" ,[as he is building, Patty Rechid drives up],
,Patty:, Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person! ,[walks up to the front door, knocks on the door. SpongeBob opens it], Hello, Mr... ,[looks down], Uh... Mr. Tentacles?
,SpongeBob:, ,[talking like Squidward], Yes, please come in.
,Patty:, It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, everyone says that.
,Patty:, Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.
,SpongeBob:, ,[normal voice], Positive things! Opposite Day... ,[talking like Squidward], I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.
,Patty:, Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.
,SpongeBob:, Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard! ,[Patty looks at him, shocked], Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?
,Patty:, Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...
,SpongeBob:, Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer. ,[laughs then stops], Please follow me. ,[both walk into Squidward's art room], And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.
,Patty:, ,[looks at painting of Squidward], Oh my, this painting is very nice. ,[Patrick bursts through the painting],
,Patrick:, Thank you! ,[Patty screams and leaps up to the ceiling, hanging onto a beam],
,Patty:, Who's that?!
,SpongeBob:, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
,Patty:, You're both Squidward?
,SpongeBob:, I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, We're both Squidward.
,Squidward:, Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet. ,[sees Patty's boat and screams], NO! ,[SpongeBob plays Squidward's clarinet badly for Patty],
,Patty:, Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[plays more],
,Patty:, I really don't want to hear more, thank you.
,SpongeBob:, I hear you loud and clear. ,[plays more],
,Squidward:, ,[bursts in], Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two ,[turns to them], barnacle heads ,[turns back to Patty], haven't harmed you in any way.
,Patty:, Who are you?
,Squidward:, Why, I'm Squidward! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick pop up in the background. Patty's face slowly turns angry],
,Patty:, ,[stands up from chair], What kind of fool do you take me for?! ,[to Patrick], He's Squidward, ,[to SpongeBob], he's Squidward, ,[to the real Squidward], ,you're, Squidward?! ,I'm, Squidward!! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?!!
,Gary:, ,[with a pickle on his face. Imitates Squidward's voice], Meow.
,Patty:, ,[shocked then angry], I'm outta here. ,[she walks away],
,Squidward:, Ma'am, please! What about my house?!
,Patty:, I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on earth!!! ,[walks out of the house],
,Squidward:, Wait!
,SpongeBob:, Don't...
,Patrick:, ...Go!
,Squidward:, ,[screams, runs out, and holds onto her leg, dragging him, as she is leaving], No, no, no, no, no!
,Patty:, Stop! Stop!
,Squidward:, Please, sell my house!
,Patty:, ,Never!!!, ,[releases her leg, gets in her boat],
,Squidward:, Don't leave me here! ,[falls to the ground, crying. Patty drives off],
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, ,[happily walk up to Squidward], Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you! ,[Squidward seethes with fury, then gets an idea],
,Squidward:, Let me show you guys how much I... hate you! ,[Squidward drives up with the bulldozer chasing SpongeBob and Patrick, they both scream and run away],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?
,Squidward:, ,[angry, still chasing them], Happy Opposite Day! ,[chases them down the street and laughs evilly],

,Patrick:, I don't know. ,[his stomach turns into different shapes and sizes], What's happening to me?
,SpongeBob:, I think I can explain. ,[lifts up Patrick's belly], Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes.

,Potty:, No.
,Patchy:, Uh, Rusty Hinges and the Boys from the Brig?
,Potty:, They broke up years ago.
,Patchy:, Well, who else is there?
,Potty:, The Bird Brains!
,Patchy:, Oh.. ,[laughs, but then chuckles in confusion],
,Potty:, The Bird Brains--They're better than all those other bands.
,Patchy:, But they're just a bunch of birds.
,Lead Singer:, Hello, Encino! ,[The Bird Brains begin playing heavy metal music],
,Patchy:, Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ohh! ,[A blast of heavy metal rock music sends a screaming Patchy flying backwards out of the house, blasting him through six more houses before slamming face-first into a metal telephone pole. Back at the party, the band continues to play; Patchy enters his house while covered with debris], No, no, No! Stop the music! ,[yells as he runs to the band and the music stops], Stop! Look, boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time! I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.
,Lead Singer:, You mean we're fired?
,Patchy:, No. ,[Patchy and the band go to the plank.], Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! Ha, ha, ha... ,[laughs, the birds just fly away], No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh! ,[breaks down sobbing],
,Narrator:, ,[screen: PLEASE STAND BY], While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up. ,[shows SpongeBob's house decorated],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come! ,[looks at his watch], Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00. ,[gasps], Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed! ,[cries], No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever! ,[doorbell rings], Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late. ,[opens door to see Patrick],
,Patrick:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?
,Patrick:, Sure? ,[SpongeBob runs over and pours a glass],
,SpongeBob:, Did you have any trouble finding the place? ,[gives Patrick the glass], Here you are!
,Patrick:, Thanks. ,[drinks some punch],
,SpongeBob:, So, the punch okay?
,Patrick:, Not bad, not bad.
,SpongeBob:, Hmm, nice weather we're having.
,Patrick:, It's been very mild, yes.
,SpongeBob:, Yep, it's mild season. ,[nervously laughs], Ahem. So, you read any... ,[doorbell rings], Oh, more party guests! ,[Mr. Krabs has walked in with a purple coat on], Welcome, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahoy, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't mind if I do! ,[drops his coat on Gary. Gary sticks his eyes out of the sleeves],
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks over his party list], Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot... ,[hands Patrick and Mr. Krabs name tags], These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions. ,[doorbell rings], Oh, more guests! ,[Patrick tries to read his name tag upside down],
,Patrick:, Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, you dumb bunny, it says, ""Hello, my name is Patrick.""
,Patrick:, ,[shakes Mr Krabs' hand], Nice to meet you Patrick.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Good one, Patrick! ,[both laugh],
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick. ,[doorbell rings],
,Patrick:, Was he talking to me or you? ,[SpongeBob opens door to Squidward],
,SpongeBob:, Squidward, you made it!
,Squidward:, My cable's out.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that. ,[SpongeBob hides some wire cutters behind his back],
,Mr Krabs:, So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?
,Squidward:, Not bad.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob clears his throat, attracting Mr. Krabs and Squidward's attention], I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47. ,[erases something on his clipboard and clicks his tongue], But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter. ,[SpongeBob takes Scooter and places him near Squidward], Here are some topic cards to break the ice. ,[hands them some cards. The doorbell rings], Oh, someone's at the door!
,Scooter:, Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!
,Squidward:, This is lame. ,[Squidward throws away his card and walks away],
,Unnamed Character:, My card says, ""Discuss the philosophical nature of irony."" What does yours say?
,Patrick:, ""Nod politely."" ,[shown Mr. Krabs and Plankton with cards],
,Mr. Krabs:, What does yours say, Plankton?
,Plankton:, Oh, uh, it says, ,[really shows ""Where are You From?""], 'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.' ,[clears throat], How interesting.
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice try, Plankton. ,[everyone is chattering amongst themselves. The doorbell rings],
,SpongeBob:, ,[he is looking angrily at his watch and tapping his foot and the doorbell rings], Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive... ,[looks at his watch], 22 minutes late! ,[opens up the door to Tom Smith],
,Tom:, Hey, hey! ,[SpongeBob folds his arms in a sort of anger. Tom laughs nervously holding a bag of chips as SpongeBob walks into the party],
,SpongeBob:, Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position! ,[silence. everyone claps silently], As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me! ,[laughs as he walks into a room with a sign that reads 'Coat Check', but ducks back out with a serious look], Seriously. ,[closes door],
,Narrator:, ,(television version only), That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages. ,[fades out and back in], ,[Patchy is shown dancing and a guy in a submarine outfit walks towards the camera], Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!
,SpongeBob:, ,[scene cuts to his wardrobe], Hey, Gare, got another coat for you. ,[throws the coat on Gary], The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to ,[uses air quotes], work. ,[cackles and walks back out with his clipboard], Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here? ,[guests are talking and dancing to the music. SpongeBob starts to hyperventilate], This is all wrong! What's happening to my party? ,[scene cuts to Sandy and Larry dancing], No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! ,10:00pm!, ,[scene cuts to Sandals eating cake. SpongeBob takes a vacuum and sucks out all the food from his mouth], Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52! ,[switches into 'blower.' Slice of cake is blown perfectly back into the rest of the cake. A plate with bacon and eggs is blown onto the table], Hey, what's this?
,Sandals:, That's my breakfast!
,SpongeBob:, Could I have everyone's attention please? ,[Patrick is dancing by the record player], Patrick! ,[stops the music], If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks. ,[the guests walk over to the couch], Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means! ,[gets out a newspaper], Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this! ,[guests cheer], This is yesterday's paper. ,[they stop cheering as SpongeBob walks outside], I'll just go grab today's paper. ,[everyone starts to party when he leaves. talking to himself], SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you? ,[tries to open the door], Locked out? ,[knocks on the door. Scene cuts to Patrick and Sandy are dancing],
,Sandy:, This song's got a great beat.
,Patrick:, Yeah. Knock, knock.
,SpongeBob:, Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me? ,[looks through the window and his eyes bug out as he wails. He sees the party, with all the guests dancing and having fun and the music blasting], Oh no! ,[cut to the topic cards on the floor and two fish just talking], They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing! ,[cut to Patrick eating all the deviled eggs in the piñata in one gulp and everyone else cheering him on], Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs! ,[scene cuts to two guests laughing], Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it. ,[scene cuts to Patrick and Mrs. Puff talking],
,Patrick:, So, do you come here often?
,Mrs. Puff:, No. ,[phone rings. Patrick answers],
,Patrick:, Hello, SquarePants residence. What? ,[covers one ear], I'm sorry, what? ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob using a pay phone outside, across the street],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, You wanna talk to SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Yes... no, Patrick! ,I'm, SpongeBob! I'm outside!
,Patrick:, Okay, hold on. ,[opens door], SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!
,SpongeBob:, What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait! ,[SpongeBob runs toward the door.],
,Patrick:, Sorry, he's not out there. ,[Patrick closes it in front of him before he gets inside],
,Scooter:, Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.
,Patrick:, Thanks. ,[Patrick hands the phone to an ice sculpture of SpongeBob's head], Here you go, SpongeBob. ,[drops the phone in the punch],
,SpongeBob:, Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! ,[looks up noticing the bathroom window is open. Scene cuts to Larry looking in the window],
,Larry:, Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat! ,[the mirror shows a real lobster on a plate], Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind. ,[looks through the medicine cabinet. He finds a comb with three angles and teeth coming out from them], Hey, check out his crazy comb.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet. ,[climbs up the side of his house], I hope they don't touch my special comb.
,Larry:, Well, I think I've aired it up enough. ,[Larry closes the window on SpongeBob's fingers. SpongeBob falls down screaming. Larry hears the screams], Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob lands flat on the ground then gets up and looks at his broken fingers], I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events! ,[scene cuts to inside where Pearl and Mrs Puff talking to each other],
,Pearl:, Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely. ,[sees SpongeBob spying through the window], Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings. ,[turns the window around],
,SpongeBob:, I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in! ,[takes a shovel and digs. Digs up into the middle of the party], Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned. ,[guests are hopping around the room. They hop on SpongeBob and send him through the hole he dug], I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but... ,[now wearing a bunny suit], ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in! ,[takes a pick-ax to cut the door but a bright light shines at him],
,Officer John:, Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?
,Officer O'Malley:, I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.
,Officer John:, You criminals make me sick.
,SpongeBob:, I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!
,Officer John:, ,[smiles], Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!
,Officer O'Malley:, You have a nice party now, sir. ,[both walk off],
,SpongeBob:, Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.
,Officer John:, Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?
,SpongeBob:, ,[stammer-like], But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.
,Officer O'Malley:, Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge. ,[handcuffs SpongeBob but the handcuffs are not working], Oh no, these cuffs are broken.
,Officer John:, Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.
,[bubble transition to Officers John and O'Malley taking SpongeBob to jail in a pillory],
,SpongeBob:, Is it too late to offer you some punch?
,Officer O'Malley:, Sir, you have the right to remain silent. ,[scene cuts to next day],
,SpongeBob:, All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit! ,[tries to open the door], Oh, yeah, the door's locked. ,[lifts up the welcome mat], Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr! ,[inserts key and walks in], Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster. ,[Patrick walks up],
,Patrick:, That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!
,SpongeBob:, It was?
,Patrick:, Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!
,SpongeBob:, I am?
,Patrick:, Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya! ,[walks out],
,SpongeBob:, ,[smiles], SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all. ,[Gary's got a lampshade on his head], Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Good night, Gary. ,[turns off the light and Patchy reappears],
,Patchy:, Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going! Ready for some real music, Potty?
,Potty:, ,[someone places corks in his ears], Bawk! Okay, ready.

,Patchy:, Thank you, Potty, I almost forgot... ,[Potty gives him the flute and he is about to play it, but Patchy stops], Hey wait a minute, I don't play a flute, I play a fife. ,[the flute is revealed to be a lit stick of dynamite painted to look like a flute], ,[screaming and his eye patch goes up], Potty, no! ,[the dynamite explodes and everybody cheers], Wow, I can't believe I survived that one. ,[realizes his body is destroyed and he is reduced to only a head; he whimpers], Potty, help me!
,Potty:, Ladies and Gentlemen, bawk! The Bird Brains!
,Bird Brains:, ♪Come with me to the land I love, It's not right here, down the street, or up above. It's down below in the deep blue sea. Where SpongeBob lives, and the fun is always free.

"[A sign that says ""Fine Antiques For Sale"" is put in Mr. Krabs' front yard. Mr. Krabs assembles a rug for the ""antiques"" to be put in.],
,French Narrator:, Ah, a yard sale. You know the old saying: ""One man's trash is another man's treasure.""
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[digs in the trash and pulls out a broken razor], Disposable? Phooey. ,[grabs the trash can and puts all the items in it on his rug for his yard sale],
,Narrator:, For Mr. Krabs, all trash is treasure. ,[Mr. Krabs gets another trash can and dumps it on the rug. He sniffs the odor, then uses fresh scent odor spray and sprays it on the pile of trash],
,Mr. Krabs:, Open for business. ,[fish walks up], See anything you like?
,Fish #1:, Yeah, I'll give you a buck-50 for this umbrella. ,[umbrella has holes in it],
,Mr. Krabs:, A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.
,Fish #1:, Ten bucks? ,[opens up the umbrella], It's full of holes.
,Mr. Krabs:, It was the queen of Switzerland.
,Fish #1:, A queen you say? That's-- Wait a second... they don't have a queen!
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.
,Fish #1:, ,[hands money to Mr. Krabs], Deal! ,[walks off],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[smells the money], Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker. ,[slurping in background],
,SpongeBob:, They taste even better. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are licking lollipops], Hi, Mr. Krabs.
,Patrick:, Whatcha you doing?
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs a plunger], Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?
,Patrick:, That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs the plunger from SpongeBob], That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh... ,[turns the rubber part of the plunger upside-down], ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?
,Patrick:, Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?
,Mr. Krabs:, Five bucks.
,Patrick:, ,[gets out his money], I only got seven.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs the money], Deal.
,Patrick:, Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper. ,[grabs his lollipop, now stuck on a pair of underwear, and licks it],
,SpongeBob:, Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Mr. Krabs:, This hat says, ""Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking."" This hat was made for you, boy. ,[puts it on SpongeBob], You were born to wear this hat.
,SpongeBob:, Ee-hee, ooh...!
,Mr. Krabs:, A perfect fit, eh, son?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together! ,[sighs. His eyes fill up with joyful tears], How can I ever repay you?
,Mr. Krabs:, With 10 dollars.
,SpongeBob:, ,[reaches into his pocket and takes out some money], All I have is 5.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, I guess it's no deal.
,SpongeBob:, I'll be right back. ,[zips home to get change out of the couch, in his shoe, and in his piggy bank then runs back to Mr. Krabs], Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?
,Mr. Krabs:, Well-- I don't know... uh, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, Mr. Krabs. ,[he and Patrick walk off],
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't mention it, boys. ,[chuckles], What a couple of rubes.
,Fish #2:, Excuse me, sir, but are you the purveyor of this curio stand?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, I am.
,Fish #2:, I understand you're selling this rare novelty drink hat. ,[holds up a picture of the hat that SpongeBob just bought],
,Mr. Krabs:, Fresh out.
,Fish #2:, Let me explain. ,[takes out some money], I'm prepared to give you $500 for that drink hat.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[drools], Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...
,Fish #3:, Not so fast. ,[elbows the other fish out of the way], I'll give you $1000 for such a hat. ,[Mr. Krabs is stammering and drooling],
,Nat:, I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat. ,[Mr. Krabs is drooling up a river],
,Fred:, ,[in a row boat], Sir? I'll give you one million dollars for that hat! ,[row boat drifts off],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs off to find the hat, leaving a trail of drool behind], SpongeBob! ,[Cut to SpongeBob blowing bubbles with his new hat, in front of his house. Mr. Krabs is hiding behind a rock], There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.
,SpongeBob:, Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.
,SpongeBob:, Am I a pretty girl?
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful. ,[mail fish looks at Mr. Krabs with his eyebrow raising], Uh... heh-heh. ,[SpongeBob laughs], All right, now give me the hat back.
,SpongeBob:, But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through. ,[Thought bubble of earlier. SpongeBob gets the hat and sits down a few feet away from the curio stand], Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up.
,Mr. Krabs:, Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.
,SpongeBob:, I'm not? ,[Cut to later where SpongeBob is still blowing bubbles when Mr. Krabs shows up with a bag of hats],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?
,SpongeBob:, Yep.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?
,SpongeBob:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?
,SpongeBob:, Uh-uh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Not even a teensy-tiny bit?
,SpongeBob:, Nope.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.
,SpongeBob:, What is it?
,Mr. Krabs:, Novelty hats. ,[takes out a hat with a fan on top of it], How about this air-condition one? ,[turns it on and blows air really hard in SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, Seems a little dangerous. ,[Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with a mixer on it],
,Mr. Krabs:, The juicer. ,[puts in a carrot and the juicer spits out carrot juice],
,SpongeBob:, Ooh... ,[Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with the words 'FOXY GRANDPA' on it],
,Mr. Krabs:, Foxy Grandpa? ,[SpongeBob laughs], So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?
,SpongeBob:, No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though.
,Mr. Krabs:, I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this, but he leaves me no other option. [close-up on his mouth] I'm gonna have to scare it off of him. ,[Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob is snoring and Mr. Krabs is outside his window, drawing a ghost, then hanging it off a fishing pole], Heh-heh-heh! This'll scare him. ,[puts it inside SpongeBob's window and adds scary moaning for sound effects],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list! ,[Piece of paper is on the wrong side. SpongeBob screams],
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm not a shopping list... ,[turns paper around to show ghost], I'm a ghost!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs evilly], Now, listen, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, How do you know my name?! Who are you?!
,Mr. Krabs:, I am the ghost of soda drink hats. ,[hangs down another piece of paper with the soda drinking hat that SpongeBob has], I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed.
,SpongeBob:, Cursed?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes. It must belonged to some guy who's dead now.
,SpongeBob:, What guy?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh... Smitty something.
,SpongeBob:, Smitty what?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.
,SpongeBob:, He must've been number one.
,Mr. Krabs:, Number one in Bogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.
,SpongeBob:, Immediately?
,Mr. Krabs:, Immediately...
,SpongeBob:, To its owner?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes...
,SpongeBob:, Right now?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up behind Mr. Krabs, covered in dirt and holding a shovel], Hey, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?
,SpongeBob:, I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[grabs SpongeBob], What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!
,SpongeBob:, Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.
,Mr. Krabs:, How did? I just... You did... I did... Gimme that shovel. ,[walks off to the cemetery],
,SpongeBob:, It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1! ,[Cut to Floater's Cemetery where eerie moaning is heard. A clam on a tree branch hoots like an owl],
,Mr. Krabs:, Huh? ,[Ducks as a bunch of clams are flying over him. Then a black snail growls at him], Ahh! ,[The black snail slithers away], Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones. ,[gate squeaks open], Ah! ,[hides behind a tombstone on a hill], What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here? ,[Sees Squidward crying as he walks up to a tombstone, puts flowers on it, then leaves. Mr. Krabs walks up to the tombstone Squidward was looking at and reads it], ""Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams."" What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster. ,[looks at the names on the different tombstones], Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh... No. Not there. ,[Cut to later], I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue. ,[thought bubble of SpongeBob appears],
,SpongeBob:, Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets. ,[thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears],
,Mr. Krabs:, No, not that! ,[second thought bubble of SpongeBob appears],
,SpongeBob:, You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess! ,[second thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[repeatedly], No, no, no! ,[third thought bubble of SpongeBob appears],
,SpongeBob:, It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[punches thought bubble away], Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find-- ,[he sees the tombstone and it shows his real name, Smitty Werben Man Jensen], The grave! Am I ,really, going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am! ,[digs and hits something], Jackpot! ,[opens up the coffin], Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa. ,[takes head off with the hat on], Hey, come on, Smitty, let go! ,[takes his head off], Rest in pieces, Smitty. ,[jumps out of the hole], I got the million dollar hat. ,[lightning and thunder booms. Smitty stands up from his grave with his head in one hand],
,Smitty:, Hey, man, that's my hat. Give it back.
,Mr. Krabs:, What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.
,Smitty:, I guess I'm gonna have to take it from you.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, right. You and what army?
,Smitty:, ,[eerie moaning], Only the army of the living dead. ,[all the other dead bodies are walking towards Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.
,Smitty:, That's disgusting. We just want the hat back.
,Mr. Krabs:, No flipping way! ,[takes the head of a swordfish and uses it as a sword], Back off! Back off, I say.
,Smitty:, Attack. ,[the zombies ready their weapons],
,Mr. Krabs:, Tallyho! ,[sword fights a few zombies], Look at me, I'm Errol Fin! ,[chops up more bodies], You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding. ,[sword fights them], Back to oblivion. ,[jumps over a group of zombies], Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over. Yee-hoo, ha-ha! ,[twirls around and destroys more of the zombies in the morning Mr. Krabs finishes destroying all the skeleton zombies and runs out of the cemetery], Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars! ,[runs back to his curio stand where the fish are talking altogether at once], Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars. ,[all of the fish laugh],
,Fred:, Yeah, you want that all at once?
,Fish #3:, One million dollars. You gotta be kidding!
,Nat:, Hey! The poor sap's not kidding. Didn't you hear? They found a whole warehouse full of them. They're worthless. ,[Bunch of soda drinking hats are in the dumpster. The fish crack up laughing. SpongeBob walks by with a hat with clapping hands on the top of it],
,SpongeBob:, Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand. ,[laughs],
,Nat:, Now that's worth a million dollars. ,[SpongeBob laughs again and he leaves the background. Nat runs after him and the other fish follow], Hey, kid, wait up!
,Fish #2:, I saw him first!
,Fish #3:, I'll give you one billion dollars!
,[Fred rows his row-boat along the ground to chase SpongeBob],
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, that's a spirit breaker. ,[throws the soda drinking hat away and breaks down sobbing],
,Squidward:, ,[walks by with flowers in hand], What a baby. [walks off]

"[SpongeBob is asleep. When his ringing shell phone wakes him up, he gives a startled yelp and then answers],
,SpongeBob:, Hello?
,Sandy:, Hey, SpongeBob. How's it going?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hiya, Sandy!
,Sandy:, Hey, listen, I was wondering if you could come by tonight.
,SpongeBob:, Sure! What's up?
,Sandy:, I whipped up an invention I'm gonna unveil tonight in front of my comrades, and I need you to be my test subject!
,SpongeBob:, I will be there!
,Sandy:, You're not gonna forget, are ya?
,SpongeBob:, Of course not! Have I ever let you down before? ,[silence], Hello?
,Sandy:, Just be here!
,SpongeBob:, With Gary as my witness, I won't let you down, Miss Cheeks! ,[cut to him walking to the Krusty Krab, chanting], I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! ,[inside, Mr. Krabs is sitting at a table trying to assemble a ""Build-Your-Own-Telescope"" kit],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, how the barnacles do you put this thing together? ,[SpongeBob passes Mr. Krabs and walks into the kitchen],
,SpongeBob:, I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! Good morning, cap'n! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down, down! I won't let Sandy down! Right after work I'm going over to Sandy's, who I'm not gonna let down.
,Mr. Krabs:, Boy?
,SpongeBob:, Yes, sir?
,Mr. Krabs:, I've got a special assignment for you. This is a build-it-yourself telescope. The only problem is, I can't figure out how to put the darn thing together. That's where you come in. ,[pushes a book at him],
,SpongeBob:, ""Telescope Assembly Manual""...
,Mr. Krabs:, Now read this cover-to-cover, and be prepared to put this together at me house tonight.
,SpongeBob:, Tonight?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's not gonna be a problem, is it?
,SpongeBob:, Umm... Well, actually...
,Mr. Krabs:, Excellent! Because I was looking at your annual employee report card...,[puts on reading glasses and looks at a sheet of paper, where such tasks as ""Keeps Work Area Clean"", ""Arrives at Work on Time"" and ""Keeps up on Hygiene"" are checked under ""Annual Employee Report for SpongeBob SquarePants"", the only one unmarked is ""Does a Laborious Task for Supervisor""], ...and it appears the ""Does Laborious Task for Supervisor"" box is unchecked. ,[SpongeBob gasps], See ya tonight!
,SpongeBob:, What am I gonna do? ,[Mr. Krabs leaves], You can do it. You made the commitments, you have to honor them. Both of them.
,Patrick:, ,[off-screen], Who're you talking to, buddy? ,[Patrick appears and SpongeBob accidentally flings a patty over his eyes, blindly bumping into Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, hiya, Patrick. What're you doing back here? ,[Puts the patty in his pants],
,Patrick:, Sorry to disturb you during work hours. I just wanted to remind you about my birthday.
,SpongeBob:, No need to remind me! I wouldn't forget about my best buddy's birthday!
,Patrick:, Then why aren't you saying the words?
,SpongeBob:, What words?
,Patrick:, ""Happy birthday""! It's today! My birthday's today! ,[SpongeBob deflates], Well, you surely must remember what you're gonna bring to my birthday, right?
,SpongeBob:, Uhh...
,Patrick:, My birthday cake! You're supposed to bring my birthday cake!
,SpongeBob:, Tonight?
,Patrick:, Yes, tonight! Well, when else am I gonna celebrate it? At least I had the courtesy to start the party after my best friend got off of work. See ya tonight, buddy!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Neptune! This is worse than I ever could've imagined! ,[cut to 6 pm, SpongeBob removes his Krusty Krab hat], Right! Time to be all I can be! ,[he runs to Sandy's treedome house in a tux and his usual water helmet, tons of fish are there, and Sandy is up on a stage, in a purple dress, putting the final touches on her invention, which is still mostly covered by a veil except the part she is working on], Man, these people sure look science-y. Sandy must be pulling out all the stops for this one. ,[SpongeBob walks up to Sandy], Hey, Sandy! What'cha doing?
,Sandy:, Hey, SpongeBob! Just putting the finishing touches on my invention. Thanks for assisting me! You're such a big help! No wonder Mr. Krabs relies on you so heavily. ,[SpongeBob gasps],
,SpongeBob:, ,[quietly], I gotta help Mr. Krabs! Uh, Sandy, I gotta run to the, uh, gents' room. ,[he leaves the treedome, and stuff his tux into the front of his pants, and the sleeves into the sides], Now, if I finish up with Mr. Krabs, that'll clear me up to assist Sandy! ,[runs over to Mr. Krabs' anchor house. Krabs sits on the living room floor with the kit],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob! I knew I wouldn't have to fire ya!
,SpongeBob:, You can rely on me, sir! I wouldn't wanna jeopardize my employee record. ,[laughs], Okay, let's see what we got here. Oh, it says on page 472, section C-17, that you need a right-angled motorized hex drill to assemble this thing.
,Mr. Krabs:, Really... Why don't you go into town and pick up one of those hex drill thingies.
,SpongeBob:, I...
,Mr. Krabs:, Or you could sit there and watch me fill out your employee report card...
,[Mr. Krabs clicks his pen, and SpongeBob runs out into downtown Bikini Bottom, he slams into the door of Tom's Toolery, there is a note on the door],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reading], ""Dear valued Tom's Toolery customers, we are closed this week in observance of Porpoise Day. Please call again."" Barnacles! Where can I find a motorized hex drill now? ,[has flashback to Sandy holding one while finishing her invention],
,Sandy:, ,[in thought cloud], Just finishin' up here!
,SpongeBob:, Sandy! ,[he is about to run to Sandy's, when he slams into Patrick], Heh, oh, hey, Patrick! What're you doing in town?
,Patrick:, I was just buying some birthday hats for my birthday party. ,[he pulls out a transparent bag with a red hat, a green hat and a purple hat inside, he wears a purple one, and puts the red one on SpongeBob], You didn't forget my party, did you?
,SpongeBob:, Forget? How can I forget my best friend's birthday party?
,Patrick:, You're already forgetting one thing!
,SpongeBob:, Ha, ha! No, I haven't!... Have I?
,Patrick:, Hello!?! My birthday cake!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah, that! I w... I was just getting to that! That's why I was here in town! Forget your birthday cake! You're hilarious, Star, you really are! Now, you just go home, and I'm gonna go get your cake, you silly guy, you! ,[he rounds the corner and darts off to the bakery, which is shaped like a muffin and run by a nasty old lady], Hi! I need a birthday cake!
,Cashier:, This is what I got... ,[hands him a yellow cake with lavender and baby blue icing that says ""Sorry About the Scabies""],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reading], ""Sorry About the Scabies"". Um, can you change it to say ""Happy Birthday""?
,Cashier:, Do you want it, or not? I haven't got all night!
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, here you are. ,[he pays her and runs out with it just as the store closes, and runs by the treedome on his way back, stopping in his tracks], Sandy's drill! ,[he wriggles out of his pants, his tuxedo underneath, while still holding up his cake and kicks them into his back pocket, inside the treedome, everyone is sitting in front of the stage, chatting impatiently, waiting for SpongeBob, he slips behind the stage and shifts through Sandy's toolbox],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[startled], Oh, hi! I was just, uh, making sure you had your hardware!
,Sandy:, Well, that's an unusual getup. ,[she looks at his birthday hat, which he forgot to take off],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I just thought I'd be a little festive, you know, for the scientists...
,Sandy:, And the birthday cake? ,[SpongeBob shrugs and chuckles, but Sandy doesn't have time, she drags him onstage under a banner that says ""Night of Discovery"" and goes up to the podium to speak into a microphone], Greetings, my distinguished colleagues! Tonight, you will witness an invention so revolutionary, it may change modern science forever! Now to demonstrate, my assistant will disrobe and enter the machine.
,SpongeBob:, What? ,[she hands him a gown],
,Sandy:, Some of you may be wondering why the test subject is disrobing. It is because... ,[she looks at SpongeBob with a horrified look], What's under your gown? ,[there is a bulge coming from the back of SpongeBob's outfit],
,SpongeBob:, It must be that spicy kelp I ate earlier. I gotta go use the lavatory. I'll be right back! ,[he runs out and goes to Patrick's rock, he knocks and it opens], Happy birthday! ,[he walks inside, and it slams shut on his arm],
,Patrick:, You finally made it! ,[slides his arm out],
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, there was a, uhh... Big... Traffic... Storm.
,Patrick:, Well, just leave my present over on the present table! ,[he points to a sand table with a banner over it that says ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY ME"", the ""P""s, ""R""s, ""D""s and ""E""s are backwards, SpongeBob's eyes burn out in desperation],
,SpongeBob:, Your present?
,Patrick:, I'm so excited, I've been waiting for a whole year!
,SpongeBob:, I've got it, it's right here! ,[he tears off a piece of his lab robe and wraps Sandy's drill with it], Ta-da! See, all wrapped up and ready to go! ,[he places it on the table],
,Patrick:, Well, what're you waiting for, buddy? Serve up the cake so I can tear into that present!
,SpongeBob:, The cake! I must've left it at Sandy's!
,Patrick:, You took it to Sandy's?
,SpongeBob:, No! I said ""The bakery delivers, isn't that handy?"". In fact, I think I hear them right now outside! Wait there while I go check. ,[he sneaks back into Sandy's treedome and grabs that cake],
,Sandy:, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, barnacles. ,[goes back onstage with the cake],
,Sandy:, I apologize for the delay. Now let's continue the demonstration. I give you, the Protogenerator 2000! ,[she uncovers a large machine with a pump, chamber and vacuum tube, everyone applauds], This device gives a single laborer the productivity of 5, 6, 7, up to 8 workers... ,[the door closes after SpongeBob steps inside the machine, he pulls a string, and the gown falls off of him leaving him naked all night], ...which is great for the management, but is also a boom for the workers because they'll always get high marks on their employee report card! ,[SpongeBob remembers Mr. Krabs talking to him],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[in thought cloud], I was just looking at your employee report card...
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasps], The telescope!
,Sandy:, Without further delay, I will now initiate the protosequence. ,[SpongeBob pops out of the machine],
,SpongeBob:, Uh, Sandy, I hate to delay the proceedings, but, uh, I forgot to mail in this mail-in rebate and, uh... I'll be right back. ,[everyone looks on angrily as SpongeBob runs to Mr. Krabs' house naked], Okay, let's get started, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, What happened to your clothes, boy?
,SpongeBob:, ,[trying to ignore the subject], Sardines! Yeah, I was attacked by a can of wild sardines. Now let's finish this telescope. ,[he struggles to put together two pieces in a frenzy],
,Mr. Krabs:, Boy? Hold on, boy, you're supposed to be using that motorized hex drill! Now, where is it?
,SpongeBob:, Ugh! I left it at Patrick's rock!
,Mr. Krabs:, Patrick's rock? Whatcha do with it there? ,[SpongeBob runs out, Mr. Krabs hot on his trail], SpongeBob, wait! Get back here, boy! ,[SpongeBob hops into Patrick's rock],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, why are your clothes invisible?
,SpongeBob:, ,[trying to stay undressed and ignore the subject], Never mind that, could I please borrow your present?
,Patrick:, No, no, you can't borrow my birthday present!
,SpongeBob:, Not even for a minute?
,Patrick:, No, not till you deliver my birthday cake.
,SpongeBob:, Okay, I'll be right back! ,[SpongeBob darts off again],
,Patrick:, Hold on, where're you going? ,[Mr. Krabs catches up, and he and Patrick follow SpongeBob to the treedome. Out of breath, SpongeBob pants up to the stage, grabs the cake and is about to leave when Sandy stops him],
,Sandy:, Hold it! Where is my little assistant going this time? ,[Mr. Krabs and Patrick come in, wearing water helmets],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,Your, little assistant? That's ,my, assistant you're talking to! What's going on here!?!
,Patrick:, Yeah, I'd like to know also! What kind of a birthday present is this? ,[unwraps the hex drill],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, SpongeBob was supposed to bring that to me!
,Sandy:, That looks like my power drill! ,[to SpongeBob], You've got a lot of explaining to do, mister! ,[everyone is shouting],
,SpongeBob:, ,[drowned out], I've got something to say. I've got something to say. I've got so... I have got something to say! ,[SpongeBob looked furious after screaming; they all shut up, even the crowd; SpongeBob pants], I know you all had important things tonight. Mr. Krabs, your telescope, Patrick, your birthday, and, Sandy, you have this big presentation. I just couldn't say ""no"" to any of you.
,Sandy:, Aw, you overextended yourself.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, you should've said something.
,Patrick:, We could've worked something out.
,SpongeBob:, Aw. You know, you guys are right. It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once.
,Sandy:, Nonsense, SpongeBob! Of course you can, if you'll just step into the Protogenerator 2000! ,[he does so], First, I close the protochamber... ,[she shuts the door and turns a dial], ...And finally... ,she presses a button, and there is a glowing light from the chamber, everyone gasps as two SpongeBobs emerge from the tube],
,SpongeBob #2:, D'oh!
,SpongeBob #3:, D'oh!
,Sandy:, As you can see, I've made two clones of my subject which will allow him to honor all of the commitments he's made this evening. ,[everyone applauds], You hear that, SpongeBob? You can be in three places at once now! ,[the glass door slides back open to reveal SpongeBob asleep and the episode ends],

"[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab where Squidward is selling his paintings.],
,Squidward:, Ladies and gentlemen, behold my wondrous paintings!
,[The customers ignore him and continue eating their foods. Squidward moans and gets really angry.],
,Tom:, Um, excuse me, can I have some ketchup?
,Squidward:, Hey, look at my arts you dummy!
,[Tom falls over, splattering patties all over SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[wipes the patties off his face], I don't know how you talked me into this art show, SpongeBob, but I'm shutting this thing down right now! ,[wipes the patties off SpongeBob's face],
,SpongeBob:, Aw, you can't, Mr. Krabs. Wait until Squidward sells some of his paintings.
,Squidward:, Buy some important paintings. See me expose my exquisite suffering.
,[The customers continue to ignore Squidward and continue eating their foods.],
,Squidward:, Hmph! These fools don't even recognize the masterworks in front of their faces. I'll confront them with the power of my art!
,[Squidward runs up to a customer with a painting of himself with a shirt on.],
,Squidward:, Witness the beauty!
,[The customer spits his food onto the painting.],
,Larry:, Come on, Larry! Get your salad on!
,Squidward:, Come on, Larry! Get your art on! ,[holds up a painting of his muscular self with a sea bear],
,Larry:, ,[his eyes flare up], Oh! My eyes! Ahh! ,[pulls his burning eyes out and his innards flare up as well], The pain! ,[runs away],
,[Squidward backs away slowly.],
,Orchid's son:, I want a Krabby Meal!
,Squidward:, ,[baby talk], How about some art to go with that? ,[holds up a painting of two Squidwards riding each other on the beach],
,Orchid's son:, Ahh!
,Orchid:, ,[screams], Run, baby, run!
,[Orchid and her son run out of the restaurant.],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's it! Squidward is scaring me customers away! I'm shuttin' this art show down! He's never gonna sell his paintings!
,SpongeBob:, Sure he will! ,[holds up a painting], I just bought one.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Holy shrimp! Why would you do that to yourself?
,SpongeBob:, What do you mean? I love it.
,[SpongeBob holds the painting in front of a customer, but the customer's head burns up and his body crawls to the floor.],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, Squidward is our friend and his paintings are so cheap, you should buy one just to be nice.
,Customer:, ,[coughs], I'm good.
,Mr. Krabs:, Nice? Nice? I don't waste my money on nice!
,SpongeBob:, But think about how valuable these paintings might become.
,Mr. Krabs:, Valuable? What do you mean?
,SpongeBob:, When art gets older, ,[his face becomes old], it usually gets more expensive. ,[his face becomes money], Squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday.
,Mr. Krabs:, Millions?! ,[his tongue makes a dollar sign and he pushes SpongeBob], Out of me way! Here! ,[throws coins at Squidward and takes the paintings], Gimme! ,[grabs the painting he missed], Give it here! This is mine now!
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Mr. Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Now, all I need to do is sit back and watch me art grow more valuable. ,[his eyes turn into coins as he laughs],
,Art Appraiser:, I am a very important art appraiser and I say this so-called art will never be worth a penny.
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, Eugene H. Krabs does not—,[freaks out and gasps], I'll lose money! There must be something I can do to make this art worth lots more cash!
,Art Appraiser:, ,[lowers his glasses], Hmm...
,Squidward:, I sold all my art? This tiny handful of coins has legitimized me! ,[puts on his beret], Who wants the autograph of a real artiste?
,[Squidward paints his signature on a tough guy's forehead, which angers him. The tough guy throws Squidward out the door.],
,Art Appraiser:, Well, paintings can become much more valuable when the artist is no longer with us. You know. Out of the picture. ,[pretends to hang himself],
,Mr. Krabs:, Out of the picture, eh? I think I can arrange this.
,[Squidward walks back in the restaurant.],
,Squidward:, Artist walking. Check me out.
,Mr. Krabs:, Check this out. ,[holds out a delivery bag], I have a delivery for ya, Mr. Squidward.
,Squidward:, What? You can't be serious. An artist such as myself should not be subject to such menial tasks.
,SpongeBob:, Aw, don't be menial to Squidward, Mr. Krabs. I'll take the delivery.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, Mr. Squidward is a real artist now and real artists can handle anything.
,[The scene changes to Squidward walking through the arctic tundra with the delivery bag.],
,Squidward:, The arctic is so cold! ,[shivers and the wind blows upon Squidward], Come on, Squidward. You're a strong artist. You can do it! ,[the wind blows him off], No!
,[Squidward is blown off the cliff and falls into the snow next to a snowman who looks like SpongeBob.],
,Squidward:, ,[shivers and looks at the snowman], SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[sneaks up behind Squidward], Oh, hi, Squidward!
,Squidward:, ,[screams], SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
,SpongeBob:, Just getting some ice. ,[holds up a large cube of ice], Fresh. ,[stuffs the ice inside his mouth and laughs], Need some help? ,[falls in Squidward's hole], Whoa!
,[SpongeBob lifts Squidward out of the hole as the SpongeBob-snowman comes to life. SpongeBob and Squidward walk over to an arctic sperm whale.],
,Squidward:, Here's your food.
,[The arctic sperm whale takes the delivery bag and pulls out a Krabby Patty frozen in ice. Then he takes a bite of the frozen patty.],
,Arctic Sperm Whale:, Hey, this is cold! Perfect!
,[SpongeBob and the arctic sperm whale laugh. The whale slaps Squidward and he breaks into pieces.],
,SpongeBob:, Eeh, we'd better get you home.
,[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs on the phone in his office.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hello, is this the art appraiser? Just wanted to let you know that me good, good friend, Squidward, is now ""out of the pict—"" ,[sees SpongeBob and Squidward walk in], Wh—wh—wh—What the seahorse?! ,[runs up with another delivery bag], Got another delivery for you, Squidward! ,[points to SpongeBob], And only Squidward!
,SpongeBob:, Your eyes are so pretty.
,[Mr. Krabs giggles. The scene changes to Squidward going to Rock Bottom on a bus.],
,Bus Driver:, Next ,[raspberry], stop, ,[raspberry], Rock ,[raspberry], Bottom! ,[raspberry],
,[Squidward exits the bus and two very creepy fish swim past him.],
,Squidward:, ,[reads bag], ""237 Rock Bottom."" Oh, there it is! Oh, remember, Squidward, real artists embrace the unknown. ,[goes down the ladder], Uh, is anyone here? ,[raspberry], I've got a delivery from the Krusty ,[raspberry], Krab!
,[Creepy fish come up and blow raspberries at Squidward.],
,Squidward:, Ahh!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams as he appears next to Squidward], What are we screaming about?
,Squidward:, Monsters!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, they're not monsters, Squidward. They're my friends.
,Angler Fish:, What's ,[raspberry], up, ,[raspberry], SpongeBob? Ha. ,[raspberry],
,[The angler fish and gang put on party hats and dance as they blow raspberries. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs erasing Squidward's picture on the paper.],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[on the phone], Yes, I'm sure that Mr. Squidward is out of the picture for good. He will be missed. So, come on over and tell old Krabs how much money me paintings are worth. ,[hangs up the phone and laughs],
,[SpongeBob and Squidward appear with party hats, laughing.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha, ha, ha, he-he, ha. ,[sobbing and growls], Squidward, delivery! ,[gives him another delivery bag],
,[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and ties him to a chair.],
,SpongeBob:, Ha, this tickles. ,[giggles],
,Mr. Krabs:, Follow me, Mr. Squidward. I've got a special delivery vehicle just for a great artist like yourself.
,Squidward:, Well, that's more like it. Finally, some respect.
,Mr. Krabs:, Into the rocket ya go!
,[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward into the rocket ship and Squidward gets strapped into the seat.],
,Squidward:, Wait! Why do I need a rocket? Where is this delivery to?
,Mr. Krabs:, Mars. ,[closes door],
,Squidward:, Oh, Mars. Well, the...M—M—M—M—M—Mars?!
,SpongeBob:, Bye, Squidward!
,[Mr. Krabs launches the rocket and it blasts off into space. The rocket flies Squidward all the way to the planet, Mars. Squidward walks towards three martians-like creatures and hands them the delivery bag.],
,Squidward:, Delivery from the Krusty Krab.
,[The martian takes the bag and pulls out the Krabby Patty. Then the martian eats the patty.],
,Martian:, Mmm! Yummy, yummy! ,[gibberish],
,[The martians hover together and eat the delivery Squidward gave them.],
,Squidward:, Hmph. All this red. So garish. Ha, this dump needs a true artist touch.
,Martians:, Huh?
,[The martian roars and swallows Squidward whole. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab back on Earth.],
,Mr. Krabs:, So, now that Squidward definitely 100% is gone for good, what a shame, what do you think of these here paintings?
,Art Appraiser:, Well, of course they're awful, but if the so-called artist is really out of the picture, then perhaps they're worth something.
,Mr. Krabs:, Really? ,[sobs], Oh, it's so complicated. These are tears of joy, but they're also tears of sadness for my good friend, Squidward. Wherever he is.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, here he is, Mr. Krabs!
,[Squidward appears in a UFO outside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rushes outside.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Stay here and keep an eye on me investments. ,[runs outside],
,[The UFO drops Squidward off and flies away, leaving him covered in slime. Squidward is paralyzed at the events on Mars, but recovers quickly.],
,Squidward:, ,[wipes the slime off and puts his beret back on], Well, that was disgusting. So, who wants to talk about my use of color and brush stroke?
,[Mr. Krabs growls.],
,Art Appraiser:, Ahem! ,[rips the $150,000 tag], Hmph!
,Mr. Krabs:, I have done everything I could to get you away from here safely and now you're messing with me money!
,[Mr. Krabs pulls out a mallet and Squidward runs away, screaming.],
,SpongeBob:, Run, Squidward, run!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! How about a little support here?
,SpongeBob:, Run, Mr. Krabs, run!
,[Mr. Krabs runs off after Squidward, screaming.],
,SpongeBob:, But a little slower than Squidward.
,French Narrator:, 3 hours later...
,[Squidward is still being chased around by Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is using a human nose mask to track down Squidward. SpongeBob appears hiding behind some rocks, grabs Squidward and covers his mouth.],
,SpongeBob:, Psst, it's your best friend, SpongeBob.
,[Mr. Krabs continues to sniff around.],
,Squidward:, Oh, get off of me!
,SpongeBob:, I'll never get off of you, Squidward. Not until you're safe.
,Squidward:, I'll never be safe! ,[pushes SpongeBob off], Not until my paintings are gone!
,SpongeBob:, No, Squidward! You can't deprive the world of your paintings!
,Squidward:, True, but it's better than depriving the world of me!
,[Mr. Krabs finds Squidward and SpongeBob behind the rocks and goes to hit them with his mallet. Mr. Krabs chases Squidward and SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab in a fast pace.],
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Squidward! Destroy those paintings before Mr. Krabs gets back!
,[Squidward pulls out a power saw and hesitantly goes to destroy the paintings. However, he doesn't have the guts to do it.],
,Squidward:, I...I can't do it! They're just too magnificent!
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, hey, hey! Get away from me paintings!
,Squidward:, Oh, I'm sorry, paintings, but it's you or me!
,[Squidward destroys several paintings with his power saw.],
,Art Appraiser:, Yes, yes! Now, this is true art!
,Squidward:, What? Really?
,Art Appraiser:, So visceral! So dangerous!
,Squidward:, Yes, feel my art! ,[destroys some paintings with his power saw],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[crashes through the doors], Leave me paintings alone, you monster!
,Art Appraiser:, No! That was the most accelerating performance art I have ever seen!
,Mr. Krabs:, Really? So, it must be worth millions! Hey, out of me way!
,[Mr. Krabs proceeds in helping Squidward destroy all of the paintings. Then they go to destroy the office and some tables.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles nervously], Mr. Krabs, uh, Squidward, I—I don't think you should be doing that.
,Squidward:, Oh, don't be so provincial, SpongeBob!
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, stop trying to censor our money! I mean our art!
,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward continue to destroy everything in the Krusty Krab. They destroy the menu, the clock, and the cashier boat. They even destroy the table of a paid customer, who was about to eat his lunch.],
,Art Appraiser:, ,[gasps], Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
,[Mr. Krabs and Squidward continue to destroy the Krusty Krab until it is nothing but shambles. They exhaustedly walk up to SpongeBob and the art appraiser.],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoo, boy! Hee, hee! So, how much ya gonna give me for all this? Ha, ha.
,Art Appraiser:, Nothing! Performance art is about the moment. You cannot put a price on it. ,[walks off],
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Wait, come back here, you double-crossin'—
,[A piece of the roof falls on top of Squidward and Mr. Krabs, crushing them.],
,SpongeBob:, D'oh! Mr. Krabs! Squidward!
,[SpongeBob lifts the roof piece up.],
,Art Appraiser:, Ah-ha!
,[The scene changes to the art appraiser giving a tour around the art museum.],
,Art Appraiser:, And that is how I acquired this masterpiece.
,[The masterpiece turns out to be a completely flattened Mr. Krabs and Squidward who are stuck on the fallen roof piece. The tourists chatter in wonder.],
,Squidward:, I'm an artist.
,Mr. Krabs:, I'm rich.
,SpongeBob:, And I helped. ,[laughs],

"[episode opens to the Krusty Krab and we see Squidward reading a magazine that says Everybody Ablomp Now. He then looks from the magazine and see a bunch of fish on the tables staring at him. Squidward twitches his eyebrows in a suspicious way. One of the customers slowly closes his eyes and opened it back. Squidward jumps by this and another customer falls over and licks the floor. Everyone appears like they're about to have seizures],
,Squidward:, ,[whispers with clenched teeth], SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? ,[Cut to the scene where we see two fishes with forks and knives and they're moaning like zombies. Squidward is stunned by this. Scene cuts to the kitchen. He pokes his head through the window],. SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low. ,[looks down on the grill to see some cards on it], Why are you grilling index cards? ,[close up to the index cards that talks about boating school],
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted. ,[holding up an index card], I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow.
,Squidward:, You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. Now get those orders ready!
,SpongeBob:, Okay! Okay! ,[takes off his hat and shoves out seven patties from inside it], Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday.
,[Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a Krabby Patty and gets shocked. We see a bunch of fish looking like zombies],
,SpongeBob:, No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them... ,[Cut to the scene where we see the customers moaning and the background changes to swirls], ...front of them looking... ,[SpongeBob backs away slowly to the kitchen], ...at me ,[closes the kitchen door. He peaks through the window and sees the customers], ...with their eyes! ,[He shrieks and ducks], Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!
,Squidward:, ,[grabs the Krabby Patty from SpongeBob], Must I do everything myself? ,[looks to his left], Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn. ,[Squidward gets pulled back, all customers begin to physically fight for the Krabby Patty, results Squidward getting beaten up. SpongeBob stretches his legs up and peaks over at the window. He looks at the fight and ducks as a barrel crashes in his direction. SpongeBob pulls back steadily],
,SpongeBob:, I never knew an audience can get so physical. ,[Squidward screams and is thrown to the back and is continuously mauled by the zombified customers], This changes everything. ,[He slowly creeps away as Squidward still gets beaten up.. Scene bubbles over to Patrick's Rock and Patrick goes over to it and opens it. We see SpongeBob on the rock],
,Patrick:, Oh, sorry, wrong rock. ,[Patrick turns to leave but SpongeBob stretches his arms to grab Patrick and takes him under the rock.. Scene cuts to the inside of Patrick's home where we see that SpongeBob made it look exactly like the inside of Mrs. Puff's Boating School],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[starts pulling at his eyes], Uhhh...
,SpongeBob:, No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here. ,[referring to the little platform he made out of sand], Just pretend you're a student at his desk.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[goes over to one of the desks made of sand and sits on it],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Gets on the little platform and holds up an index card],
,Patrick:, H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class. ,[He moves the sand desk a little farther, stops, then moves up a little],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, here goes. ,[reads], Boating safety is...
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?
,SpongeBob:, Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice.
,Patrick:, Fine.
,SpongeBob:, ,[clears throat], Boating safe...
,Patrick:, Boring! Next!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?
,Patrick:, All right, all right. ,[looks closely toward SpongeBob. Cut to a close-up of Patrick's face and he blinks his eyes],
,SpongeBob:, So, without further ado... ,[He sees that Patrick has fallen asleep], Patrick? ,[taps Patrick's forehead], Patrick, wake up. ,[Patrick slowly wakes up], What happened, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?
,Patrick:, Yes! And you should be prepared for worse.
,SpongeBob:, Worse?
,Patrick:, You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[stands on the small platform], Boating safety... ,[A pillow is thrown at his face], Boating safe... ,[More pillows are thrown at SpongeBob and we see that Patrick is the one that's throwing the pillows-fed up with his oral speaking, wants him to either stop or present more better and interesting],
,Patrick:, That's it! ,[grunts], Fight through! ,[SpongeBob is buried in a pile of pillows, but he rises up from the pile panting],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!
,Patrick:, Says you! Speech!
,SpongeBob:, Boating safe...
,[Patrick walks up to him dressed up like Mrs. Puff],
,Patrick:, ,[imitating Mrs. Puff], SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom.
,SpongeBob:, Uh, you sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick.
,Patrick:, ,[imitating Mrs. Puff], Young man, how dare you?! ,[He writes into a small notebook, tears a paper out, and hands it to SpongeBob, which is a detention slip],
,SpongeBob:, What, a detention slip?
,Patrick:, ,[imitating Mrs. Puff], I'm not hearing your oral report.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[reads], Boating safe... ,[A treadmill is place under him and he's running on it],
,Patrick:, Try again.
,SpongeBob:, ,[panting], Boating safety... ,[Patrick bangs on cymbals causing SpongeBob to lose his balance and hang on the handles],
,Patrick:, Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working. ,[As he is saying this his body starts to shred into a pile of yellow dust with his arms on top of it due to his body being on the treadmill],
,Patrick:, ,[shouts], Speech! ,[SpongeBob turns to normal and yells], Speech! Speech! Speech! ,[SpongeBob gets nervous], Speech! Speech! Speech! ,[SpongeBob shivers. Now Patrick's eyes are talking], Speech! Speech! Speech! ,[Now SpongeBob is more nervous], Speech! Speech! Spee -
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything. ,[shudders],
,Patrick:, Yeah, you do look pretty terrible.
,SpongeBob:, Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass. And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license! ,[starts crying],
,Patrick:, Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws. ,[holds up his hands that look exactly like a squirrel's], Maybe she can make you a fake one.
,SpongeBob:, No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!
,Patrick:, Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya. ,[SpongeBob looks surprised at what Patrick says. Scene bubbles over to Sandy who is examining SpongeBob with her magnifying glass],
,Sandy:, Hmm... White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. Y-y-yep. He does look pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted to severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow!
,SpongeBob:, ,[shudders],
,Sandy:, It has been scientifically proven that ,[pulls a paper down with a person on it], 85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear.
,[SpongeBob's hand take the clothes off the person and he covers his underwear. He tears the page to cover his underwear],
,Sandy:, Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous! Which is why I invented these. ,[shows an underwear with goggles stuck to it], Goggles that let you see people in your undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license.
,SpongeBob:, That's still illegal. Give me the goggles! ,[puts on the goggles but nothing's happening], It's not working.
,Sandy:, Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick.
,SpongeBob:, ,[turns to Patrick. He jumps at this], Eh! Ooh, they work.
,[Scene bubbles over to Mrs. Puff's Boating School],
,Billy:, ...and they were never heard from again.
,Mrs. Puff:, Thank you, Billy. That was an excellent report. Next we have-- ,[crosses off Billy, then sees SpongeBob], --SpongeBob SquarePants. Ugh.
,Patrick:, ,[zooms over to SpongeBob], Go on, buddy.
,SpongeBob:, ,[gives Patrick a thumbs up. He gets out of his seat and goes to the front of the room. He clears his throat and then freezes. Cut to the other side of the class. Cut to SpongeBob. He gulps],
,Mrs. Puff:, Well, SpongeBob? Do you have your oral report ready?
,SpongeBob:, ,[in a small voice], Huh...?
,Mrs. Puff:, The assignment I gave you. The one where you talk in front of the class.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready! ,[starts sweating], I can do it. ,[Shubie checks her watch], Um... ,[Scene goes across the room. In another scene, the background is yellow. It also shows angry people and Patrick about to throw a pillow at him], Oh, no. Oh, no!
,Mrs. Puff:, What are you doing?!
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?
,Mrs. Puff:, No. Only if you want to pass this class!
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[walks to the front of the room], Uh, my report...is on... ,[his pinky starts to vibrate. He holds it], Heh! Must be last-minute jitters! ,[starts to vibrate too. He goes all around the front of the room and stops where he was before], Patrick, where are those goggles?
,Patrick:, Right here. Let me polish them up for ya. ,[rubs his arm on the lens and it breaks], Here ya go.
,SpongeBob:, Thanks! ,[puts them on],
,Billy:, Hurry up! ,[in his underwear. SpongeBob gasps. The other people are in their underwear, too], Ha, ha, it's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...
,Mrs. Puff:, What's all this laughing about? ,[is wearing a bra and underwear], Well, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], ""Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because -- ,[his broken lens start to function weird. Billy's underwear now has a scary face on it],
,Scary Face:, Well, don't just stand there! Get on with it!
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams as he sees the other underwear with scary faces on them], They're all staring! ,[throws the hat on the floor and runs out the door],
,Patrick:, Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait! ,[SpongeBob drives a boat], SpongeBob!
,Mrs. Puff:, You can't take my boat! SpongeBob!
,Patrick:, Wait, SpongeBob!
,Mrs. Puff:, Get back here with my boat!
,Police Officer:, I don't know, slow day at the office, huh?
,Police Officer #2:, You said it, partner! My baton's itching for the noggin of a lawbreaker.
,SpongeBob:, ,[screams as he runs a stop sign],
,Police Officer:, Okay, forget what I just said. ,[Police Officer #1 and #2 chase after him],
,Police Officer:, Sponge, pull over!
,SpongeBob:, I don't know how!
,Patrick:, SpongeBob!
,[SpongeBob breaks through three houses, smashes into the next one and goes flying and lands on his head],
,Police Officer:, All right, kid, what was that all about?
,Police Officer #2:, Don't you know anything about boating safety?
,SpongeBob:, ,[he looks surprised], Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do. ,[he gets back on his feet], Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--
,Police Officer #2:, Gee, kid. ,[wipes a tear from his eye], That was beautiful.
,Police Officer:, Yeah. I never even knew some of those things myself.
,Mrs. Puff:, Aha! Finally! The long arm of the laws caught up with you! I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
,Police Officer:, Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles, did you say you were his boating instructor?
,Mrs. Puff:,  ,[getting nervous], Yes. Why?
,Police Officer:, Under penal code 26-1 quote, ""The boating instructor is responsible--""
,SpongeBob:, --""for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care"".
,Police Officer:, Unquote. I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, ma'am. ,[handcuffs Mr. Puff and puts her in the police car],
,Mrs. Puff:, What?! Nooo!
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!
,Patrick:, Oh, that reminds me. ,[shows the hat], You forgot these. ,[puts them on], Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh! ,[the scary face appears],

,SpongeBob:, ,[sniffs], Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.
,Mr. Krabs:, Explosive!? ,[Scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where Plankton is flying on a glider laughing evilly],
,Plankton:, Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene! ,[activates bomb, which blows up roof],
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!
,Plankton:, You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!
,Mr. Krabs:, Ready ammunition! ,[SpongeBob takes off his hat and reveals a peas can. Krabs opens the can with his claw and pours all the peas into SpongeBob. He then uses SpongeBob as a gun], Fire! ,[SpongeBob shoots pass at Plankton. The peas shoot through Plankton's air glider. But Plankton blows a bubble over himself causing the peas to be deflected. The deflected peas hits the frying pans. One of the frying pans fall and hits SpongeBob. Plankton then fires a missile at them], Take cover! ,[Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and uses him as a shield, but the missile just fall straight to the ground], Oh, ha, ha, it didn't blow up! Another dud, Plankton.
,Plankton:, Another dud huh? ,[He pushed a button which causes the missile to transform into a robotic arm and it squeezes Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob],
,Mr Krabs:, Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!
,Plankton:, No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and off I go.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well you ain't getting it.
,Plankton:, Well I constrict you to reconsider. ,[presses button and arm squeezes harder],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, go jump off a plank.
,Plankton:, Oh well, I have other ways of getting it when I need. Where is the formula, Krabs? ,[tickles Mr. Krabs with feather],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ha ha ha ha!
,Plankton:, Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs? ,[He tickles Mr. Krabs' nose with the feather causing him to sneeze and blowing Plankton to the ground], OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
,SpongeBob:, I'll never talk.
,Plankton:, Well, we'll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
,SpongeBob:, OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!

,Mr. Krabs:, She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.

,Pearl:, I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.
,Mr. Krabs:, Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales? ,[chuckles evilly], Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my formular, now get us out of this trap.
,Pearl:, Mall money.
,Mr. Krabs:, Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. ,[gives dollar to Pearl],. Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
,Pearl:, Double my mall money!

,Plankton:, Krabs had a whale!
,Karen:, You mean his big, scary, teenage daughter?
,Plankton:, I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
,[Plankton's family is shown being eaten by a whale],
,Karen:, OK When you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.

,Karen:, Are you out of your mind?
,Plankton:, See for yourself!
,Karen:, ,[checks the lab], No whale in here.

,SpongeBob:, Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?
,Plankton:, Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.
,Plankton:, Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
,SpongeBob:, Okay!
,[Cut to the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[erases a picture of Plankton], Goodbye, Pipsqueak!
,SpongeBob:, Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.
,Mr. Krabs:, Really? He's a mess! ,[laughs],
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?
,Mr. Krabs:, May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
,SpongeBob:, No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.
,[scene cuts to Plankton],
,Plankton:, ,[angrily], Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Plankton.
,Plankton:, What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.
,Plankton:, What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry. Everyone has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... ,[whispers in Plankton's ear],
,Plankton:, Really?
,SpongeBob:, Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of.
,Plankton:, You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!? ,[angrily], Why that conniving bottom feeder!
,SpongeBob:, But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?
,Plankton:, No, of course not.
,SpongeBob:, Well, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!
,Plankton:, No, no. Thank you! ,[laughs evilly. Bubble transition],
,Mr. Krabs:, This is almost too fun! ,[puts on costume], Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
,Plankton:, Oh, is that so.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes. ,[breaths deeply], Boo!
,Plankton:, You don't scare me, Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean... ,[Pearl's voice], I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
,Plankton:, The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
,Mr. Krabs:, Secret fear? ,[regular voice], What are you talkin' about?
,Plankton:, See for yourself. ,[the robotic arm squeezes Mr. Krabs], Enjoy the show! ,[a mime is shown],
,Mr. Krabs:, No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
,Plankton:, Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!
,SpongeBob:, Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.
,Plankton:, Why not?
,SpongeBob:, Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding. ,[Plankton gasps. Whales are outside],
,Plankton:, ,[scared], Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! ,[removes a nail from the floor and jumps inside. SpongeBob puts a cork in the hole, turns off a projector, making the whales disappear, and gets Mr. Krabs out of the robot arm],

,Patrick:, Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?
,Squidward:, ,[gulps], Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry.
,Patrick:, This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance, messy pants, ticklish rib cage, severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail will turn you into... A zombie.
,Squidward:, ,[freaks out; screams, then runs off crying loudly.],
,Patrick:, ,[To SpongeBob], You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important. ,[both gasp once they see that Gary is missing], There's a mad snail on the loose! ,[runs off screaming],
,SpongeBob:, Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?!
,Patrick:, ,[runs up to a couple], That mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie.
,Fish:, Jeepers, what's with all the lunatics? ,[Gary crawls up],
,Fish's Wife:, Oh look, honey, isn't he the cutest? ,[Gary is panting],
,Fish:, Come here, little buddy. ,[pets Gary], He's just adorable. ,[Gary bites him], Mad snail disease is real! I'm a zombie. I've been bitten by a mad snail. I've got mad snail disease!
,Fish #2:, Then I've got it! A snail just bit me, too! ,[all screaming],
,Frank:, ,[screams; all look at their hands and scream],
,Johnny:, We interrupt this program to bring you a news blast. Terror in a shell. This just in... fear and disease is spreading like wildfire as a killer snail has been biting the citizens of Bikini Bottom infecting them with... mad snail disease. ,[(two scream sound effects are played at once. One of them is from the  "",Hooky,"" episode, the other one is one audible from the show Rocko's Modern Life.], Ask any old fish on the street and they'll tell you that germs enter through the bite radius, traveling upstream until the entire host body is full of... mad snail disease. ,[the same sound effect from above can be heard], We now take you to Action News Reporter Perch Perkins live on the scene.
,Perch Perkins:, Perch Perkins here with the first victim of this epidemic. Tell me Mr Tentacles, when did you first begin to suspect that you were a zombie?
,Squidward:, Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms.
,Frank:, ,[wearing red shirt], Hey, I was bitten by a snail. I kinda feel off balance. ,[falls over], Whoa.
,Perch Perkins:, Hey, I have a ticklish rib cage, too. And I haven't even been bitten.
,Frank:, ,[wearing red shirt], Oh no, it's spreading through the air! ,[all scream],
,Perch Perkins:, Well, you heard it here first. We're all doomed to a horrible demise. Thanks to a diseased snail. ,[screams and runs around in circles; TV static then back on; still screaming],
,SpongeBob:, ,[shocked due to the news; people screaming], Gary? ,[horn honking], I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction.
,Squidward:, ,[moaning], I'm a zombie... here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh! ,[moaning like a zombie. Some of the people moan and are zombies. SpongeBob screaming and takes a bus; SpongeBob still screaming and running to the Krusty Krab], It's locked! ,[all moaning], Somebody let me in.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry. ,[uses key to open],
,Frank:, Stop! You can't let anyone in!
,Mr. Krabs:, But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties.
,Frank:, They're zombies. They only want to dine on our flesh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck.
,Frank:, I don't work here.
,SpongeBob:, But Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob.
,Mr. Krabs:, But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?
,SpongeBob:, Could a voracious flesh-eater do this? ,[he uses his body to slide through the door],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, it's you.
,SpongeBob:, That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten.
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right.
,Patrick:, Or is it?
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,Patrick:, I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombie-fied. Just look at how yellow he is.
,SpongeBob:, Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet? ,[shows picture],
,Patrick:, Perhaps not. Now, I got my eye on you!
,Old Man Jenkins:, If you could pull out your eye and put it on him, wouldn't that make... You a zombie too?
,Patrick:, You're right. ,[alarmed], I'm a zombie!
,Old Man Jenkins:, Who's to say we're not all zombies?! ,[all scream],
,Gary:, Meow. ,[slithers out of the kitchen],
,All:, The snail!
,SpongeBob:, Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy.
,Harold:, No, don't get near it. Oh, the pity of it all!
,Evelyn:, ,[to Harold], I can't watch. ,[faints into Harold's arms],
,SpongeBob:, All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail. ,[screaming after Gary bites him], Gary... ,[sniffling], How could you?
,All:, ,[gasp],
,Harold:, SpongeBob's been infected by his own pet snail. Oh, the irony! Quick, we must quarantine that infected snail before he bites every last Bikini Bottomite. Let's get the snail!
,All:, Yeah!
,SpongeBob:, No, don't hurt him.
,Harold:, Hand over the snail.
,Mr. Krabs:, It's... for his own good, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, No, I won't let you touch Gary.
,Harold:, Stop the madness, man. The Mad Snail Disease ends now. Seize the snail!
,Doctor Gill Gilliam:, Halt! Did someone say 'Mad Snail Disease'? Is that what all this fuss is about?
,Patrick:, Yeah. What do you know about it?
,Doctor Gill Gilliam:, Funny you should ask. Allow me to introduce myself. Doctor Gill Gilliam. S.D.E. and S.E.
,SpongeBob:, S.D.E. and S.E.?
,Doctor Gill Gilliam:, Snail disease expert and snail expert. I'm sorry to break this to you all, but that 'mad snail disease' you're talking about, it doesn't exist.
,All:, Huh?
,Doctor Gill Gilliam:, That's right. No such thing. It's an old urban legend. A myth.
,Patrick:, Well, does that mean we're not zombies?
,Doctor Gill Gilliam:, Of course not. No one is. It's just mass hysteria.
,Nathiel:, But what about my severely untrimmed...
,Doctor Gill Gilliam:, Those are only moderately untrimmed. All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments.
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding Gary back], Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?
,Doctor Gill Gilliam:, Hmmm... mm-hmm. Ahh! The problem's right here. He's got a little splinter in his foot. ,[The doctor pulls out the splinter and Gary is now back to normal, a zoom out shows that the splinter was one of Squidward's logs, just as an example], I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, Good ol' Gary's back. ,[Sandals, Bill, Nathaniel, Charlie and VB get mad when Squidward comes in and keeps acting like a zombie], Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?
,Squidward:, Oh, yes I am. ,[Nathaniel walks up to order], Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
,Mr. Krabs:, All's well that ends well.
,[Gary bites Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ow! ,[tries to kill the pain, then looks at Gary],

,Kid #1:, It's too high. I can't!

,Nurse:, ,[blows whistle], Shady Shoals residents, out of the pool!
,Old Man #1:, I pooped.
,Clarabelle:, Come along, Mortimer. ,[blinks her old eyes and pulls Patrick out of the pool],
,Patrick:, Huh? ,[notices his wrinkled up body], Oh. Huh? I'm covered in wrinkles.
,Clarabelle:, Oh, we all are, dear. I call them oldie foldies. ,[flips her flabby arm], Hurry, Mortimer. Shady Shoals is serving prune ice cream today.
,Patrick:, Dah! Ice cream, oh, oh! ,[runs up to the bus, knocking over Clarabelle and an old man], Wait for me! ,[gets in the bus and it drives away, dragging Clarabelle and the old man in the back],

,Marco:, ,[grumbles and grabs SpongeBob], Yeah, I'm-a Marco! What do you want?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I don't want you. I want Patrick.
,Marco:, Then stop a-yellin' my name! ,[drops SpongeBob and leaves],
,SpongeBob:, Ugh. ,[softly], Marco.
,Larry:, ,[through megaphone while holding and old man licking a lollipop], Attention, everyone. We found a lost elderly gentleman who goes by the name of Mortimer. Can anyone claim him? ,[gets no answer and stuffs Mortimer in a lost and found box],
,[The bus drives up to Shady Shoals where it is about to drop the senior citizens off.],
,Patrick:, Come on, let's move it! I want prune ice cream.
,Senior Citizens:, ,[gets picked up by Patrick], Ohh.
,[Patrick carries the senior citizens into Shady Shoals and flops to the ground. The senior citizens cheer and Patrick pulls himself together.],
,Clarabelle:, Mortimer, ice cream time.
,Patrick:, ,[gets up], Ahh! ,[pants as he runs to the table, pushes everyone aside and eats the prune ice cream; he belches out the three bowls then starts to feel pain in his head], Brain freeze!
,[Patrick's head opens and his brain is covered in ice and snow. Patrick passes out unconscious on the floor.],
,Nurse:, Clear! ,[zaps Patrick with the defibrillator], Clear! ,[zaps Patrick's brain with the defibrillator, but his brain ignites fire; she whimpers and backs away],
,[Patrick's brain is burnt to a crisp and the smoke wakes Patrick up.],

,Clarabelle:, Eh?
,Mary:, Ehh?
,Patrick:, ,[his face is on the blanket], Eh. ,[rips his face off with the blanket], Oh. ,[laughs with Mary and Clarabelle],
,[The scene changes with Patrick, who is getting old and wrinklier at that time, playing shuffleboard with some old men. He gets a turn, but his arm falls off. He and the two old men share a laugh.

,Old lady #1:, Gotcha! ,[she and Patrick laugh],

,[Marco grumbles and climbs down the fire escape.],
,SpongeBob:, Marco!
,Marco:, You! What I tell youse about-a yellin' my name?
,SpongeBob:, Ahh! I-I don't remember. Um, sometimes it helps me to remember if I go into a trance. ,[rubs his head and shows his brain then a white farmhouse], I'm seeing a small farmhouse painted white. Does that have any significance to you?
,Marco:, My parents had a white farmhouse.
,SpongeBob:, What's this? A baby has been born. A boy. There is much happiness.
,Marco:, That's-a me. I was-a born there.
,SpongeBob:, They are about to name the boy...

,Patrick:, ,[wakes up], Do I know you, young man?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, it's me. Remember? ♪Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?♪

,Patrick:, SpongeBob SquarePants!
,SpongeBob:, ,[plays the final notes with his nose like a flute and laughs], The one and only. Okay, now it's your turn to call Marco Polo.
,Patrick:, Whoa-oh, I can't do that. I'm all wrinkled now. I do old stuff. ,[his forehead and eyebrows fall on his face],
,SpongeBob:, Old stuff? Like what?
,Patrick:, ,[lifts up his forehead and eyebrows], Check it out. ,[shows SpongeBob a rocking chair], This is called doddering. ,[slowly dodders to the rocking chair], Oh, here's another thing I do now. It's called gumming. ,[smacks his gums and lips], Neat, huh? ,[laughs], Now, uh, this part's really fun. It's called complaining. ,[grabs Joshua], These kids today, they don't know diddly squat!

,SpongeBob:, Wow, Patrick, those are all great things, but wouldn't you rather go jellyfishing? ,[holds up a jellyfishing net],
,Patrick:, ,[imagines a jellyfish and it stings him], Ohh! No, that hurts.
,SpongeBob:, We could build sand castles. ,[holds up a toy shovel],
,Patrick:, ,[imagines a sand castle and someone kicks it in Patrick's neck], It's not structurally sound.
,SpongeBob:, Well, how 'bout blowing bubbles? ,[holds up a bottle of bubble with a bubble wand], Nothing bad about a bubble]
,Patrick:, ,[imagines a bubble and it floats in front of him], Ooh. ,[it pops in his face], Are you trying to kill me, son?

,Senior Citizens:, No, he wasn't. ,[climbs in the cushion coffin], We are not young.
,SpongeBob:, Come on, people. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you're rotting fish. You're still vital, full of life. Fresh.
,Old Man #2:, Fresh, you say? Ahh. ,[his mouth rips off],
,[SpongeBob pulls Patrick and the senior citizens out of Shady Shoals as they sit on a rug. He drags them to a nearby coral tree.],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, you young-at-hearters, today you are gonna climb that tree.
,[Patrick and the senior citizens get up and attempt to climb it.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[through megaphone], Yes, yes, that's right! Put those flabby arms to use! Laugh at your lumbago! Cackle at your cataracts!
,[Patrick and the senior citizens try their best, but couldn't due to being old and frail. One old man falls down from the branch and crumbles to dust. SpongeBob sweeps the old man up and revives him by watering him with a watering can.],
,Old Man #3:, Is it nap time yet?
,SpongeBob:, Nope! It's time for the dance party! Everybody on board.
,[Patrick and the senior citizens sit on the rug and SpongeBob drags them away. The scene changes to dancing arena where SpongeBob attempts to help Patrick and the senior citizens dance.],
,SpongeBob:, Are you ready to get down?
,Patrick and the senior citizens:, Yeah. ,[get down on the floor and fall asleep],
,SpongeBob:, No, not like that. Like this! ,[turns on ragtime music],
,[Patrick and the senior citizens stand up and dance to the ragtime music.],
,Patrick:, Now-now-now-now you're talking.

,Patrick:, Oh, what's happening?
,[Patrick and the senior citizens pass out unconscious to the floor.],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, clear! ,[zaps the floor with the defibrillator. reviving Patrick and the senior citizens],
,[Patrick and the senior citizens laugh and Patrick zaps his head with the defibrillator. The scene changes to SpongeBob dragging Patrick and the senior citizens across the sidewalk.],
,SpongeBob:, Isn't it great to get outdoors with the fresh air and sunshine?
,Old Lady #2:, Stop this rug! Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
,Patrick and the senior citizens:, Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
,SpongeBob:, Bunny Buns? That's a good idea! Nothing makes people feel young like arcade games, grease and sugar.
,[Inside Bunny Buns, children are riding on kiddie rides, eating pizza, playing arcade games, and swimming in the ball pit. Several kids are watching the animatronic animal stage show. Patrick is whacking the animatronic badger with his cane.],
,Patrick:, You're coming in too fast on the bridge and you're blowing clams! ,[whacks the robot's head off and lands on a kid's pizza; the kid cries and Patrick listens through an ear trumpet], Now that's what I call jazz!
,SpongeBob:, ,[pushes Patrick away], Ha, ha. So sorry. Let me just take this. ,[takes the severed robot head and leaves],
,[One old man is playing Bunny Bash while using Joshua as the hammer. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags him away again. An old couple attempts to eat pizza, but they end up pulling their dentures out.],

,Old Man #1:, ,[gets squirted by Patrick], Whoa! ,[flies into a skee ball machine and comes out in ticket form], 23 skidoo!
,SpongeBob:, Oh. ,[groans as he straightens out the old man],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], SpongeBob! ,[struggles to swim in the ball pit], I'm drowning! ,[sinks into the ball pit],
,SpongeBob:, I'm coming, Patrick! ,[jumps into the ball pit and pulls Patrick out],
,[SpongeBob performs CPR and makes him spit out several balls and Joshua. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags her away again.],
,Patrick:, Thanks, old-timer.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, you're welcome. What, who are you calling old-timer? ,[looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself getting old and wrinkly], Whoa. Where have the years gone? ,[he and Patrick walk slowly together, until he falls flat on the floor], I'm losing steam. ,[spews out steam from his holes],
,Patrick:, Wait, hey, man. Don't make a scene in front of all my old friends. ,[SpongeBob's steam turns Patrick's skin moist and his cane disappears, making him young again], Oh. ,[looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself young again], Ohh. Now I can't dodder.
,[The scene changes back to Shady Shoals and SpongeBob is resting on a rocking chair with a heart monitor next to him. Patrick walks up and puts a blanket onto SpongeBob.],
,Patrick:, Here you go, old friend. ,[the heart monitor stops beeping], Huh? ,[groans in sadness and covers SpongeBob up to his face, thinking he has died],
,SpongeBob:, ,[wakes up and feels young again], Gotcha!
,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.],
,Patrick:, You got me again. ,[laughs],
,[Meanwhile, Clarabelle is playing Marco Polo with several senior citizens near the coral tree.],
,Clarabelle:, Marco.
,Old Man #3:, Polo.
,Clarabelle:, Marco!
,Marco:, ,[climbs down the tree], Oh, that's it! I said I was-a gonna clobber the next-a person what-a calls my name!
,Clarabelle:, No one clobbers Clarabelle! ,[flexes her flabby arms and her biceps forms into a scooter with rocket boasters on it; then she gives Marco a knuckle sandwich and sends him flying off distance, exploding on impact], Oh, Marco? ,[takes out an ear trumpet to hear],
,Marco:, ,[weakly], Polo.

Now I am utterly normal. ,[he smiles showing his teeth with no buck tooth. Cuts to a customer biting into his flat Krabby Patty,?but all he is eating is paper. He takes it out of his mouth],
,Robbie Fish:, Ugh, you know what? That ain't right. I will never spend my money here again.
,Mr. Krabs:, Never?
,Mevis:, Come on, you guys, these patties aren't worth the paper they're printed on.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait, where're you going? ,[paper Krabby Patty lands on his nose], SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads. ,[customers are row out of the restaurant in boats],
,SpongeBob:, Maybe this thing is out of ink.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[sighs], No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart in it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull.
,SpongeBob:, What you call dull I call normal.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can I want you out of my place!

,SpongeBob:, Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal.
,Squidward:, Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house.
,Squidward:, You know, SpongeBob, it's okay to be a little different. ,[slurps his tea],
,SpongeBob:, And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go. ,[SpongeBob turns Squidward's face into a real live Squidward face], See? Looking normal already.
,Squidward:, What the...?
,SpongeBob:, One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. ,[Squidward kicks him out of his house],
,Squidward:, And stay out of my home! ,[slams the door then looks in the mirror and pokes his nose a little],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, what happened? I lost my job and my best friend and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus... ,[groans], and clench. ,[groans so much his eyes pop out], Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional. ,[Cuts to Patrick's house],
,Patrick:, ,[tongue is twisted around], Look at my tongue. ,[tongue un-twists itself and Patrick laughs],
,SpongeBob:, That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again.
,Patrick:, Huh, I don't think you have what it takes.
,SpongeBob:, Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me, again.
,Patrick:, It won't be easy, but I'll do it.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, thank you, Patrick!
,Patrick:, But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and I'll need you to remove your trousers. ,[Cuts to people laughing at SpongeBob who is only in his underwear],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now.
,Patrick:, ,[spraying water], Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird. ,[throws SpongeBob onto the streak of water], See you on the other side, buddy! ,[SpongeBob grunts as both Patrick and SpongeBob are sliding on a water trail that lead to a ramp on a flatbed truck that launches them into the Bikini Bottom Zoo],
,Susie:, Mommy, mommy... what are those things?
,Shubie:, Those are undesirables, honey. We only talk to normal people! ,[Shubie and her two kids walk off],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger. ,[Cuts to Jellyfish Fields where SpongeBob is riding on Patrick's back like a horse and catches a jellyfish in the net. Another crater comes back. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick licking the sand and as SpongeBob is licking, his nose grows back to normal size. Cuts to Patrick and SpongeBob standing on their hands], Talk backwards.
,SpongeBob:, Tap erus uoy era? ,[SpongeBob's legs and arms are back to normal. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick eating secret Krabby Sauce with their feet. SpongeBob's teeth appear. But then something is happening to SpongeBob],
,Patrick:, It's happening. The final transformation. ,[SpongeBob transforms back into his normal state],
,SpongeBob:, Huh?
,Patrick:, What happened?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal.
,Patrick:, No!
,SpongeBob:, ,[crying], I don't wanna be normal. ,[knock on door],
,Patrick:, Go away.
,SpongeBob:, Normal is not worth it.
,Patrick:, We're in mourning. ,[Patrick also starts crying in despair],
,Squidward:, ,[Patrick's rock begins to open], It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob. ,[Squidward is in a normal state], Hi, how are ya? ,[SpongeBob is so scared and shocked at how Squidward looks that he screams himself back into his regular self],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape.
,SpongeBob:, Wow, I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life.
,Squidward:, Wonderful weather we're having, hm?
,SpongeBob:, It sure is, buddy. It sure is. ,[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh whilst the episode ends],

The story you're about to see happened ,[a realistic tidal wave blackens the screen], on one weird and unusual day, when the town crossed over into... ,[the words ""The Tidal Zone"" appears on screen], ""The Tidal Zone.""
,[Eerie images of SpongeBob and Squidward are shown floating in ""The Tidal Zone."" An alarm clock and Patrick are shown to float in ""The Tidal Zone."" Patrick swallows the alarm clock whole and ""The Tidal Zone"" fades back to reality where Patrick is at the bus deport.],
,Patrick:, This, sir, is penosterous! I demand restitution! ,[as he pounds on the counter, puts on gloves, removes one, and smacks the clerk with it.],
,Clerk:, Sir, I've told you we don't sell balloons!
,Patrick:, I want to speak to the manager. I bet he knows where the balloons are.
,[The clerk slams the window in Patrick's face. A bus pulls over and opens its door. Patrick pulls himself out with the window still stuck to his face.],
,Patrick:, Balloons? Aw, it's just a stupid old bus.
,Clerk:, Give me that! ,[pulls the window off of Patrick's face],
,Tram's Travels Tour Guide:, On behalf of Tram's Travels, I'd like to welcome you to Bikini Bottom. I'd also like to take a moment to familiarize you with the area. The restrooms are to the left. ,[the tourists run over to the restrooms, running over their tour guide in the process], Hey, I have to go too! ,[runs over to the restrooms],
,Patrick:, ,[walks over and sees the tour guide's hat on the ground], Hey, mister? You dropped your hat.
,Tram's Travels Tour Guide:, ,[wailing while waiting outside of the restrooms], Oh, come on!
,Patrick:, Okay, I'll...,[puts on the tour guide's hat], keep it warm for you. ,[looks at his reflection in the window],
,Patrick's Reflection:, I could be a tour guide!
,Patrick:, Ooh, I could be a tour guide?
,Patrick's Reflection:, That's what I said!
,[The door opens and Rube walks out, taking pictures with his camera.],
,Rube:, ,[chuckling], Wow! Everything is so amazing! Hello, are you the tour guide?
,Patrick:, ,[looks at the hat and gets an idea], Uh...uh! Yes, I am. ,[Rube takes pictures while Patrick is talking], All right, everyone, settle down. My name is Patrick and I'll be your tour guide to the wonderful world of Bikini Bottom. Please take small children firmly by the hand. And we're walking, we're walking...
,[Patrick begins his ""tour"" and begins walking as Rube follows him. The real tour guide is seen knocking on the restroom door.],
,Tram's Travels Tour Guide:, I feel like I'm gonna burst! ,[puffs up like a balloon and explodes into pieces. Rube takes a picture of the blown-up tour guide. The scene changes to Patrick showing Rube a large stone.],
,Patrick:, Our first landmark is the kissing stone of the ancients. It is said to bring good luck to all who smooch it. ,[kisses the stone],
,[The stone comes to life.],
,Stone:, ,[gasps angrily], Brash! ,[punches Patrick furiously in the face which literally lands on a nearby trashcan and storms off as Rube takes pictures],
,Rube:, Amazing!
,[The scene changes to Patrick showing Rube a dug-up hole in the sand.],
,Patrick:, Another ancient and mysterious landmark is the hole that I dug yesterday.
,[Rube takes a picture as Patrick flips himself into the hole.],

,[Rube takes pictures as Patrick's bellybutton eats the kid's ice cream cone.],
,Ryan:, Hey!
,Rube:, Amazing!
,[The kid kicks Patrick in the stomach, which makes him cough up the ice cream cone and resumes eating it while Rube continues to take pictures. The scene changes to Patrick showing Rube an overweight man watching television with his twin daughters.],
,Patrick:, This guy called me a bad word once.
,Dad:, ,[Shocked to see Patrick],Huh? You were trying to eat my mailbox!
,Patrick:, I thought it was meatloaf!
,Dad:, Kids, escort these ""gentlemen"" to the door.
,Kids:, With pleasure!
,[The man cackles on the TV as his kids pick up Patrick and Rube.],
,Rube:, Amazing!
,[Rube takes pictures as the kids kick him and Patrick out of their house.],
,Kids:, ,[shouts victoriously], Boo-yah!
,[Patrick and Rube fly through the air.],
,Patrick:, Coming up ahead is the home of SpongeBob SquarePants, the fry cook.
,Rube:, Oh, my gosh. That sounds excitin'! ,[takes pictures],
,[Patrick and Rube begin to descend downward.],
,Patrick:, We have begun our descent.
,[Patrick and Rube crash to the ground.],
,Patrick:, ,[dizzily], Everyone please gather all your belongings and follow me single file.
,Rube:, ,[takes more pictures], Amazing!
,[The scene changes to Patrick showing Rube SpongeBob, who is sleeping in his bed.],
,Patrick:, This is my best friend SpongeBob. As you can see, he sucks his thumb when he sleeps. ,[sucks SpongeBob's thumb], Oh—wait, that's me. ,[sucks SpongeBob's thumb as the alarm clock in his stomach rings; he punches his stomach to stop the ringing],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sleepily], Yes, I like sweet potatoes, thank you.
,Patrick:, My internal alarm clock says it's time for morning lunch. Everyone, follow me. And we're tiptoeing... tiptoeing...
,[Patrick heads out of SpongeBob's room as Rube takes pictures.],
,Rube:, Amazing.
,[Patrick and Rube eat food in SpongeBob's kitchen with Gary.],
,Patrick:, The tour will resume shortly, everyone. And also, uh, I think the mayo is spoiled.
,[Rube and Gary spit mayonnaise in Patrick's face. Patrick wipes some of the mayonnaise off his face with his sandwich and resumes eating. The scene changes to Squidward taking a shower in his bathroom. Just as Squidward begins to walk out, Patrick and Rube stand in front of him.],
,Patrick:, This is Squidward the cashier.
,[Squidward screams and falls over into his bathtub while Rube takes pictures.],
,Patrick:, And yes, those moles are huge.
,[Squidward gets up and becomes angry while his skin turns red. Rube's camera lens shrink down as Squidward looks closer at them.],
,Rube:, Amazing?
,[Squidward tosses both Patrick and Rube out through the eye windows.],
,Squidward:, And stay out! ,[shuts his windows, his front door, the front of his house, and the flower cloud in the sky in complete anger],
,SpongeBob:, ,[shouts], Late for work, late for work. Late for work. ,[runs over two mountains that are shaped like Patrick and Rube], Late for work, late for work!
,[The alarm clock rings in Patrick's stomach again.],
,Patrick:, Ooh, time for second lunch! ,[hops on top of Rube], Everyone, follow that Bob! ,[whacks Rube in the buttocks], Yah! ,[gets carried by Rube], And we're running. We're running...
,[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab.],
,Patrick:, This is the world-famous Krusty Krab! ,[unhooks the ribbon to allow Rube to enter the restaurant],
,[Patrick hooks the ribbon back on and enters the restaurant. Two girls walk up to the doors and trip over the ribbon as Rube takes pictures. Patrick catches Plankton who is attempting to steal a Krabby Patty again.],
,Plankton:, Hey!
,Patrick:, Now, this is Plankton, who's always trying to steal the Krabby Patty. So, we step on him! ,[he flicks Plankton off the patty and stomps on him.],
,Plankton:, ,[shrieking], Ouch!
,Patrick:, Try it, everyone. It's fun.
,Rube:, Oh, my goodness. Can I?! ,[he steps on and smears Plankton left to right, and Plankton screams in pain.], That is fun!
,Patrick:, Next stop is the Krusty kitchen.
,[Patrick walks to the kitchen while Rube follows him and continues taking pictures of smashed Plankton. He steps on Plankton once more, and Plankton moans. An old woman walks by and squishes him again with her heels, a tough-looking fish crushes him with spiked boots (and he temporarily sticks), and an old fish in a wheel chair squashes him for a sixth time, smearing him even more with his chair. Plankton continues to shriek in agony. Then the scene cuts to SpongeBob preparing Krabby Patties in the kitchen.],
,Patrick:, If you look to your left, you'll see SpongeBob preparing his fresh and delicious ingredients to be cooked alive.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, just doing my thing. ,[giggles],
,Rube:, That's amazing! ,[takes pictures],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, shucks, I'm just getting warmed up. ,[creates various things with the patties while Rube takes pictures], Uh-huh! Yeah! Eh, eh? ,[forms a camera with the patties], Ooh! ,[takes a picture of Rube],
,[The scene changes to Patrick showing Rube the toilets in the restroom.],
,Patrick:, And this magical place is where all the food ends up. ,[grabs some toilet paper as Rube takes pictures], And if you do this... ,[stuffs toilet paper in the toilet, flushes it and the toilet start overflowing], This happens!
,[The water spats out of the restaurant's chimney as Mr. Krabs kicks Patrick and Rube out.],
,Mr. Krabs:, And stay away from me toilets!
,Rube:, Gol, this is the best tour I've ever taken!
,Patrick:, And the best is yet to come!
,Rube:, Oh!

,Patrick:, You'll miss everything on your right.
,[The scene changes to Sandy planting vegetables in her treedome.],
,Sandy:, ,[humming], Oops, almost forgot my plant food. ,[runs in her tree],
,[Patrick and Rube are seen on top of her treedome.],
,Patrick:, Under your belly is the outside of Sandy's treedome.
,Rube:, It's so beautiful. I wish we could see the inside.
,Patrick:, ,[chuckles], Don't worry. I have a key. ,[takes out a key and creates a hole underneath them], Everyone, watch your step. ,[stomps on the glass and they fall inside the treedome], Sandy Cheeks and her tree both have roots in Texas. The dome overhead was designed to keep out the water. ,[he and Rube walk as Rube takes pictures], This makes the air too dry to survive in... ,[begins wheezing as he and Rube start drying up], For water-breathers like us. Luckily, we all have on our water helmets, or else we'd be in big trouble right about now. ,[he and Rube laugh as they're both completely dried up], Uh-oh! ,[they run up to the top of the treedome], And we're running, we're running! 'Cause we're expiring, expiring! ,[he stomps on the glass and they flip themselves back outside in the water, where they can breath again; the alarm clock in his stomach rings again],
,Rube:, Ooh, it's time for third lunch.
,Patrick:, Everyone, follow my belly.
,[Patrick and Rube slide downward on the treedome. The glass begins to break open.],
,Sandy:, Aw, looks like you plant critters could use a little water. ,[water pours down from the hole above Sandy], Whoa! ,[swims up and sees Patrick and Rube walks off; gargling], Patrick!
,[The scene changes to Floater's Cemetery.],
,Patrick:, This will probably be the last stop on our tour. ,[Rube takes pictures of the tombstones], Each one of these gravestones has an amazing secret underneath. ,[spookily], There's people living down there! ,[pushes a doorbell-like button on a tombstone that reads ""R.I.P. Here lies Ol' Ribeye."" A skeleton crawls out of the ground and roars.],
,Ol' Ribeye:, ,[pleasantly], Hello.
,Patrick:, This is my old pal Ribeye, everyone. Ribeye, this is everyone!
,Rube:, Wow, you're a dead guy. I love it! ,[shakes Ol' Ribeye's skeleton arm],
,Ol' Ribeye:, Well, any friend of Patrick's is a friend of...,[Rube breaks off Ol' Ribeye's arm; Ol' Ribeye growls angrily],
,Rube:, Oh, my goodness. ,[gulps], Let me try to... arm connected to the bone...,[slurps on the skeleton arm and attempts to push it back on Ol' Ribeye; the skeleton arm breaks and Ol' Ribeye becomes angrier],
,Patrick:, The management strongly advises that you... run away!
,[Patrick grabs Rube, and Ol' Ribeye begins chasing them around the cemetery, waking up a nearby skeleton in the process.],
,Skeleton Woman:, ,[picks up the phone], Hello, police? There's a disturbance at the cemetery and some of us are trying to sleep!
,Patrick:, ,[runs out of the cemetery with Rube], I'm sorry, Ribeye!
,Tram's Travels Tour Guide:, ,[on a real tour with the tourists in his bus], And on your left, the Bikini Bottom post office. On your right is a zombie chasing the guys who stole my hat!
,[The tour guide activates the accelerator in his bus and chases after Ol' Ribeye, Patrick, and Rube. Patrick and Rube continue to run away from Ol' Ribeye and they climb up on top of Patrick's rock. Ol' Ribeye crashes into Patrick's rock, breaking into pieces.],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you gotta hide! There's an angry mob... ,[sees an angry mob with police cars around Patrick's rock; deflatedly], Coming for you. They're here.
,Sandy:, They done busted my dome!
,Ol' Ribeye:, They ripped me up!
,Squidward:, They got pictures of me naked!
,Mr. Krabs:, No one wants to see your moles.
,Crowd:, Ew!
,Mr. Krabs:, Officer! ,[grabs Officer John and pushes him to Rube], That guy's camera took pictures of me Krabby Patty ingredients. And I want that film, before Plankton gets it!
,[Officer John pushes Mr. Krabs aside and grabs Rube's camera. He opens it and sees Plankton already inside of it, but the camera itself appears to not have any film in it.],
,Plankton:, Way ahead of you, Krabs. But there's no film in this camera at all.
,Everyone:, Huh?
,Officer John:, That's strange.
,[Everyone looks at Rube in confusion.],
,Rube:, Sorry for the misunderstandin', everybody, but I didn't take any pictures today. I don't even have a camera.
,[The camera disappears, with Plankton falling to the ground which surprises everyone.],
,Everyone:, ,[Shocked],Huh?!
,Rube:, In fact... ,[waves his arms as his voice fades], I'm not even here.
,[Rube disappears completely and everyone gasps in a shocking surprise.],
,Patrick:, ,[Nervously],Um...uh... ,[waves his hands in the air; it turns out that Rube was nothing more than an illusion], And we're backing away, and backing away, and backing away!
,[Everyone backs away in fear and runs off. The screen fades back into ""The Tidal Zone.""],
,French Narrator:, You see? I told you. Things always get weird in ""The Tidal Zone."" ,[cackling wickedly],

"[Episode starts with Squidward walking home. He places his keys on the table, and puts down a bag that says ""Nautical Mart"" on it. He then takes some stuff out],
,Squidward:, I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well at least my flowers survived the trip. ,[Squidward sniffs it, then SpongeBob's nose is in his nostril. Squidward screams, then sneezes him out], SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff!
,SpongeBob:, What about Patrick, does he have to find his own flowers too? ,[Patrick pops up from the flowers, and they die],
,Squidward:, What are you taking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!
,Patrick:, Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my... ,[human hands touch his face, then he talks sadly], ...face? ,[Patrick touches Squidward's nose, then his face, then SpongeBob's nose], You're right, Squidward! ,[cries],
,Squidward:, My floors! Think fast, squiddy. I've got your nose.
,Patrick:, You do?
,Squidward:, Yeah I've got it... ,[Squidward touches Patrick's face, and holds his thumb, looking like a nose], ...right here.
,Patrick:, Give me! Give it here!
,Squidward:, If you want it, you gotta go get it. ,[pretends to throw it, then they run outside, and Squidward shuts the door. They then look around],
,Patrick:, There! ,[Patrick picks up a shell], Well SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, that's not a nose that's a... ,[a hermit crab bites him and Patrick yelps], ...hermit crab.
,Patrick:, I guess I'll always be a noseless freak. ,[cuts to them walking down the street],
,SpongeBob:, It's not so ab-normal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses.
,Patrick:, Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs! ,[Mr. Krabs walks on screen sniffing around, then sees a penny],
,Mr. Krabs:, There ya are! ,[picks it up and continues sniffing],
,SpongeBob:, Well Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face.
,Patrick:, I can do that? ,[cuts to Patrick with a false nose tied on him],
,Surgeon:, Well, what do you think?
,Patrick:, Sorry doc, but I don't really think it's me.
,Surgeon:, That's a-okay. That's cool. As the lead surgeon here, I take a hypophetical oath. Which means I will not stop, I will not rest, I will not cut a single toenail, until the customer is 100% satified! So please, browse our extensive wall of noses! And I will patiently await your final decision.
,Patrick:, Okay! Let's see. Hmm ,[looks around],
,Surgeon:, Excellent choice! ,[puts him on a medical bed. Scene cuts to him walking out of the nose store, with a nose bandaged up],
,SpongeBob:, All right Patrick, let's unveal the new shanauze! ,[tries to pull off the bandages, but Patrick stops him],
,Patrick:, Wait, stop, careful SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages. ,[Patrick crushes his nose, then pulls off the bandages, then uses a cooking mixer, then a sander],
,SpongeBob:, There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy! ,[silence for a few seconds], Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose.
,Patrick:, I will! Now, how do I use this thing? ,[smells something], What is that smell? ,[walks over to a bakery], Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good! ,[sticks his face in and sniffs them],
,Fred:, Well, I guess I won't be eating those. ,[cuts to Squidward walking out of the Nautical Mart with more flowers],
,Squidward:, Let's see Patrick destroy these. ,[Patrick sniffs them all in his nose, then he is sitting on a lawn mower smelling the grass, then putting on deodorant, and sniffing his arm pit. He then smells some bread, and floats toward it. He then floats through a cloud of perfume a lady is putting on],
,Patrick:, All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good! ,[Patrick smells a bad smell, then falls], What is that horrible smell? ,[notices something], Onion rings? ,[sniffs them, then screams and covers his nose], The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells! ,[a bad smell taps him on the shoulder], What is it now? ,[Patrick sniffs some trash, then runs away from the stench], I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing. ,[runs into his rock, and the smell vanishes. Patrick sits in his chair], I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors. ,[Patrick smells a bad smell again], Bad smells are all around me! ,[takes a look at all the trash. His eyes then water up, and he runs outside], I cannot live in these conditions! ,[puts a mask on his nose, then gets some cleaning spray and a brush. He then runs to his rock to clean it],
,Narrator:, 48 hours later... ,[Patrick's house is really clean, and he is still cleaning],
,SpongeBob:, Hiya Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good.
,Patrick:, The smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable! ,[cries, then Squidward walks on screen],
,Squidward:, What's wrong with the pin head? ,[Patrick smells something, and screams],
,Patrick:, There's another one! No! I can't take it!
,Squidward:, Where do you think you're going?
,Patrick:, To do what should have been done long ago. ,[barges into Squidward's house, then smells something, and opens his fridge, revealing bad smelling cheese ,[Ädelost?],, then screams], Sweet Neptune, imported cheese! ,[runs off screen, then comes back with a mask and sack], This is inexcusable! ,[puts it in the sack], Yuck!
,Squidward:, What are you doing with my cheese?
,Patrick:, It's rotten garbage now. ,[throws it in the garbage, then blasts it with a rocket launcher], That's better.
,Squidward:, That was my cheese. It's ,supposed, to smell like that, kelp for brains!
,Patrick:, You are sick, Squidward! ,[Patrick smells another bad smell], There's that smell again! ,[Patrick looks out the window, and we see SpongeBob working out],
,SpongeBob:, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,[has trouble lifting the weight again], Come on SquarePants, ,be a man!, ,[lifts it up],
,Patrick:, You! ,[SpongeBob is scared, and drops the weight on him],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, help!
,Patrick:, ,[throws the weight off him], Oh, I'll help you all right! Help stop you polluting are world with your sweaty holes. ,[plugs up SpongeBob's holes with corks], There.
,SpongeBob:, I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform.
,Patrick:, Well you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob. ,[smells another bad smell], Smell's like, something greasy! ,[cuts to the Krusty Krab], Nobody move! I am ridding this place of it's disgusting stench, with these scented candles! ,[puts a candle on a table. Fred tries to eat a Krabby Patty, but can't],
,Fred:, ,[coughs], My mouth can't take these conflicting flavors! Agh! ,[walks away, then Patrick puts scented candles on every table],
,Patrick:, This air freshener should finish the job. ,[sprays it, then everyone coughs. Patrick then puts a candle on the cashier boat],
,Mr. Krabs:, What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers! ,[everyone leaves],
,Patrick:, Well good! No one should have to eat in this stench! ,[Mr. Krabs thinks Patrick works for Plankton],
,Mr. Krabs:, What? Why, I got a good mind to...
,Patrick:, Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got plenty more stink holes to swab clean.
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk! ,[Patrick walks outside, and Sandy walks past him],
,Sandy:, Hiya Pat. ,[Patrick sprays Sandy with the air freshener. Sandy screams, then coughs],
,Patrick:, Take a bath, fleabag! ,[cuts to the Krusty Krab. Where Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy, and SpongeBob are there],
,Mr. Krabs:, I've asked you all here, because we all face a similar problem. The problem, a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand!!! ,[all except SpongeBob agree], Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it!? ,[all, except SpongeBob agree again],
,Squidward:, Let's give him what for!
,Sandy:, Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail! ,[all, except SpongeBob agree again],
,SpongeBob:, ,[in thought bubble], Come on SpongeBob, ,be a man!, ,[talking], Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not now boy! We're in the middle of a public lishen! That no good, nose flartin...
,SpongeBob:, It is not Patrick's fault!
,All:, Huh?
,SpongeBob:, It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks! ,[cuts to them pushing a giant stinky ball toward Patrick's house, in air suits, so they won't smell it], Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom. ,[puts a nasty slimy messy pepper on the garbage ball], With a little raw sewage for good measure.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ata' boy! Now for the moment of truth!
,SpongeBob:, Yes sir! ,[knocks on Patrick's rock and runs away],
,Patrick:, Hello. ,[smells the bad smell, casing his nose to cough, then dry and shrivel out], No! ,[his nose than falls off, then vanishes], All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you. ,[runs away crying, then cuts to a cemetery], 
,SpongeBob:, ,[reading tombstone], Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. Rip. ,[referring to the R.I.P], Well this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it!
,Squidward:, Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone!

,Patrick:, Ugh! I hate that hat! ,[Patrick throws SpongeBob's hat, but it flies back onto SpongeBob's head], Fine, have it your way, hat! ,[Squidward walks out], Hmph. Looks like Squidward has time to play. Hey, Squidward!
,Squidward:, What? ,[puts on hat],
,Patrick:, Oh no! He's got the hat, too!
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then.
,Patrick:, I'll show you, SpongeBob! I'll get a job and a hat!
,[Cuts to the Krusty Krab, where a kid is adding ketchup to his fries],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa, whoa, that's enough, lad. What do ya think, I'm made of ketchup? Now run along, boy. ,[Notices a group of tourists], That sounds like... a band of roaming tourists. ,[Runs out of the Krusty Krab], Wait, come back! Don't ya wanna give me your money?! They're a slippery bunch. What do I have to do to catch 'em, stand around out here all day? ,[Notices Patrick], What are you doing there, Patrick? 
,Patrick:, Standin' around out here all day.
,[Mr. Krabs gets an idea],
,Mr. Krabs:, How would you like a job, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Oh boy, gimme my hat!
,Mr. Krabs:, You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign. ,[Mr. Krabs hands Patrick an arrow-shaped sign saying ""The Krusty Krab""], That's not too tough for ya, is it, boy?
,Patrick:, Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat. ,[Holds up the sign], How's this?
,Mr. Krabs:, Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all. ,[From inside the Krusty Krab], Hee hee hee.
,SpongeBob:, What's shakin', Mr. K?
,Mr. Krabs:, Your buddy, Patrick. I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, he is good.
,Mr. Krabs:, And look. He's about reel in his first customer.
,Harold:, Can you direct me to the Krusty Krab please? ,[Patrick holds the sign so it's pointing at the Chum Bucket. Harold walks into the Chum Bucket.],
,Mr. Krabs:, What does he think he's doing?! ,[Multiple fish walk past Patrick], They're walkin' right past him. ,[Runs outside to Patrick], Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy.
,Patrick:, Okay. ,[Hits a fish in the head with the sign],
,Mr. Krabs:, That ain't the kind of attention we need! Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something. ,[Spins the sign, causing it to fly out of Patrick's hands. Hands the sign back to Patrick], Just keep workin' on that one, eh, boy? Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl.
,Patrick:, Anything for my new hat.
,[Patrick sees tourists approaching, so he spins the sign very fast. The wind is so intense that a window opens, and a tourist's camera gets blown away],
,Mr. Krabs:, That's enough, Patrick!
,[Mr. Krabs and the tourists get blown away],
,Patrick:, I did it! Did you see that, Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, I saw it.
,Patrick:, Do I get my hat now?
,Mr. Krabs:, Ehhh... what the heck. It pays to advertise. ,[Gives Patrick a Krusty Krab hat],
,Patrick:, Yeah! Wheeee! ,[Then Patrick falls on his face, gets back up and falls down again],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?
,SpongeBob:, What's the matter, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Sometimes, when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand!
,SpongeBob:, He's nervous.
,Blue Fish:, Ha ha! Look at that guy! He can't even stand on his own two feet!
,Pink Fish:, Now that's that kind of mindlessness I'd pay money to see!
,[Mr. Krabs looks at them, then neck stretches out over to them],
,Mr. Krabs:, You mean, cash money?!
,Pink Fish:, Well, heck, yeah!
,Mr. Krabs:, Five dollars please. Alright.
,Mr. Krabs:, There's that sound again. They're loving it. Patrick, you've captured the attention of all these tourists with your ridiculous blackdoodle.
,Patrick:, I did?
,Mr. Krabs:, That's right, I think we've finally found a job for you that you're good at. Being an absolute buffoon! If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab. For just five dollars a head.
,[Bubble transition. Patrick falls and everybody is laughing and cheering],
,Squidward:, It's official. ,[everyone is still laughing], I hate everyone. ,[Patrick falls into the kitchen], You imbeciles think that's entertainment? Brace yourself for true entertainment! ,[plays his clarinet off-key],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Yeah.
,SpongeBob:, Are you okay?
,Patrick:, I'm fine.
,Pink fish:, Oh, that horrible noise! Let's get out of here. ,[customers begin to leave],
,Mr. Krabs:, What the barnacles is going on out here?
,Squidward:, I'm entertaining those heathens.
,Mr. Krabs:, We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much! ,[points to Patrick, but he's not there], Hey, where'd he go?
,SpongeBob:, ,[guiding Patrick, who has a tissue in his nose], That's it, buddy. Come on.
,Mr. Krabs:, What's with him?
,SpongeBob:, Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home.
,Mr. Krabs:, A bloody nose, eh? Do ya think I was born yesterday? He doesn't even have a nose. Now everybody, get back to work! I'm not running a happy factory here! ,[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick get back into there positions. to Patrick], Keep up the good work, Patrick!
,Patrick:, You got it, Mr. K!
,French Narrator:, 7 hours later...
,[Patrick is still falling and three customers are watching as Billy passes by],
,Billy:, Hey, is that guy still flopping?
,Customer:, Yeah! Amazing, isn't it?
,Billy:, Doesn't that get old?
,Customer:, He's got a point. Let's get out of here.
,Billy:, Me, too. I'm out. ,[everyone's leaving],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey! What's going on?
,Harold:, This guy's act is stale! We crave excitement!
,Mr. Krabs:, You want excitement? Well, what if I added a box? ,[puts Patrick on a box and he falls from it],
,Billy:, Sort of the same thing, really.
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, so what if he flopped from two boxes...? ,[adds another box, but the customers are still bored], ...into a cream pie? ,[puts cream pie in place],
,Patrick:, I like pie.
,Billy:, That, I'd pay to see! ,[crowd becomes excited],
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay, boy, let 'er rip! ,[Patrick falls headfirst into the pie. To Squidward], I'll be in the back counting me money. If the crowd gets bored, add some more boxes!
,Squidward:, Whatever.
,SpongeBob:, Hey, hat man... How are you feeling after your first day on the job?
,Patrick:, ,[feels morbidly disheveled], I feel like a million bucks... ,[falls over],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something! ,[Patrick mumbles incoherently], Okay, that's it! No best friend of mine is gonna suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck. I'm gonna go have a talk with him right-
,Patrick:, ,[Grabs SpongeBob], No! P-please, don't tell Mr. Krabs! You don't understand. For years, people have been telling me, “You're no good!” Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick! ,[He cries],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing.
,Patrick:, What's that, pal?
,SpongeBob:, Just be careful.
,Patrick:, ,[Hugs him], Thanks, pal.
,[Cut to SpongeBob walking to work],
,SpongeBob:, I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him. ,[Enters the Krusty Krabs, where Mr. Krabs is dressed in a suit and speaking through a megaphone],
,Mr. Krabs:, See the part time minimum wage employee fall from high atop this tower into this bucket of spiny sea urchins!
,Sandals:, This should be good.
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[Being hauled to top of the platform], Hi, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Mr. Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!
,Mr. Krabs:, It's okay, boy, he signed a waiver. ,[Shows it to him], Is he ready, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Ready!
,Mr. Krabs:, Okay! Get back, boy, you wouldn’t want to stain your uniform.
,Patrick:, Hey, good idea. Hey, Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt? ,[gives hat to Squidward], Thanks, buddy.
,Mr. Krabs:, Ready, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Ready! ,[Prepares to dive from the platform],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I can't watch! ,[Cries and blows his nose on Harold's fin],
,Harold:, Hey, ew!
,[tries to fall several times, fails],
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, Patrick! We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!
,Patrick:, I'm trying!
,[tries to fall several times, fails again],
,Patrick:, Argh, I think I'm stuck!
,Mr. Krabs:, Stuck? Well, if that don't … ,[Mumbles angrily and climbs a ladder to the platform], What's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?
,Squidward:, Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat.
,Mr. Krabs:, Patrick, why have you stopped falling?
,Patrick:, I dunno, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Well, you'd better figure it out. These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation. Now make with the cods-wallop, pal, understand?
,Patrick:, Uh-huh.
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't make me come back here.
,Patrick:, Hey, Squidward, d'you think you could, uh, you know … ,[Mimes pushing],
,Squidward:, You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. Okay, I'll do it! ,[He charges at Patrick, but misses and falls],
,Patrick:, Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat. Gotcha! All right, back where you belong, aaaah! ,[Grabs hat puts it on and falls],.
,Harold:, Great, we get to see two for the price of one!
,Mr. Krabs:, I don't think so.
,Harold:, Fine. ,[Pays Mr. Krabs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Thank you.
,Patrick:, Look, Squidward, I'm falling!
,Squidward:, Oh, I'm so happy for you!
,Patrick:, I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!
,[They crash into the urchin bucket],
,SpongeBob:, So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!
,Nat:, I paid to see two guys get maimed.
,Harold:, Yeah, I want a refund.
,Mr. Krabs:, Sorry, absolutely no refunds. ,[customers grumble], Hold on there, what's the big idea? ,[Customers tear up his clothes and money flies in the air], Grandma, help! ,[he is in his underwear. To Patrick], All right, you leave me no choice!
,Patrick:, You're giving me a raise?
,Mr. Krabs:, Not even close, you're fired. ,[takes Patrick’s hat, Patrick’s head has a lump], As long as I'm still standing, you’ll never wear this hat again.
,[Patrick sobs with his hands covering his eyes],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, you okay?
,Patrick:, Well, I guess it's back to being to No Hat Pat! ,[walks out sadly],
,Narrator:, Epilogue.
,SpongeBob:, ,[Walking home with Patrick], It's okay, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want.
,Patrick:, Really?
,SpongeBob:, Sure thing, pal.
,[gives Patrick his hat],
,Patrick:, ,[He puts it on and falls over and falls], Thanks, SpongeBob! You're the best!
,SpongeBob:, Anytime, pal! Anytime!

"[It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again],
,Narrator:, Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, ,[cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera], and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another ,[panicked], whole year of boating school! ,[Shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the cameraman is seen to have fallen over. Narrator groans.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[dazed], Whahappen? [,sic,]
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, nothing, SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. ,[writes on clipboard], Minus 20 more points.
,SpongeBob:, How many does that leave me with?
,Mrs. Puff:, Negative 224.
,SpongeBob:, How many more minutes left in the test?
,Mrs. Puff:, The test is over.
,SpongeBob:, That's enough time, I can make up those points! ,[SpongeBob is about to pull into reverse],
,Mrs. Puff:, No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me! ,[the boat rams into reverse and Mrs. Puff screams], It's too late, SpongeBob! ,[Mrs. Puff pleads SpongeBob to stop as he knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears],
,SpongeBob:, Okay, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?
,Mrs. Puff:, Six.
,SpongeBob:, Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?
,Mrs. Puff:, Six.
,SpongeBob:, ,[raising arms slowly], Whoo.
,Mrs. Puff:, Hundred. ,[SpongeBob stops],
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Mrs. Puff:, 600. You need 600 to pass. You got six.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry. I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! ,[he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward], Well, see you next Tuesday! ,[SpongeBob walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when SpongeBob crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike], Yeah! ,[singing], I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. ,[goes around in circles on his bike], One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! ,[Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[thinking], Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole! ,[starts to talk, when she does, she deflates to her normal size], Extra crediiiiit!
,SpongeBob:, What was that, Mrs. Puff? ,[Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy],
,Mrs. Puff:, Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! ,[laughing wildly], I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.
,SpongeBob:, What's extra credit?
,Mrs. Puff:, It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
,SpongeBob:, ,[singing], Oh….. ,[cut to SpongeBob at his desk],
,Mrs. Puff:, Now, are we ready for that extra credit?
,SpongeBob:, Extra credit!
,Mrs. Puff:, That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class, and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a ten-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.
,SpongeBob:, But I've learned so many things.
,Mrs. Puff:, Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started. ,[SpongeBob writes what she says], ""What I learned in boating school is…"" There! That's already seven words! Only three more!
,SpongeBob:, ,[writing], L… e… a… r… ,[pencil snaps], Oh, barnacles.
,Mrs. Puff:, What's wrong?
,SpongeBob:, Got to sharpen my pencil. ,[SpongeBob whistles as he walks to the sharpener. He then sharpens it multiple times to get just the right sharpness. Mrs. Puff begins to sweat. SpongeBob is finally satisfied and walks back to his desk], N… e… ,[pencil breaks again, he walks to the sharpener again, Mrs. Puff stops him, grabs the pencil and holds out a pen],
,Mrs. Puff:, Give me that! Here's a pen.
,SpongeBob:, A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. ,[walks back to desk singing], Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. ,[SpongeBob finishes], There.
,Mrs. Puff:, Fantastic, let me see it.
,SpongeBob:, No, wait! I changed my mind! ,[erases some stuff out],
,Mrs. Puff:, I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see. ,[SpongeBob jumps on top of his paper],
,SpongeBob:, Don't look! It's not ready.
,Mrs. Puff:, It's so simple, only ten words! ""What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity, ,[her eyes grow bulging veins], Blank!""
,SpongeBob:, I can do this! I can do this!
,Mrs. Puff:, ""What I learned in boating school is…!"" ""What I learned in boating school is…!""
,SpongeBob:, I can do this! I can do this! ,[starts to pant], Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? ,[screams], My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! ,[Mrs. Puff jumps on SpongeBob and forces the pen to push on the paper],
,Mrs. Puff:, You only need three… more… words! ,[the desk finally collapses and breaks, as Mrs. Puff falls on top of SpongeBob; Mrs. Puff gets off, and reaches for the essay], Okay, let me see what you've written. ,[SpongeBob grabs it],
,SpongeBob:, It's not ready yet.
,Mrs. Puff:, It's okay, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.
,SpongeBob:, No!
,Mrs. Puff:, Give it to me! ,[the two pull on it],
,SpongeBob:, No!
,Mrs. Puff:, Let me see it! ,[the page rips in half; Mrs. Puff grabs SpongeBob's piece and attempts to read it], ""What I learned in boating school is…"" Uh… ,[on the page, it says 'What I learned in boating school is how to drive.' 'School,' 'how' and 'drive are crossed out and below are pictures of a boat, SpongeBob and a jellyfish], Well, the rest doesn't matter! ,[throws the two pieces on the floor], You pass! ,[laughs], You pass!
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.
,Mrs. Puff:, That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.
,SpongeBob:, Really?
,Mrs. Puff:, Besides, here's your license. ,[gives it to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, My license! ,[licks it], It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[dragging him out the door], Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!
,SpongeBob:, Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants! ,[echoes], SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! ,[fades to a vision of Mrs. Puff's fears], La La La La! ,[he hits many pedestrians], La La La La! ,[he crashes through Harold and Frank],
,Fish:, ,[crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it], Ow!
,[A small birthday party is going on],
,Partygoers:, Harris, happy birthday! ,[SpongeBob runs over them], My leg!
,News Reporter:, So much destruction...this reporter asks, ""Why?"" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- ,[SpongeBob runs him over], Oof!
,SpongeBob:, La la la la!
,Reporter:, Let's- not- use that take. ,[Fades to reality],
,Mrs. Puff:, That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. ,[Later that night while walking home], Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
,[she opens the door and turns on the light to see the SquarePants family standing in the center of her living room with a huge round cake in the middle saying, ""Thank You, Mrs. Puff! ""],
,The SquarePants':, Surprise!
,SpongeBob:, To the greatest teacher ever!
,Mr. SquarePants:, Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. ,[kisses her hand for a long while],
,Mrs. SquarePants:, I think you made your point, dear.
,Mr. SquarePants:, Ahem. ,[blushes, and walks back to the family], Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!
,Mrs. Puff:, Well, I... Okay.
,Mrs. SquarePants:, We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...
,Mrs. Puff:, See what?
,Mr. SquarePants:, Ta-da. ,[reading back license plate], ""IM-RDY"".
,Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob:, A brand new boatmobile?!
,SpongeBob:, For me...? ,[faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat],
,Mrs. SquarePants:, Don't worry, Mrs. Puff... He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!
,Mrs. Puff:, What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins.
,[In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him],
,Mr. SquarePants:, You took quite a buster there, Son.
,SpongeBob:, What I learned in Boating School today is!
,Mr. SquarePants:, We're gonna have to hold off on the driving there for a while, son.
,Mrs. SquarePants:, That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat.
,[SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat],
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Boaty. ,[he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps], Boaty, you're cold! ,[he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door], Take my socks. ,[he jumps on the side and hugs it], Oh, Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! ,[he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear],
,Mrs. Puff:, I hope I still remember how to do this. ,[she takes out a purple balloon and blows it up. She then forms it into a balloon animal and snickers to herself], Oh yeah… ,[she starts the boat and drives off. What she doesn't know is that she's sitting on an asleep SpongeBob. He wakes up and sees the sky moving],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, I'm driving! ,[the two notice each other and scream. Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal. SpongeBob jumps up], Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing! ,[gasp], Oh my gosh, I know who you are!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[nervous], No, you don't! You don't know who I am!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, I do! I know that you're... a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray! ,[takes it out. He sprays, but the nozzle's pointed the wrong way, it gets in his eyes and he screams in pain], Somebody help me! Somebody help me! ,[Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat],
,Mrs. Puff:, Sorry, SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. ,[we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him],
,SpongeBob:, Give me back my boat! ,[SpongeBob finally catches up to Mrs. Puff and slaps his hand on the windshield. He grabs with both hands and jumps up. Mrs. Puff skids and swerves to get him off, but he's not budging], You'd better stop this boat! ,[Mrs. Puff slams the brake and SpongeBob falls to the ground. He's still hanging on and running], I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even… ,[gasps. He sees a sign reading…], Giant clams?! ,[so, SpongeBob is dragged through a field of giant clams. He comes out with a bunch of pieces missing from him], I'm… not… letting… go… even for… ,[gasps, when he sees another sign for…], Cheese graters?! ,[so, he skids through the cheese graters. Now he's just four yellow sponge strands with arms], If you think I'll let go for a little… ,[he then approaches the most dreaded sign of them all…], educational television?! Oh, no! ,[cut back to Mrs. Puff as she hears SpongeBob's scream],
,Mrs. Puff:, Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes! ,[she turns on the radio, which bears a striking resemblance to SpongeBob. It is SpongeBob, in the shape of a radio: his eyes are knobs, his mouth is the speaker, and so on],
,SpongeBob as Radio:, And now back to KRUD, with all of your personal ""you won't get away with stealing my car!"" hits. ,[Mrs. Puff screams as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on],
,Officer Rob:, Hey, look. ,[the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The cops scream in horror and clutch each other. While plummeting, SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are still brawling],
,SpongeBob:, I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were… ,[he rips off the ski mask, revealing who the culprit is], … Mrs. Puff? ,[SpongeBob flaps his lips in disbelief in a hypnotic background as the car crashes into the police car. Seconds later, the siren goes off. Later, SpongeBob is calling Mrs. Puff on the phone. Every time a person talks, it cuts to them], So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.
,SpongeBob:, So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?
,Mrs. Puff:, I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
,SpongeBob:, You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student ,[cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window],. And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?
,Mrs. Puff:, What's that? ,[pan out from the jail exterior],
,SpongeBob:, ,[from inside], Free driving lessons! ,[laughs],

"[The episode launches with SpongeBob reading at night in his pineapple home],
,SpongeBob:, ,[Reading], ""And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!"" ,[Closes the book and shudders], That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary? ,[Gary is literally stiff with fear. He quakes and falls on his side. SpongeBob picks him up and puts him into bed next to him], Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary? ,[Silence], Well, I guess I should turn off the light now. ,[He does so], Sure is dark. ,[He then sees a green monster with its brain protruding from his head in the dark. He gasps, screams and turns the light back on to reveal his inflatable raft chair. Roaring], Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark. ,[He turns off the light and hears a knocking on his window. He turns to it and sees that there's a shriveled green claw knocking], Whoa! Another monster! ,[He turns on his light to reveal it's a green coral branch floating in the current], Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of! ,[He hears a creaking sound as if his door had opened], What was that? ,[Turns the light on and off multiple times, seeing monsters over and over. The next day, at the Krusty Krab],
,Mr. Krabs:, Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob? ,[At that moment, a very drowsy and tired SpongeBob walks in. We see a close-up of his 5 o'clock shadow, bloodshot eyes, and droopy nose],
,Mr. Krabs:, Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today! ,[He walks into the kitchen and we hear a big clatter from outside. Mr. Krabs bursts through the kitchen door],

,SpongeBob:, Yes, it's working... ,[His eyes are unable to function properly, and shut. The french fries snap and go flying; SpongeBob screams],
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, thats enough! We've got fifty orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties.
,SpongeBob:, You want me to go in there? ,[It is dark, and frost drifts out. We pan in on the darkness, and Derek Iversen's head appears laughing while making an irritated expression. It seems to swirl around the doorframe. SpongeBob screams and clings to the kitchen ceiling],
,SpongeBob:, Save me, the darkness!
,[Mr. Krabs pries him off and pulls him down],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now, look here. Your work is starting to affect me profits. You need to get some shut-eye. Why don't you get yourself a night light?
,SpongeBob:, Night light?
,Mr. Krabs:, Yeah, boy! It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!
,SpongeBob:, Great idea, Mr. Krabs. ,[That night, SpongeBob browses Barg’N’Mart wearing his green pajamas and nightcap], Night light, night light... Oh! ,[Sees a whole wall of them in different shapes and colors at the end of an aisle. He sees one that he likes in particular], Oh, it's beautiful! ,[He walks up to Debbie Rechid drinking coffee at the register], Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?
,Debbie:, If I answer ""Yes"", will you leave the store sooner? ,[Cut back to SpongeBob's pineapple the same night. He plugs the night light into the outlet, and it illuminates the room slightly with a blue color],
,SpongeBob:, Now that I can see... ,[Jumps up and floats into bed], Woo-hoo! I can sleep! ,[He yawns and pulls over the covers. But suddenly, he screams again], I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom! ,[Screams again and returns to Barg’N’Mart then screams some more], Night light! Night light! ,[We see a shot of the Debbie, sipping coffee, as SpongeBob panics and darts to the back of the store. Then, he approaches the camera, night light in hand. He leaves a dollar on the counter], Oh, thank you, thank you! ,[At home, he plugs it in and sighs with relief. Then, he screams, seeing that his closet is dark. He runs back to Barg’N’Mart and we see the same shot as earlier. He runs home and puts a night light in his closet, but notices that his hallway is dark. He runs to and from and to and from Barg’N’Mart. Then, back at home, we see him plugging in the rest of the night lights. Screaming], There, there, there, and there. ,[Plugs one into an outlet in his medicine cabinet, under his fridge, in his toilet, and the back of Gary's shell], I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary. ,[He giggles. We see his whole living room is covered with a wall of millions of night lights], Now there's not one square inch of dark!
,Gary:, Meow.
,SpongeBob:, What was that, Gary?
,Gary:, Meow. ,[SpongeBob gasps and rolls his eyes in, like he did in ""Plankton"", to see his brain in the back of his head],
,SpongeBob:, You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me! ,[He turns on two flashlights and sticks them in his eye sockets. Outside his pineapple, the whole thing seems to be glowing orange from all the lights. It wakes Patrick up, and he walks outside],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob's having a party without me? ,[Walks over to SpongeBob's pineapple and knocks on the door], Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that. ,[SpongeBob opens the door and yanks Patrick inside],
,SpongeBob:, That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!
,Patrick:, Oh! ,[Patrick starts shuddering, and runs out. SpongeBob follows, but gets bounced back be the door, into his chair beside Gary],
,SpongeBob:, Wait, Patrick! ,[He hear a thundering sound and the ground shakes], What is that, Gary? ,[We see Patrick's rock smash through the wall and he slides it into SpongeBob's pineapple. Gary climbs on the armrest of SpongeBobs inflatable chair that he's in as its pushed into the other wall, where it pops. SpongeBob runs over to Patrick, who is panting and out of breath], Patrick, what are you doing!?
,Patrick:, Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light.
,SpongeBob:, You know what that means? ,[He somersaults into the air and dies a flip. He lands on a neon light that says ""Sleepover"". Confetti sprinkles from the roof, and SpongeBob's tongue rolls out like a noisemaker], Sleepover! ,[He jumps down, two sleeping bags in his hands. He bows and presents one to Patrick], Your sleeping bag, sir.
,Patrick:, Thank you, my good man. ,[Both unroll theirs in a regal manner, hop inside each of theirs, and dance to a sea shanty. When they're done, they laugh],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t...
,Both:, The dark! ,[They both scream and jump out of their sleeping bags. They stand on the other side of Patrick's rock, away from the hole, and under the lights. Meanwhile, at Squidward's house, the light reflects off of his picture frame, to his vanity-dresser mirror, to his hand-held mirror, and to his sky roof window, where it shines down on his eyes, covered by a sleeping mask. The light laser burns his eyes to a crisp],
,Squidward:, ,[screams], Burning! ,[He cools his eyes with his glass of water on his nightstand. Through his singed, blackened, and charred eyes, he looks out the window to see SpongeBob and Patrick. Back at the pineapple, SpongeBob and Patrick cling to each other, quivering and shivering],
,SpongeBob:, The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us... ,[Squidward darts in front of them],
,Squidward:, What are you two whimpering about? ,[Both scream, and Patrick jumps into SpongeBob's mouth for protection],
,Squidward:, It's me, Squidward, you idiots! ,[Patrick pops out of SpongeBob's mouth],
,Patrick:, Hi, Squidward!
,Squidward:, Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?
,SpongeBob:, But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-
,Squidward:, Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination. ,[Squidward starts nearing the exit, when Patrick drags behind him, tugging on the back of his nightgown],
,Patrick:, No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark! ,[The back of Squidward's nightgown tears off], Oh, why won't he listen? ,[Patrick cries over SpongeBob's shoulder, and SpongeBob consoles him by giving him a pat on the back],
,SpongeBob:, Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?
,Patrick:, Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!
,SpongeBob:, You said it, Pat! ,[They run outside and return with a huge neon sign],
,Patrick:, Quick, SpongeBob! Turn it on! ,[He does so. The light says ""Pinky's Dance Studio"" and has mechanical swaying legs with fishnet tights on], More lights! ,[They run out and return with a spotlight. Patrick shines it on his face, which causes it to become all crusty and starts to crumble], Now, SpongeBob! More lights! ,[They run to a lighthouse and Patrick tips it over onto SpongeBob. Then, they carry it into SpongeBob's house through the hole Patrick made, and slide it onto Patrick's rock. The whole house is elevated because of this, until it snaps in half and the bottom half lands like normal. Cut to Shady Shoals Rest Home, where superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy sit on a couch watching TV. Barnacle Boy has dozed off],
,Fish #1:, ,[On TV], The battery-operated spoon has saved me so much time.
,Mermaid Man:, ,[Sighs], This is what passes for info-tainment these days? ,[Sees the ""M"" light in the air and mistakes it for the ""MermaSignal"".], Sweet mother of Neptune's mother! Look, Barnacle Boy! A call to action! To the Invisible Boat Mobile! ,[Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple home],
,Patrick:, More lights, SpongeBob! More lights! ,[They crash into Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy],
,SpongeBob:, Mermaid Man!?
,Patrick:, Barnacle Boy!
,SpongeBob:, Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?
,Mermaid Man:, We don't have time for your childish games! We're responding to the distress signal that you sent!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. There appears to be a misunderstanding. You see, Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the monsters in the dark! We weren't trying to summon you.
,Mermaid Man:, Oh, fiddlesticks, SpongeBob. Do you know how hard it is in our... advanced age... to move? Don't shine a giant light in the sky unless there's a real emergency. ,[Cut to a super villain dressed like a white moth. He cackles, and flutters towards SpongeBob's house], And another thing: What the-!? ,[He sees the moth villain], Dear Neptune! It's the most dangerous and foreboding of all our arch nemeses—My mortal enemy whom I have searched 57 years for! At last, I have you! Come get some, fiend! ,[The Moth kicks Mermaid Man in the nose, and it throbs and swells], Come back here, rival! ,[He becomes weary and heroically naps on Patrick's rock],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, my! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here! ,[The Moth flies towards the lighthouse, and SpongeBob runs up it, too. The Moth cackles],
,The Moth:, Savory light, come to me!
,SpongeBob:, Say, let me help you! ,[He grabs the Moth and locks him inside of the lighthouse window with the light beacon. The Moth flutters around frantically and screams], Is that enough light for you? ,[SpongeBob laughs, then jumps down to the heroes and Patrick], Well, he's all taken care of.
,Mermaid Man:, Who?
,SpongeBob:, The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon! ,[At that moment, the Moth pushes up on the lighthouse and flies away, taking SpongeBob's house with him],
,The Moth:, See you in another 57 years! ,[He laughs wickedly as he flutters away],
,Mermaid Man:, No!
,Barnacle Boy:, I think it's time to go home.
,Mermaid Man:, Why are we here again?
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Bye, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
,Mermaid Man:, Who are those to hideous creatures of the dark?
,Barnacle Boy:, ,[Yawning], I'll tell you about it in the morning. Now, drive!
,[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy zoom off in the Invisible Boat Mobile],
,SpongeBob:, We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter.
,[both sobbing. Then, it is dawn and the sun rises],
,Patrick:, Huh? SpongeBob, there's a really big light! I'll go get it, buddy!
,[He runs up a beam of light to the sun],
,SpongeBob:, Pat! Come ba... ,[He yawns and falls asleep on Patrick's rock. Then, Patrick comes down from the sun, his butt ends up flaming],
,Patrick:, ,[screams], Too much light! Too much light! ,[screams],

"SpongeBob:, ,[turns off the alarm], Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary. ,[Gary pushes a button that sends SpongeBob jumping out of his bed, into the air. SpongeBob bounces off a chair, while sipping his cup of tea], Ahh... ,[toast pop out into the air, where SpongeBob eats them. Gary spits SpongeBob's pants into the air where SpongeBob lands on a target that Gary has painted], Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though. ,[Gary gives him an angry look. SpongeBob heads to the door], See you later. ,[opens the door where Patrick is standing there with a net in his hand],
,Patrick:, Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?
,SpongeBob:, Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.
,Patrick:, Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
,Patrick:, ,[starts to cry], Wait for you to get back.
,SpongeBob:, Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?
,Patrick:, Hey, that's a great idea!
,SpongeBob:, You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! ,[Patrick imagines a Kindergarten Class photo of him and SpongeBob smiling goofy with each other],
,Patrick:, Wow. ,[scene cuts to them at school],
,SpongeBob:, Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime. ,[shows Patrick Mrs. Puff's Boating School],
,Patrick:, ,[laughs], And no line.
,SpongeBob:, Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning. ,[runs up to the water fountain], And this is the Fountain Of Learning. ,[runs to the lockers], And these are the Lockers Of Learning.
,Patrick:, ,[runs up to some stairs], And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?
,SpongeBob:, No, they're just the stairs. ,[walks over to another set of stairs], These are the Stairs Of Learning.
,Patrick:, Where is everyone?
,SpongeBob:, I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.
,Patrick:, ,[He suddenly, hilariously wears a watch, and looks at it], 6:20? But I thought you said you were late.
,SpongeBob:, Late for being early.
,Patrick:, Hey! ,[looks at his watch], When did I start wearing a watch?
,SpongeBob:, ,[both walk into the classroom], And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.
,Patrick:, Ohh.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up to the chalkboard], And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
,Patrick:, Ohhh.
,SpongeBob:, ,[walks up to the Good Noodle Board], And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.,[looks at Patrick],
,Patrick:, Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!
,SpongeBob:, ,[points to each star], Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too. ,[adds Patrick's name], There you are.
,Patrick:, But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem! ,[high pitched], 74.
,Patrick:, Who said that? ,[runs over to an egg in a box], Was it him?
,SpongeBob:, I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.
,Patrick:, What does he teach us?
,SpongeBob:, The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat. ,[points the light bulb], This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.
,Patrick:, ,[turns light on and off], Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death!
,SpongeBob:, Patrick!
,Patrick:, ,[turns light on], Sorry. ,[SpongeBob moves his desk to the front of the teacher's desk],
,SpongeBob:, The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?
,Patrick:, ,[jumps into the chair], I'm learning!
,SpongeBob:, This is gonna be great! ,[both giggle. Scene cuts to class],
,Mrs. Puff:, Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?
,Patrick:, ,[confused], Who's the fat kid talking to?
,SpongeBob:, You, Patrick, she's the teacher.
,Patrick:, Oh.
,Mrs. Puff:, Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous. ,[Patrick gets up and looks at class],
,Patrick:, Uh...uh...
,Mrs. Puff:, We just want to know your name. ,[Patrick gets more nervous],
,Patrick:, Uh...uh...uh!...24! ,[class laughs hysterically],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[sarcastically], Oh, great, another genius...
,Patrick:, ,[sits back down], Why are they laughing?
,SpongeBob:, I guess it's just in the timing.
,Patrick:, Oh. ,[Patrick laughs after a brief pause],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[writes on the chalkboard], Today's first lesson will be on turning.
,Patrick:, 24. ,[both start to giggle, and Mrs. Puff pauses and continues writing],
,SpongeBob:, Hey, Patrick.
,Patrick:, What?
,SpongeBob:, I thought of something funnier than 24.
,Patrick:, Let me hear it.
,SpongeBob:, ,[stifled laugh], 25. ,[both try and fail to hold in their laughter. Patrick goes red in the face while SpongeBob bangs his fist on his desk],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[overhears], That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, Mrs. Puff.
,Mrs. Puff:, Now then, ""Turning""; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least... ,[Patrick places a paper on SpongeBob's desk],
,SpongeBob:, ,[looks at the drawing Patrick gave him of Mrs. Puff and gasps], Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
,Mrs. Puff:, What about the teacher? ,[SpongeBob screams then shivers and bites his lip in fear as Mrs. Puff sees Patrick's drawing of her. She now appears the same shape as Patrick's drawing to demonstrate the ""ugly"" drawing.], As if I really look like this! ,[puts it a drawer with a bunch of other bad drawings of her. Mrs. Puff returns back to her original shape and blames SpongeBob.], SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions. ,[Takes out a scraper. Scraper shines.],
,SpongeBob:, No...
,Mrs. Puff:, I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle. ,[walks over to the Good Noodle Board],
,SpongeBob:, ,[starting to cry], I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[about to remove the star], You'll get this star back when you earn it...
,SpongeBob:, ,[wailing], No! ,[As Mrs. Puff positions the scraper under the star and begins to peel it off, SpongeBob goes berserk, bouncing up and down in his seat and banging his head on his desk, constantly panting as he bangs his head.], ,[SpongeBob's head spins around on his body as Mrs. Puff slowly removes the star.], No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  ,[When the glue holding the star to the board stretches to the point of it snapping off the board, SpongeBob's eyes roll to the back of his head and he faints, sliding out of his seat onto the floor.],
,Patrick:, ,[raises his hand], Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!
,SpongeBob:, What, me? But why?
,Mrs. Puff:, Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Mad], Thanks a lot, Patrick.
,Patrick:, Sure thing, buddy. ,[SpongeBob walks to the back. His classmates are staring at him],
,SpongeBob:, Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. ,[Mrs. Puff's voice is receding as SpongeBob tries to listen from the back], It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? ,[reads the writing on the desk], 'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
,Patrick:, Psst, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[to himself], Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, over here.
,SpongeBob:, Whatever you do, don't look at him.
,Patrick:, Psst, SpongeBob. ,[grunts as he throws a piece of wadded-up paper at SpongeBob], Psst, SpongeBob. ,[throws a book at SpongeBob], SpongeBob? ,[spits a bunch of spitballs on SpongeBob's face], SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispers loudly], What?
,Patrick:, ,[meekly], Hi.
,SpongeBob:, ,[yells], HI?! ,[he growls, removing all the spitballs, then stops when he sees Mrs. Puff angry, covered in spitballs],
,Mrs. Puff:, Perhaps this would be a good time for recess. ,[scene cuts to SpongeBob at his locker. Patrick walks up to him],
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.
,SpongeBob:, ,[angrily slams his locker], There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
,Patrick:, ,[becomes angry], Who cares about a stupid star?
,SpongeBob:, Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!
,Patrick:, I'll deal with you after class!
,SpongeBob:, It is after class! ,[a group of students crowd around SpongeBob and Patrick chanting 'fight'],
,Patrick:, I don't see anyone fighting, do you?
,SpongeBob:, They're talking about us! We're fighting!
,Patrick:, Well, don't mind if I do! ,[both start to punch. The group of students start to quiet down as they notice SpongeBob and Patrick are punching, but missing at the same time],
,Student:, This is embarrassing. ,[everyone leaves as Mrs. Puff walks up],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[lifts SpongeBob and Patrick], What's going on here?! ,[looks at Patrick], Well?
,Patrick:, SpongeBob and I were fighting.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[gasps], Fighting? ,[puts them down], Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend ,[lights dim on Mrs. Puff and scary music plays], to detention!
,SpongeBob:, Detention!?
,Mrs. Puff:, May Neptune have mercy on your souls. ,[Mrs. Puff turns off the flashlight she was holding. Scene cuts to classroom where SpongeBob is sitting at the front and Patrick is sitting at the back],
,SpongeBob:, ,[sulking], In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. ,[angrily], It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. ,[turns to look at Patrick], I hate you, Patrick.
,Patrick:, I hate you more.
,SpongeBob:, I'd hate you no matter what.
,Patrick:, Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.
,SpongeBob:, ,[stares at Patrick for a few seconds, then narrows his eyes], I'd hate you even if that made sense.
,Patrick:, I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.
,SpongeBob:, I'd hate you, even if, uhh... ,[tries to think of something else to say], Um, I'd hate you... ,[points to Roger's tank], even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. ,[The camera quickly pans over to where SpongeBob is pointing. Suddenly, the light bulb flickers, and then burns out completely, with smoke rising out of the light bulb], Huh?
,[SpongeBob bites his lip and starts shivering. He glances over at Patrick. Patrick is sitting at his desk about to cry.],
,Patrick:, Ohh... ,[He starts to turn to look at SpongeBob, but when he sees him, he quickly looks away from him, crossing his arms.], Hmph.
,[SpongeBob watches Patrick, surprised, then does the same. But then he sees Roger's egg shivering in his tank and really starts to panic. We then see that it's snowing in Roger's tank. Snow is piled up around Roger, who is shivering under a pile of snow. Sleigh bells jingle in the background.],
,Patrick:, ,[teary-eyed again], Ohhhhh...! ,[cut back to Roger, who is frozen inside a giant ice cube, with wind blowing],
,[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to quietly sob. The camera closes-up on SpongeBob, then Patrick. Finally, unable to take it anymore, SpongeBob turns around in his desk.],
,SpongeBob:, Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!
,Patrick:, ,[talking fast], I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...
,SpongeBob:, I'm sorry your apology is so long!
,Patrick:, Me too! Let's save Roger! ,[they run to Roger],
,SpongeBob:, ,[takes Roger], I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet.
,Patrick:, ,[opens the door to the supply closet], Ahh. Light bulb! ,[there is a pile of light bulbs, but Patrick is looking at the one that is already plugged in at the top], But why does it have to be so far away? ,[begins to climb the pile of bulbs. SpongeBob tries warming up the egg by sitting on it, huffing and puffing on it, etc. while Patrick is still climbing the pile of light bulbs, wearing fancy clothing. Patrick finally reaches the top, blows a horn, removes his clothes, then runs down the pile with the light bulb], I'm coming, SpongeBob!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth. ,[runs into Patrick and both of their items are in the air], The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!
,Patrick:, Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! ,[both jump for the item that is closest to them and crash into the floor with an item in their hands. They put the light bulb and egg back where they were],
,SpongeBob:, We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[off-screen], Good job boys! ,[Mrs. Puff turns on a light from behind the chalkboard], I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.
,Patrick:, Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya SpongeBob. See ya Big Fat Meanie. ,[leaves the classroom],
,Roger:, ,[egg hatches], Hey what'd I miss?

"[scene starts out at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is looking at Plankton through a telescope],
,Plankton:, ,[waving a truce flag], I surrender!
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time. ,[walks up to Plankton], Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.
,Plankton:, There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?
,Mr. Krabs:, What is this? ,[takes the flag and looks at it for any secret material], Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.
,Plankton:, Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!
,Mr. Krabs:, But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?
,Plankton:, Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it. ,[sighs], Let me show you something. ,[scene cuts to them walking into the Chum Bucket, which is full of spider webs], Look at this place!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[runs into a spider web and screams], Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?
,Plankton:, What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?
,Mr. Krabs:, Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.
,Plankton:, Well, there he is. ,[points to skeleton animal on the table], That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into... ,[pulls out a box of knickknacks], this!
,Mr. Krabs:, You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?
,Plankton:, No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?
,Plankton:, I'm serious, Krabs. Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.
,Mr. Krabs:, All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.
,Plankton:, Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career. ,[hums as Mr. Krabs walks away],
,SpongeBob:, What's going on Mr. Krabs?
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.
,SpongeBob:, Whatever you say, cap'n. ,[peels eyes],
,Mr. Krabs:, Now that's an employee who follows orders. ,[loud jack hammering is heard], What in blazes is that noise? ,[Plankton reveals the new name of his business: ""Chumporium""],
,Plankton:, Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.
,SpongeBob:, ,[holding a snow globe], Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[takes the snow globe], Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere. ,[tries to open it],
,SpongeBob:, Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.
,Mr. Krabs:, Eh, we'll see about that. ,[walks to a door], I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past. ,[throws snow globe into a room full of Plankton's past schemes, then locks the door], Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.
,SpongeBob:, That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Right away, sir.
,Mr. Krabs:, Let's party! ,[music plays and SpongeBob is seen DJ-ing], Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
,Squidward:, This is idiotic.
,Mr. Krabs:, Dance or you're fired.
,Squidward:, You got it, Mr. Krabs. ,[dances],
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[opens front door], How do you like them apples, you little... ,[record scratching],
,Plankton:, ,[carrying a toy seal behind him], Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.
,Mr. Krabs:, Wait a minute. ,[sneaks over to the Chumporium], What the...? ,[sees a bunch of novelty items inside through the window], Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps? ,[gasps], Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war. ,[scene cuts to Mr Krabs walking into the Chumporium. Plankton is dusting off his knickknacks],
,Plankton:, Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe. ,[laughs],
,Mr. Krabs:, Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.
,Plankton:, Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed. ,[laughs then sighs], Those were the days, huh Eugene?
,Mr. Krabs:, Grr...
,Plankton:, But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.
,Mr. Krabs:, Bubkes.
,Plankton:, Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.
,Mr. Krabs:, Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula. ,[takes out the formula], You know you want it.
,Plankton:, Thanks, but no.
,Mr. Krabs:, A-ha, I knew it. ,[chuckles], It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?
,Plankton:, Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.
,Mr. Krabs:, Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front... ,[throws one of the shelves down. Plankton gasps], ...a sham, a snow job... ,[throwing snow globes onto the ground and breaking them], ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! ,[shatters a row of lava lamps with a big stick], See?! Who's the one with the problem?!
,Plankton:, Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. [chuckles]
,Plankton:, ,[very angry, screaming], Get out!
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[gasps], Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move. ,[drops the formula], Oops.
,Plankton:, What's this? ,[groans], Hey, Krabs!
,Mr. Krabs:, I knew you'd come back.
,Plankton:, You forgot something. ,[throws the formula back at Mr. Krabs], Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy. ,[walks off],
,Mr. Krabs:, I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton! ,[cries loudly, he runs across the road and falls down crying some more. Scene cuts to night. Phone rings in the Chumporium as Plankton is taking a shower],
,Plankton:, Coming, coming. ,[answers], Yo.
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, Plankton?
,Plankton:, Eugene?
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, hey.
,Plankton:, Hey.
,Mr. Krabs:, Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?
,Plankton:, Yes. I'm still here.
,Mr. Krabs:, Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?
,Plankton:, Sure. ,[scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab. Mr Krabs and Plankton are sitting at a table with sodas],
,Mr. Krabs:, Glad you could make it, buddy.
,Plankton:, So, what's this about, Krabs? ,[sips his soda],
,Mr. Krabs:, I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.
,Plankton:, Yes. Yes, I would like that very much. ,[scene cuts to Mr Krabs and Plankton walking along the pier then playing pool], I guess I won. ,[both laugh before Plankton gets hit by a ball. Scene cuts to both in a hot air balloon, on a slide, eating cotton candy, then at a trust booth],
,Mr. Krabs:, Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.
,Plankton:, Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you. ,[chuckles. Mr. Krabs falls back and Plankton strains to keep him up. Scene cuts to both sitting on the edge of the pier],
,Mr. Krabs:, That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.
,Plankton:, Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.
,Mr. Krabs:, And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.
,Plankton:, Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.
,Mr. Krabs:, No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.
,Plankton:, I can't believe you would even think...
,Mr. Krabs:, Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.
,Plankton:, You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.
,Mr. Krabs:, Come on, take it.
,Plankton:, You sure? ,[Mr. Krabs nods], Life is good, Krabs.
,Mr. Krabs:, Sure is, buddy. Sure is. ,[screen fades to black. Plankton appears],
,Plankton:, Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo! ,[laughs. Runs into his Chumporium], I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician. ,[laughs. Opens up the formula to read ""GOTCHA! Love, Krabs"". Lights turn on],
,Mr. Krabs:, I never gave you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade. ,[laughs and walks out. Plankton screams with frustrated anger],

,Squidward:, Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?
,SpongeBob:, We were just posting Patrick's new ""For Rent"" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see? ,[the sign is shown],
,Squidward:, For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
,Patrick:, Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean?
,Squidward:, Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?
,Patrick:, First come, first, serve.
,Squidward:, Oh great, now another idiot can move in.
,SpongeBob:, Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
,Squidward:, Oh I would love to. Just let me check my planner. ,[takes out his planner and looks in it],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, thanks!
,Squidward:, Oh no, I'm sorry I can't.
,SpongeBob:, Aww, why not?
,Squidward:, It's because I was planning to do ""No such thing""! See?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.
,Patrick:, Yeah, thanks. ,[Bubble transition],
,Squidward:, With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and... ,[everything shakes], ...quiet. ,[walks outside], Now what are those two boobs up to? I thought you guys were... ,[SpongeBob and Patrick aren't there], Hmmm. I wonder who was making all that noise.
,Howard:, Hello. My name is Howard.
,Squidward:, Hello, Howard.
,Howard:, I noticed this ""For Rent"" sign. Is this yard still for rent?
,Squidward:, Sorry, you're too late.
,Howard:, Hmmm. Howard is disappointed.
,Squidward:, Aren't we all?
,Howard:, I thought this would be the one place to pursue my passions...
,Squidward:, ,[peeks out door], Passions?
,Howard:, ...play the bassoon...
,Squidward:, The bassoon?
,Howard:, ...and enjoy a nice cup of tea in my front yard.
,Squidward:, ,[speaks gibberish], I can't believe what I am hearing. ,[sighs], Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert! ,[sighs again],
,Howard:, ,[leaving], Farewell. I new this was too good to be true.
,Squidward:, ,[stops him], Wait! Don't go!' '[panting], I was...just kidding!,
,Howard:, Well, in that case, I should move in right away! ,[invites Squidward], Make yourself at home.
,Squidward:, Wow, his designs are impeccable! ,[to Howard], Yes, I do feel ""at home"".
,Howard:, I would like to propose a toast—to a new neighbor.
,Squidward:, To a new neighbor! ,[they both drink tea],
,Howard:, While we're on the topic, what are the other neighbors like?
,Squidward:, ,[nervous], Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors.
,Howard:, That's neat. I'm the neighbor that likes all kinds of neighbors!
,Squidward:, Well, that's nice!
,Howard:, Well, as long they aren't jellyfishers. ,[Squidward nearly chokes on his tea], I can't STAND anyone who jellyfishes. But, luckily, they're not the worst kind of neighbor.
,Squidward:, Well, that's nice.
,Howard:, That would be the bubble blowers. ,[Squid spits out his tea], Between the jellyfishers and the bubble blowers, I just couldn't stand to stay in my old neighborhood anymore.
,Squidward:, Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like! ,[Squid looks out the window. SpongeBob and Patrick return from jellyfishing and notice the trailer],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, look! There's a mobile home parked in front of my house!
,SpongeBob:, Do you know what that means?
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, All hail the landlord! [laughter]
,Patrick:, SpongeBob, what do you say we go knock on the door and meet the new neighbor?
,SpongeBob:, Great idea.
,Squidward:, Oh no!
,Howard:, What's going on? Is someone out there?
,Squidward:, ,[closes certains], Nope, No! There's nobody at all for miles around!
,Howard:, Are you sure? I thought I heard voices.
,Squidward:, Nope, there weren't any voices.
,Howard:, Perhaps it's the other neighbors coming to meet me. We'd better check.
,Squidward:, No! I can't let you do that!
,Howard:, ,[chuckles], Well, of course you can. They're your neighbors, too.
,Squidward:, No! You REALLY don't wanna go out there, trust me! ,[jerks on Howard's arm harder and harder],
,Howard:, You're hurting my arm!
,Squidward:, ,[lets go], Oh, sorry. I was just wondering if we could...
,Howard:, Could, what?
,Squidward:, Um, form a little duet together. Just you and me. Just the two of us. Together. You know. Me on clarinet and you on bassoon.
,Howard:, Why, that's a splendid idea. I'll get some sheet music.
,Patrick:, Hey, Did you see the way those curtains jerked shut?
,SpongeBob:, Yeah. Our new neighbor must be really shy.
,Patrick:, Maybe we could just came back and meet him later.
,SpongeBob:, Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend to—like this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!
,Squidward:, Phew! That was close.
,Howard:, And a one and a two... ,[they both olay on their instruments],
,Squidward:, ,[thinking], Squiddy, this is absolutely the best day of your life! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are heard laughing],
,Howard:, That's funny, I thought I just had this thing tuned.
,Squidward:, Uh, that's me! I think this reed needs replacing. Excuse me for a moment! ,[runs builds a fence around Howard's house], There! Now, where were we?
,Patrick:, Look! Our new neighbor must be even shyer than we thought!

,Squidward:, ,[nervously], Why, Howard, I would never hide anything from you!
,Howard:, Stand aside! ,[SpongeBob and Patrick are shown jellyfishing and blowing bubbles], REPULSIVE! Somebody's got to stop these bubble blowing jellyfishers!
,Squidward:, ,[crying], WAIT! Please, Howard, don't go! You're the rain of sunshine I've had in years!
,Howard:, I'm sorry. It's too late, Mr. Tentacles!
,Squidward:, Oh, Neptune, nooooo!
,Howard:, ,[to SpongeBob and Patrick], You there! ,[pops a bubble], Hey! That was actually kind of fun! Maybe now's the time I stopped being so stuffy and loosened up for a change! ,[joins in on the fun],
,Squidward:, I know I can handle two dunderheads, but I draw the line at three! ,[knocks out the brick and Howard's trailer rolls away],
,Howard:, My house! ,[runs after it and jumps off the cliff], I knew it was too good to be true!
,Squidward:, ,[sadly as he holds a piece of the broken sign], Well, I almost had a decent neighbor.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squidward. We can cheer you up. ,[blows a bubble],
,Patrick:, Go on. Pop it!
,Squidward:, Well, Squiddy, what have I got to lose? ,[bubble floats away], Hey, come back here you bubble! ,[bubble floats over the same cliff and Squidward jumps off of it], JELLYFISHING BUBBLE BLOWERS!

,Frankie:, Yeah, thanks... ,[gasps], Oh, real funny, buddy. Two socks and a pair of tighty whities.
,Squidward:, Socks and-- ,[gasps. socks and underwear are in the register instead of money], What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?
,SpongeBob:, Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection. ,[blocks of snowflakes are in the freezer], So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar.
,Squidward:, What?
,Mr. Krabs:, ,[laughs], Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery.
,SpongeBob:, Do you want to know where the mustard is? ,[Gary is covered in mustard],
,Squidward:, Ah! Eww. ,[cut to later], Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor.
,SpongeBob:, ,[sings], Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song.
,Mr. Krabs:, SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces. ,[Harold sees underwear and stops chewing],
,SpongeBob:, Well, they don't see to mind. ,[Harold takes down a pair of underwear and uses it as a napkin],
,Mr. Krabs:, Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely.
,SpongeBob:, ,[chuckles], Aye aye, captain.
,Mr. Krabs:, Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement—meaning yours—to interfere with said money spending. ,[tries opening his office door but can't], What the barnacles? ,[opens the door slightly to see all of SpongeBob's stuff in his office], SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?
,SpongeBob:, It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen. ,[squeezes inside the office], So I moved in here.
,Mr. Krabs:, You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day.
,SpongeBob:, But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!

You're moving out. ,[SpongeBob is shaving in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Squidward is about to relax in his lawn chair when a moving truck drives up],
,Squidward:, What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums! ,[plays the drums frantically.],

,Hot Dog Vendor:, ,[scoffs at Neptune], Uh, he did. ,[points to SpongeBob],
,King Neptune:, ,[everyone laughs], It is even funnier a second time! ,[destroys the hot dog stand with his fist], You there, crustacean!
,Larry:, Who, me?
,King Neptune:, You have the physique of Atlas!
,Larry:, ,[laughs], Thanks, I work out.
,King Neptune:, ,[laughs], Make poses with me!
,Larry:, Okay!
,Larry and King Neptune:, ,[show off their muscles], Body slam! ,[body slams each other],
,King Neptune:, You pulled the spatula from the grease!
,Larry:, Nope, that was SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob smiles],
,King Neptune:, This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook? ,[everyone runs except Patrick], Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate! ,[Patrick points to SpongeBob], What? Am I expected to believe ,this, creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof? ,[Patrick shows the photo he took of SpongeBob holding the spatula], Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.
,SpongeBob:, Like?
,King Neptune:, The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.
,SpongeBob:, Actually, I've got two. ,[shows two left hands],
,King Neptune:, ,[snaps fingers], Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear. ,[SpongeBob shows his red underwear], No, blue. ,[SpongeBob shows his blue underwear], Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains... ,[SpongeBob takes out his wallet], His big toes are... ,[SpongeBob gets ready to show something about his foot], Uhh, he has six...
,Patrick:, ,[contemptuously mocks Neptune], He is the new royal fry cook and you...
,King Neptune:, ,[shouting], Silence! ,[Patrick gets zapped],
,Patrick:, Is it hot in here or what? ,[falls over],
,SpongeBob:, ,[gasp], Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!
,King Neptune:, ,[grabs SpongeBob], So, little one, you think you have what it takes to become my royal fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!
,Patrick:, ,[faint, down below], ,[mocks Neptune again], Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any... ,[Patrick gets zapped again], Ouch.
,King Neptune:, Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
,Patrick:,  ,[mocks Neptune again], Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob? ,[Patrick gets zapped again],
,King Neptune:, Three challenges!
,Patrick:, Three? ,[laughs contemptuously], ,[mocks Neptune with sarcasm], Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges! ,[Patrick gets zapped again],
,King Neptune:, Enough! ,[Patrick gets zapped into a dust pile],
,Patrick:, He'll settle for one.
,King Neptune:, There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
,SpongeBob:, I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
,King Neptune:, Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him. ,[Patrick gets zapped to normal],
,Patrick:, SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! ,[turns around as we see that his face is now on the bottom of his body above his legs], SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
,SpongeBob:, How you feeling?
,Patrick:, Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
,King Neptune:, And now, see the fate that may lie ahead. ,[summons the clouds], For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great. ,[opens the clouds], Behold! ,[shows Tom Kenny taking a shower and he screams; Neptune quickly closes the portal and blushes], Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold! ,[opens the clouds again and shows the city of Atlantis], My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!
,Patrick:, Hey, that sounds pretty good.
,King Neptune:, But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?
,SpongeBob:, I'm ready.
,King Neptune:, Very well then. To the Poseidome! ,[At the Poseidome],
,Mr. Krabs:, Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off! ,[Everyone cheers], All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.,[King Neptune and SpongeBob shake hands. SpongeBob's arm disintegrates],
,SpongeBob:, ,[regrows his hand], May the best man win.
,Mr. Krabs:, Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking! ,[talking to SpongeBob], Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you. ,[Mr. Krabs has a lot of money in his hands], Put it all on Neptune!
,SpongeBob:, I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
,Patrick:, Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: ""Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds."" Well, just look at me now. ,[bell dings], Go get 'em, tiger! ,[King Neptune starts making his Krabby Patties and so does SpongeBob.],
,[King Neptune makes his very quickly with help from sea creatures and his magic. SpongeBob takes his time going through each important step to make sure his patty comes out right. King Neptune summons large amounts of wheat from the ground and zaps them into buns.],
,[King Neptune summons the vegetables, and summons the swordfish to slice them all. SpongeBob makes sure a tomato is perfectly aligned. He carefully slices the tomato with the golden spatula.],
,[King Neptune zaps the patties, while SpongeBob rubs sticks to create a fire. King Neptune uses magic to flip hundreds of patties. SpongeBob patiently waits for the patty to cook above the campfire.],
,[King Neptune uses magic to assemble the hundreds of burgers that appear like Krabby Patties. King Neptune laughs while the burgers rain down. SpongeBob puts ketchup on two pickles to apply faces on them. He applies a cheese ""blanket,"" kisses a pickle.],
,SpongeBob:, ,[reading a bedtime story to the pickles], Once upon a time...
,[King Neptune still laughs, while the burgers assemble in a square-based pyramid. SpongeBob puts the top bun on his one Krabby Patty.],
,SpongeBob:, Perfect!
,[In the end, the score is King Neptune: 1000 and SpongeBob: 1],
,King Neptune:, I win! ,[everyone cheers but SpongeBob], Loser! ,[Chuckles], Free patties for everyone! ,[everyone chews a bite out of the patties that King Neptune made and they spit it out immediately], Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious! ,[sniffs one], Ooh.
,Audience:, ,[Everyone complains different complaints that King Neptune needs to try one of his burgers], You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!
,King Neptune:, ,[throws his burger out], Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better? ,[King Neptune grabs a patty from SpongeBob], Give me that! ,[King Neptune eats it and begins to like it], Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time! ,[King Neptune spits it out and eats it again; the crowd groans in disgust.],
,SpongeBob:, So, uhh, what do you think?
,King Neptune:, Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win. ,[everyone cheers],
,SpongeBob & Patrick:, Yeah! ,[both dancing], We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis! ,[King Neptune laughs],
,SpongeBob:, What's so funny?
,King Neptune:, You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?
,SpongeBob:, You mean, Patrick can't come?
,King Neptune:, ,[laughs], No, of course not.
,SpongeBob:, And my friends?
,King Neptune:, Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.
,Patrick:, ,[crying and wiping his tears with a tissue], It was nice knowing you, buddy!
,SpongeBob:, ,[Mr Krabs cries], I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.
,Mr. Krabs:, I lost me bet!
,King Neptune:, Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart... ,[a two-seater bike appears], to Atlantis!,[rings bell],
,SpongeBob:, I... I... ,[cries], I don't wanna go!
,King Neptune:, It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it! ,[King Neptune zaps SpongeBob and he becomes a muscular god. But being the same size, he looks a little strange], Maybe we do have a problem.
,SpongeBob:, ,[in a booming voice], Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! ,[Patrick walks in the Krusty Krab still looking the same when King Neptune changed him back to normal but with his face on the bottom],
,Patrick:, Good morning, Krusty Krew.
,SpongeBob:, Hi, Patrick. What'll you have? ,[Patrick drools stupidly then SpongeBob hears King Neptune shout], Can you excuse me?
,King Neptune:, The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove! ,[uses his powers to zap the stove], Haha!
,SpongeBob:, What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
,King Neptune:, ,[Sighs. Embarrassedly puts arms behind his back.], Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic. ,[SpongeBob smiles],

"[Episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Mrs. Puff is teaching her students],
,Mrs. Puff:, Remember, class, there's only one way to park a boat: the safe way. You now see the importance of proper steering and a properly calibrated anchor... ,[SpongeBob writes it down and puts the paper inside his head], ...which brings us to the subject of rudder maintenance. ,[bell rings. Everyone runs outside except SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Barnacles! Just as we were getting to the nitty-gritty!
,Mrs. Puff:, Wait a minute, class! ,[everyone stops and bumps into each other then Jimmy Gus hits the back of the line the hardest and the first fish in line falls out the door], Remember, we will not be here tomorrow. We will be going on a field trip to the Boating Museum. Now run along, kids. ,[they all run out and Mrs. Puff goes to her desk],
,SpongeBob:, Wow, the Boating Museum! Maybe tomorrow if I can impress Mrs. Puff with an extensive knowledge of boating history, she'll give me a boating license on the spot! ,[starts laughing and ""drives"" his chair out the door and makes boating noises], See you tomorrow, Mrs. P.! ,[starts laughing again],
,Mrs. Puff:, Neptune, give me strength!
,[Setting goes to SpongeBob at his house at night in his library.],
,SpongeBob:, Let's see. Ah, there she is. Whoa! ,[finds his boating history book and falls on the ground with the book and Gary meows], What is this, Gary? Why, it's the complete history of all boating ever and I'm going to memorize it tonight for the big field trip tomorrow. ,[Gary meows again], I'm perfectly capable of reading 7,400 pages and still getting my required eight hours of sleep before the bus picks me up at promptly at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get started. ,[Gary moves away], All right, let's see what this little pamphlet is all about. ,[starts reading], ""Chapter 1: In the beginning, Neptune created the sail.""
,Narrator:, 7:59 a.m.
,SpongeBob:, ""...but such tragedies will be avoided with the flying boat of the future. The end."" ,[looks really exhausted from reading 7,400 pages], Time for a little shuteye before... ,[closes his eyes then his alarm rings. He opens them], Oh, Mrs. Puff, can't this wait till tomorrow? ,[closes his eyes again then also opens them], Hang on a minute, it is tomorrow! ,[he runs out his door and sees the bus and runs for it], Hey, wait! Hey! Mrs. Puff! Please stop the bus! ,[he sees Mrs. Puff through the window and knocks],
,Bus Driver:, What was that?
,Mrs. Puff:, Nothing, uhh, just keep driving. ,[SpongeBob knocks on the window again], Step on it!
,[The bus driver puts the pedal to metal.],
,SpongeBob:, Wait!
,Mrs. Puff:, Phew. ,[SpongeBob's face is on the window, Mrs. Puff screams and he gets inside],
,SpongeBob:, No worries, I made it.
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, you look terrible.
,[SpongeBob’s face looks exhausting],
,SpongeBob:, I assure you, I am well rested and ready to learn. Who knows, Mrs. Puff? Before the day is out you may have learned something yourself. ,[Mrs. Puff smells SpongeBob's odor, sprays ""Shower in a Can"" on him and he smells better], Hey, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, I made this for you.
,Mrs. Puff:, Made what?
,SpongeBob:, ,[holds out a model of a tiny boat], This, the H.M.S. Pinafore, at 1 to 8,427 scale of course.
,Mrs. Puff:, Thank you, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Do you know how many rowers it takes to propel a trireme?
,Mrs. Puff:, Well, that would be...
,SpongeBob:, Do you know which boat is fastest on record?
,Mrs. Puff:, Wasn't that the...
,SpongeBob:, Did you know in the future that all boats will be powered by dolphin manure? ,[screen zooms in to SpongeBob], Did you know that the H.M.S. Bluetoes was originally a racing boat before it became the royal family's private yacht? Do you know what scuttling is? What's bigger, a flotilla or a fleet? Did you know... ,[time passes], Ever been on a... ,[the bus stops at the museum and SpongeBob flies to the windshield],
,Bus Driver:, We're here. ,[SpongeBob goes out the door and notices the Boating Museum],
,Mrs. Puff:, Welcome, class, to the Boating Museum. This enormous vessel was once the largest in all the seas, but now that has been converted into a museum, it no longer moves.
,SpongeBob:, Actually, it gets taken to port once a year for maintenance.
,Mrs. Puff:, If you don't mind, SpongeBob, I'll be doing the teaching today.
,SpongeBob:, No problemo, Mrs. P. ,[Mrs. Puff and the rest enter the museum with a room with many boats],}
,Mrs. Puff:, Here it is, class. The most extensive collection of seafaring history ever assembled, from giant naval vessels to more modest craft like this clamming boat.
,SpongeBob:, I'd say this baby can hold up to... ten clam fishers.
,Mrs. Puff:, Uh, sure, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, Why, I bet they reel in up to 50 clams a day.
,Mrs. Puff:, Moving along. ,[they go to a big boat], Over here we have the Sandy Nub. It was a cargo ship used to bring back exotic spices from faraway lands.
,SpongeBob:, ,[laughs], With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws, ,[snaps finger], it'll get your spices where they need to go.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[in a mad voice], Thank you again, SpongeBob.
,SpongeBob:, It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license.
,[Setting goes to another big boat.],
,Mrs. Puff:, This, class, is the Lady Scallion.
,SpongeBob:, ...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's ,[makes a P.U. sign], odor strongly resembled. ,[the kids start taking pictures of him], For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people ,[Mrs. Puff expresses a furious face],who already lived there. ,[She growls. SpongeBob taps on Mrs. Puff], You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff?
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[angry voice], Oh, you're going to get it all right.
,SpongeBob:, ,[squeals], I knew it!
,[They go to more places while SpongeBob informs the class and Mrs. Puff doesn't get a chance. They go to a boat and Mrs. Puff tells them about it, but is interrupted by SpongeBob, who is looking through binoculars at the top. The kids cheer, Mrs. Puff makes an angry face. After the montage, they then walk out of the museum.],
,Mrs. Puff:, Okay, this is the end of the tour. Anything to add, SpongeBob? ,[she doesn't see him], SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[he turns his chair around inside the museum still], Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard. ,[gasps], And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there. ,[points at the Air Conditioner button], A/C, hmmm...That's short for ""automatic conditionata"", and that's fancy ,fancy, talk for ""Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!"" ,[Presses A/C button, the fast air moves towards SpongeBob, who pushes the vent to the left], Whew. ,[The fast air turns the boat on and an alarm occurs and gears and engines move then the boat moves], Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen. ,[Glass ticks and SpongeBob looks behind],
,Mrs. Puff:, That's not a projection screen! ,[Runs towards SpongeBob and sits on his lap], SpongeBob, stop it right now!
,SpongeBob:, Yes, ma’am. ,[turns the turbo speed on then boat goes faster],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, sweet Poseidon. Move aside. ,[pushes SpongeBob away], I gotta stop this ship before it plows into Bikini Bottom! Uh, uh, let's see. The first thing to turn off is the... Uh, oh, dear Neptune! I've never driven anything this advanced before. ,[pulls SpongeBob back], SpongeBob, I hope you know what you were talking about, because it's up to you now.
,SpongeBob:, Okay. ,[tries the steering wheel],
,Mrs. Puff:, We don't have much time. In a few minutes, we'll be flattening millions of innocent lives!
,SpongeBob:, Innocent lives?!
,Mrs. Puff:, And you're the only one that can save them.
,SpongeBob:, The only one...that can...save...them?!
,Mrs. Puff:, Yes! And what I want you to do ,[SpongeBob's face turns into a frown], is ummm, tighten the gurneys, then survey the poop deck, and...
,SpongeBob:, Stop! I know what to do. ,[pulls out a pirate hat and puts it onto his head], I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches. ,[all doors and windows were shut], Next, lower anchor. ,[the anchor lowers down, but gets stuck on railings], Oh no! ,[as screen shakes], The anchor is stuck. I’m going to free it manually. I'll be right back. ,[jumps out of the control center, flies towards the anchor and pulls the anchor with a horse gallop sound and when anchor is free, he swings back and cuts to the control center], Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh. ,[laughs like a pirate but harsher],
,Mrs. Puff:, Oh, my gravy. He even knows the hearty laugh! He ,has, been doing his homework!
,SpongeBob:, ,[still laughs], And finally, the coup de grace. The only way to park the largest ship ever built, ,[Zooms to SpongeBob's face], is to perform the Reverse 7/20 Tail Spin.
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[gasps], But that's never been attempted before.
,SpongeBob:, You're right, it hasn't. ,[says sentence with a surprise], Not until now! ,[Ship spins and does a backflip and spins again then returns to it's position.] [Cuts to a scene where Bikini Bottom is shown in the ship's windshield and stops with a tiny crash on an apartment and both SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff sighs],
,Mrs. Puff:, SpongeBob, I don't know how, ,[Mrs. Puff's face turns into a smile], but you did it. You saved us all. Let's get off this thing. ,[Cut into a scene where they get off the ship], And the way you pulled the anchor out, genius! I never thought I'd say this, but here's your driver's license. ,[SpongeBob screams and slowly grabs the license],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, boy! At long last!
,Tugboat driver:, What are you doing here? ,[SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff look], No one should be on board while I’m tugging the museum into port.
,Mrs. Puff:, You mean, he's not driving this thing at all?
,Tugboat driver:, Heck, no! ,[Mrs. Puff rips the license, SpongeBob saddens and pulls off the hat, looking at it], ,[To SpongeBob], Now, don't get so down, kid! Look, for your false bravery, I’m giving your honorary Sea Legs, okay? Come on, lemme buy you some ice cream. ,[The boat alarms softly which cuts to the scene where the headlights are on],
,SpongeBob:, Oh gosh. [chuckles] Headlights are on! ,[Runs back into the ship],
,Mrs. Puff & Tugboat driver:, DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING, YOU TWIT! ,[SpongeBob gets back on the boat],
,Tugboat driver:, Run! ,[The ship flips sideways],
,Mrs. Puff:, ,[Mrs. Puff inflates then turn to SpongeBob who pops up beside her], Good thing you studied. ,[Episode ends],

"Squidward:, Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. ,[blows kiss], Congratulations, chef! ,[gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops],
,SpongeBob Bubble:, Hi, Patrick.
,[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops],
,Patrick Bubble:, Hi, SpongeBob.
,[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, blows a bubble of his own from the liquid of his soufflé with a fork. SpongeBob whispers into another bubble],
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispering into bubble], Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
,[the bubble floats over but is kicked when Squidward's bubble approaches, popping SpongeBob's bubble. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops],
,Squidward Bubble:, ,[mimicking SpongeBob], Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
,[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob],
,Patrick Bubble:, Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, ,[whispering into the bubble], Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. ,[the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob],
,Patrick Bubble:, Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. ,[another bubble comes over and pops], Yellow is ugly! ,[two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[talks into the bubble, puzzled], Patrick, what are you talking about?
,[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops],
,Squidward Bubble:, ,[mimicking Patrick], SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. ,[SpongeBob gasps], You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
,[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob],
,Squidward Bubble:, ,[mimicking Patrick], If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
,[Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick],
,Squidward Bubble:, ,[mimicking SpongeBob], Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
,Patrick:, ,[stands up and yells at SpongeBob], Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
,SpongeBob:, ,[stands up and yells at Patrick], Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
,Patrick:, Right, you're a turkey!
,SpongeBob:, What's that? ,[Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé],
,Patrick:, It's what you are!
,[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.],
,SpongeBob:, Well, you're a bigger one!
,Patrick:, Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
,SpongeBob:, What?
,Patrick:, You are!
,SpongeBob:, Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! ,[he goes inside through the back door and turns around], Aww, tartar sauce! ,[shuts door],
,[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ],
,Squidward:, ,[Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.], ,[Continues laughing. Moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it. Chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters ""K"" and ""O"" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appears. Squidward passes out and drools],
,Patrick:, Wow, Squidward, you're choking! ,[runs over to Squidward], Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. ,[he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it], I win!
,Squidward:, Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
,Patrick:, I did?
,Squidward:, Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! ,[shakes Patrick's hands],
,Patrick:, Friend? ,[holds Squidward], Friend...
,Squidward:, ,[uneasily], Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... ,[steps back], just friends. ,[they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare],
,Patrick:, So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? ,[walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head],
,Squidward:, Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
,Patrick:, Clarinet? I love music!
,[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house],
,SpongeBob:, Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? ,[Gary is sleeping inside his shell], Gary? ,[knocks on his shell],
,[cut to Squidward's],
,Squidward:, Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
,Patrick:, ,[sitting on a bench while clapping], Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! ,[Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! ,[he holds up three fingers], Uhh... ,[he draws faces on each finger with a broken smile], The gang's all here... ,[he looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears], Ohhh!

,Squidward:, SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
,SpongeBob:, ,[running], Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
,Squidward:, No, no, no, get away from me!
,SpongeBob:, Hang on! I'll save you! ,[rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath],
,Squidward:, ,[tries to get to his door], No, no! Get away from me! No, no!

,SpongeBob:, ,Friend,...
,Squidward:, N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
,SpongeBob:, Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. ,[Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head], So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
,Squidward:, You play?
,SpongeBob:, Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! ,[he takes one from the wall], Give me an A, buddy! ,[Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings], Squidward is my best friend in the world. ,[grates strings with bow], Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
,[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee],

,Patrick:, ,[pops in through the window], Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. ,[SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face], Oh!

,Squidward:, Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! ,[he kicks SpongeBob out],
,SpongeBob:, ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
,Squidward:, Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. ,[opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub],
,Patrick:, Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. ,[shows him a brush and soap],
,Squidward:, Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! ,[SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window],
,SpongeBob:, What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? ,[notices Patrick in the bath-tub], Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... ,[shown bath toys], ...rubber bath toys!
,Patrick:, ,[simultaneously], Oh, yeah?! Well, he was ,my, friend first!
,SpongeBob:, ,[simultaneously], You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
,Squidward:, ,[screams], This can't be happening to me! ,[He runs away. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone],

,Patrick:, Where are ya, ol' buddy?

,Patrick:, Me neither! This was a setup!
,Squidward:, I thought you two were my best friends.
,SpongeBob and Patrick:, I ,am, your best friend!
,Squidward:, ,[takes out a bottle of soda], Well, how about some soda, guys? ,[SpongeBob shows him his glass],
,SpongeBob:, Yes, please! ,[Squidward gives him some soda], Thanks, friend. ,[flicks Squidward's nose], ,[drinks],
,Patrick:, How about some for your best friend? ,[SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick],
,SpongeBob:, Thanks, best friend! ,[drinks],
,Patrick:, Can I have some now, buddy?
,SpongeBob:, Wait, I need some more! ,[pours SpongeBob another glass],
,Patrick:, I still didn't get any! ,[SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda],

,Squidward:, Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. ,[walks away], Why don't you just stay here and chat? ,[closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard], I should just walk away right now. ,[opens door to find his house destroyed], What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? ,[pieces around the door break],
,SpongeBob:, Guess what, Squidward? ,[both hug],
,Patrick:, Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
,Squidward:, Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
,SpongeBob:, Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
,Squidward:, No! Out! ,[both walk out],
,SpongeBob:, Psst, I think he's jealous.
,Patrick:, How pathetic. ,[Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back],
,Squidward:, Ohhhhh, my back.

"Patrick:, ,[walking], So why are we going to Sandy's house?
,SpongeBob:, To see her vacation slides for the hu.. ,[gets smacked in face by door], Ow!
,ZDS Agent:, ,[Walking out the door with his partner and the slides], We got the slides, sir.
,Patrick:, Who?...What?...Why?
,[The both get dragged in by Sandy],
,Sandy:, ,[Taking SpongeBob and Patrick], Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think... ,[She pulls a tree trunk lever to activate a secret hideout], You see, ,[puts the two on two chairs. She goes to a copy of the vacation slides], Someone already made six copies.
,[SpongeBob raises his hand],
,Sandy:, Yes, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Who is this someone? Do we know him?
,Sandy:, By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob. ,[Patrick raises his hand], Yes, Patrick?
,Patrick:, Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.
,[SpongeBob raises his hand again],
,Sandy:, ,[tying up SpongeBob and Patrick with rope], Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay? ,[they nod in agreement], Good. ,[shows the first slide], The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation. ,[switches to the next slide], And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute. ,[shows the next slide], And this... ,[dreadfully] This, is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit. 
,[transition to SpongeBob visiting Sandy],
,SpongeBob:, ,[walking to Sandy's house], ♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy ,[spinning], I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪ ,[rings the doorbell; suddenly, an extreme humming noise vibrates the ocean floor], Sandy...! ,[a rocket emerges from beneath the ground], Whoa!
,Sandy:, What do you think of my moon wagon?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?
,Sandy:, Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a ""coincidence."" I'm getting ready for my vacation!
,SpongeBob:, Where are you going?
,Sandy:, The moon! ,[SpongeBob gasps],
,SpongeBob:, You're going on a moon trip?!
,Sandy:, Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me…
,SpongeBob:, I'll be right back!
,Sandy:, ...load up the moon wagon? ,[sighs],
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob is at bakery], Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number. ,[attempts to pull a ticket, but fails and gets tangled up],
,Bakerman:, Number 12.
,SpongeBob:, Yes, I'm Number 12!
,Bakerman:, What can I get for you today?
,SpongeBob:, I need a bon voyage sheet cake. ,[Bakerman brings out out sheet cake], Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! ""Have fun on the moon..."". What rhymes with ""moon""? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?
,Bakerman:, How about “loon?”
,SpongeBob:, I got it! ""See you soon!”
,Countdown:, ,[SpongeBob heads back to Sandy’s dome with the cake. The rocket is a few seconds from takeoff], T-minus 12, 11, 10, 9, 8…
,SpongeBob:, No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake! ,[grabs a hold of the ladder, but falls into the rocket], Whoa!
,Sandy:, ,[sees SpongeBob], SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?
,SpongeBob:, ,[panting, and out of breath], I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and…
,Countdown:, Launch commencing.
,Sandy:, Never mind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!
,SpongeBob:, I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip! ,[rocket takes off], Hey, Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy...
,Sandy:, Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight.
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I just wanted to show you the…
,Sandy:, for the afterburners! ,[activates afterburners; propels rocket further], What were you saying, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Oh, I… brought you a “bon voyage” sheet cake.
,Sandy:, You can't bring regular food into space!
,SpongeBob:, Wha, wha, wha, why not?
,Sandy:, Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!
,SpongeBob:, Oh. Is that a bad thing?
,Sandy:, Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive. ,[cake floats into the reverse spatial linearity drive. The rocket engine malfunctions and turns off], Ah nuts!
,SpongeBob:, Oops. Sorry, Sandy.
,Sandy:, ,[presses ""Toss"" button, and gets dressed in a large space suit], Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks. ,[goes into space], Aha! There's our problem. ,[clears the cake out from the the reverse spatial linearity drive.], Eh, could've used more nuts. ,[comes back inside rocket], Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?
,SpongeBob:, Roger that! Folding hands.
,Sandy:, Now, get ready for lunar module se…
,SpongeBob:, ,[folds hands into a bird], What do you think Sandy?
,Sandy:, Just don't touch anything while we separate.
,SpongeBob:, Ok.
,Sandy:, ,[detaches rocket from boosters], That looks like a good spot. ,[lands on the moon, sets camp up], Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding! ,[brings out boards],
,SpongeBob:, What's moon crater boarding?
,Sandy:, You ride these on that like this. ,[jumps on and rides her snowboard on the moon], Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah. ,[flips her board in midair], Right there is the classic Texas tail grab. ,[grabs tail, and twists it into the shape of Texas], And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop. ,[spins and breaks an asteroid into an acorn and eats it], Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite: The Tour to Saturn. ,[lies down on Saturn's rings], Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn.
,SpongeBob:, Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.
,Sandy:, Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn.
,SpongeBob:, I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try. ,[jumps on board and floats off into space], Sandy, this doesn't seem right.
,Sandy:, Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! ,[lassos asteroid to SpongeBob],
,SpongeBob:, ,[grabs onto asteroid], Ok. ,[the rock pulls SpongeBob to the moon surface. SpongeBob begins to surf the moon, but screams],
,Sandy:, Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick? ,[SpongeBob keeps screaming], Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a “Waaaaah!”
,SpongeBob:, ,[SpongeBob continues screaming, and begins to surf over a satellite], Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]
,Frankie Billy:, ,[shifts to Patrick watching TV], Carol, your real father is… ,[TV goes out due to satellite damage],
,Patrick:, Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!
,SpongeBob:, ,[scene returns to SpongeBob], Watch this Sandy! ,[ties an asteroid to his helmet to hold him down], Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up… ,[accidentally smashes into rocket's fuel tank, making it leak], puncture into the side of the rocket.
,Sandy:, You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the ""no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”
,SpongeBob:, Oops!
,Sandy:, Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!
,SpongeBob:, Wait! I have to do something very important! ,[takes picture of himself “holding the earth”], There! ,[both go into the rocket, and head for earth], So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?
,Sandy:, If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic. ,[rocket fuel signs shows “Empty”. Rocket starts falling to earth], Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!
,SpongeBob:, Is that bad?
,Sandy:, ,[unbuckles seatbelt], Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”.
,SpongeBob:, Well, in that case, I won’t… giant fireball?! ,[unbuckles seatbelt, but hits wall], Sandy, where are you going?
,Sandy:, 'm going to take this bull by the horns! ,[Lassos the nose of the rocket. Rocket begins to catch fire as it descends towards earth],
,SpongeBob:, Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
,Sandy:, Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere. ,[the rocket keeps falling at a faster rate. SpongeBob yells in terror], Yeehaw!
,SpongeBob:, ,[continues screaming], My goodness!
,Sandy:, Yeehaw! Yeehaw! ,[rockets crashes],
,SpongeBob:, Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay? ,[Sandy groans], Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation.
,Sandy:, Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes.

,SpongeBob:, Why did you give him the table?
,Mr. Krabs:, You know what they say: ""Money Talks.""
,SpongeBob:, I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out? ,[talking to money], What do you have against old people?
,Mr. Krabs:, Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.
